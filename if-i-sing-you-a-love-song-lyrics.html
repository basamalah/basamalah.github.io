Our voices will somehow fill the earth
With joy forever
I dream that someday
Our wishes will somehoe soon come true and last forever
I dream that one day our songs in some way
Will bring a bright tomorrow
Full of love
Full of hope full of joy
I see this one day
When all the world will hear us
That someday when all will stand before us
Singing one song together
Everywhere singing
We are gonna love you, people of the wirld
We are gonna make you a better world
We will all respect you, people of the world
We are gonna make you a better world.</p>
