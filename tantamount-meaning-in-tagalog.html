                                            5. CASE STUDY: Mr. James Bond is the owner of a grocery store. He uses some of the business merchandise inventory for personal use. He sometimes gets some money of the business to buy his personal needs without any record. He mixes his personal expenses with the business expenses. An accountant called his attention and told him that what he is doing is tantamount to stealing from the business. Mr. James Bond responded that since he is the owner of the business what he is doing is just part of his privilege, and so he is not really stealing from his business. Who is correct? Why?​</a>

                                            Case Study: For Critical Analysis
 Mr. A B. C was brought to court for stealing. The court noted that he has been convicted for similar offenses many times. Can the court put him in prison at this time and with a much heavier penalty?
 Mr. A's defense lawyer argued on A's behalf that A should be spared from prison for he is a Kleptomania-defined as a strong compulsion to steal. Why do you think this qualification is relevant to the case?
 - In law, cases like this, e.g. Kleptomania, has its own appropriate sentence.
- In psychology, kleptomania is tantamount to mental illness and needs treatment.
- In philosophy, underlying question-human freedom and responsibility-need to be examined.
From the philosophical point of view, the case presented earlier takes on different path. Its method of inquiry is holistic and considers many perspective or theories on its approach in solving or assessing problems in society or activities of life. Precisely in real-life situations, one perspective is not enough to show the strength of our decision. Philosophy is about life, and it is for this reason that philosophy is considered a holistic discipline.
Going back to the example, the story of Mr. A B. C is classic example where seemingly there is a conflict between law and reason. As mandated by law, stealing is punishable by law. The saying says : “Dura lex, sed lex – the law is stiff, but it is the law.” The law may seem to be harsh, but it is the law. We live in a community of laws and not of men.
 However, the other context of positive laws that need to be stressed is not the punitive aspect of the law but the rehabilitative attribute. The consideration of mitigating circumstances are situations that need to be examined. Logic demands that no individual can be punished for acts that he has no control of. Thus in the case of Mr. A B. C, kleptomania and other similar acts, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, are mitigating circumstances that lessen responsibility and accountability, but they cannot remove one’s responsibility and accountability. Thus, individuals are still accountable in all their actions.
Based on the case study presented about the case of Mr. A B. C, answer these two fundamental questions:
1. If you were the judge, can you sentence Mr. A. B. C to prison at this time and with heavier penalty?
2. Can a person be accountable for his acts if these are beyond his control?</a>

                                            1. THE CREED (SHAHADA) The basic creed of Islam that "there is no God but Allah; Muhammad is the messenger of Allah" is known as shahada. In Arabic, the shahada is recited as "La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammadon rasul Allah". These are the very first words uttered into an infant's ear and perhaps the last word given to a dying Muslim. That shahada asserts that Allah is the only divinity and that he has relayed his will through Muhammad. To be accepted into the Islam fold, one must recite the kalmia or phrase with two witnesses. The first half of the kalmia is known as tawheed "the unity" which is the most important statement for Muslim faith. The second half is called risallah "acceptance of prophethood" which implies acceptance of prophets as messengers of god. For a Muslim to deny any part of the shahada is tantamount to the crime of reversion to Islam that is punishable under Quranic law.​</a>

Divorce is a process of legally separating two individuals who were bound by marriage. For me, it is completely sound.Around 17 Million children were reported homeless by World Health Organization. It was mentioned that 78% of this is caused by lack of family. Hence, approval of this bill is tantamount to subjecting children to an unnecessary suffering.However, around 50 million women were being abused everyday due to failing marriage. Hunger, fractures, and moral damages were an understatement to their husband. This means that divorce could be a gateway for a better life for a wrong decision that was.Divorce, though many are against, remains as one of the votalite options for curing a failing marriage. It is therefore the responsibility or our country's law-making bodies to fast track the approval of this bill into law. There may never be a perfect marriage, but a peaceful life is achievable when all of us are proactive to the evolving need of the societyThesis :Antithesis:Synthesis:​</a>

                            11. Case Study: For Critical Analysis
 Mr. A B. C was brought to court for stealing. The court noted that he has been convicted for similar offenses many times. Can the court put him in prison at this time and with a much heavier penalty?
 Mr. A's defense lawyer argued on A's behalf that A should be spared from prison for he is a Kleptomania-defined as a strong compulsion to steal. Why do you think this qualification is relevant to the case?
 - In law, cases like this, e.g. Kleptomania, has its own appropriate sentence.
- In psychology, kleptomania is tantamount to mental illness and needs treatment.
- In philosophy, underlying question-human freedom and responsibility-need to be examined.
From the philosophical point of view, the case presented earlier takes on different path. Its method of inquiry is holistic and considers many perspective or theories on its approach in solving or assessing problems in society or activities of life. Precisely in real-life situations, one perspective is not enough to show the strength of our decision. Philosophy is about life, and it is for this reason that philosophy is considered a holistic discipline.
Going back to the example, the story of Mr. A B. C is classic example where seemingly there is a conflict between law and reason. As mandated by law, stealing is punishable by law. The saying says : “Dura lex, sed lex – the law is stiff, but it is the law.” The law may seem to be harsh, but it is the law. We live in a community of laws and not of men.
 However, the other context of positive laws that need to be stressed is not the punitive aspect of the law but the rehabilitative attribute. The consideration of mitigating circumstances are situations that need to be examined. Logic demands that no individual can be punished for acts that he has no control of. Thus in the case of Mr. A B. C, kleptomania and other similar acts, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, are mitigating circumstances that lessen responsibility and accountability, but they cannot remove one’s responsibility and accountability. Thus, individuals are still accountable in all their actions.
Based on the case study presented about the case of Mr. A B. C, answer these two fundamental questions:
1. If you were the judge, can you sentence Mr. A. B. C to prison at this time and with heavier penalty?
2. Can a person be accountable for his acts if these are beyond his control?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>answer</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.   If  you  were  the  judge,  can  you  sentence  Mr. A. B. C  to  prison  at  this  time  and  with heavier  penalty?
</p><p></p><p>                -Kleptomania cannot be considered a legal defense to stealing – not even an insanity defense. Individuals are held responsible for their actions unless it can be clearly proven that they completely lack a sense self-control. The sentence is usually less time for a mental institution than a prison sentence.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Can a person accountable for his act if these are beyond his control?
</p><p></p><p>                  -In  the  case  of  Mr. A B.

                            17. 1. THE CREED (SHAHADA) The basic creed of Islam that "there is no God but Allah; Muhammad is the messenger of Allah" is known as shahada. In Arabic, the shahada is recited as "La ilaha illa Allah, Muhammadon rasul Allah". These are the very first words uttered into an infant's ear and perhaps the last word given to a dying Muslim. That shahada asserts that Allah is the only divinity and that he has relayed his will through Muhammad. To be accepted into the Islam fold, one must recite the kalmia or phrase with two witnesses. The first half of the kalmia is known as tawheed "the unity" which is the most important statement for Muslim faith. The second half is called risallah "acceptance of prophethood" which implies acceptance of prophets as messengers of god. For a Muslim to deny any part of the shahada is tantamount to the crime of reversion to Islam that is punishable under Quranic law.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Consider what the world would be like if there were no traffic rules at all.  Would people be able to travel by automobiles, buses and other vehicles on the roadways if there were no traffic regulations?  The answer should be obvious to all rational members of the human species.  Without basic rules, no matter how much some would like to avoid them or break them, there would be chaos.  The fact that some people break the rules is quite clearly and obviously not sufficient to do away with the rules.  The rules are needed for transportation to take place.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Morality is a good thing.  Immorality is a bad thing.  A person should always do good things and never do bad things.  Doesn't everybody agree?
</p><p>
</p><p>Well, judging by people's behavior, not necessarily.  But we also have to be careful not confuse 'ought' and 'is'.  People do behave immorally.  But they shouldn't.  Everybody knows that - at least in their heart of hearts. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

In the matrix provided below, copy the section that presents the Thesis, Antithesis and SynthesisIt was an undying issue whether divorce should be legalized or not. Divorce is a process of legally separating two individuals who were bound by marriage. For me, it is completely sound.Around 17 Million children were reported homeless by World Health Organization. It was mentioned that 78% of this is caused by lack of family. Hence, approval of this bill is tantamount to subjecting children to an unnecessary suffering.However, around 50 million women were being abused everyday due to failing marriage. Hunger, fractures, and moral damages were an understatement to their husband. This means that divorce could be a gateway for a better life for a wrong decision that was.Divorce, though many are against, remains as one of the votalite options for curing a failing marriage. It is therefore the responsibility or our country's law-making bodies to fast track the approval of this bill into law. There may never be a perfect marriage, but a peaceful life is achievable when all of us are proactive to the evolving need of the societyThesis :Antithesis:Synthesis:​</h2><br />
