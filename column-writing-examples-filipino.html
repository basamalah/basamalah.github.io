                                            Discussion A fact can be proven by using general references such as textbooks, encyclopedia, and the like. It tells us what happened and can be proven true by referring to evidence, observation and research. Opinion expresses an individual point of view. Opinions evaluate, judge or express feelings and emotions that cannot be proven right or wrong. It is what a person believes or thinks about something. Opinion differs from one person to another. Example of Fact: The Philippines is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia that has three main geographical divisions namely: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Dr. Jose Rizal is known as the national hero of the Filipino people. Emilio Aguinaldo is the 1 President of the Republic of the Philippines. The People Power Revolution, also known as the EDSA Revolution, was a series of popular demonstrations in the Philippines from February 22-25, 1986. Taal Volcano is a large caldera filled by Taal Lake in the Philippines which last erupted on January 12, 2020. Example of Opinion: Although Philippines is one small country, it has the happiest people. I like to read novels written by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Emilio Aguinaldo is the best president in the Philippine history. For me, EDSA Revolution is the most peaceful demonstration made by Filipino people. The learners affected by Taal Volcano eruption prefer face to face learning than modular learning. When analyzing reading materials, you may consider that facts show certainties and definite information like numbers and verified record while opinions state the personal feeling of a person about something. It is also easy to look after the signal words that show whether the statement is fact or opinion. Signals words for facts include numbers, dates and statistics while signal words for opinions include words such as “prefer”, “think”, “should”, “like” and “best”. A. Directions: Look at the picture below and tell whether the following sentences state fact or opinion. Write F for fact and O for opinion. Do this in your notebook. B.

                            7. Discussion A fact can be proven by using general references such as textbooks, encyclopedia, and the like. It tells us what happened and can be proven true by referring to evidence, observation and research. Opinion expresses an individual point of view. Opinions evaluate, judge or express feelings and emotions that cannot be proven right or wrong. It is what a person believes or thinks about something. Opinion differs from one person to another. Example of Fact: The Philippines is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia that has three main geographical divisions namely: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Dr. Jose Rizal is known as the national hero of the Filipino people. Emilio Aguinaldo is the 1 President of the Republic of the Philippines. The People Power Revolution, also known as the EDSA Revolution, was a series of popular demonstrations in the Philippines from February 22-25, 1986. Taal Volcano is a large caldera filled by Taal Lake in the Philippines which last erupted on January 12, 2020. Example of Opinion: Although Philippines is one small country, it has the happiest people. I like to read novels written by Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Emilio Aguinaldo is the best president in the Philippine history. For me, EDSA Revolution is the most peaceful demonstration made by Filipino people. The learners affected by Taal Volcano eruption prefer face to face learning than modular learning. When analyzing reading materials, you may consider that facts show certainties and definite information like numbers and verified record while opinions state the personal feeling of a person about something. It is also easy to look after the signal words that show whether the statement is fact or opinion. Signals words for facts include numbers, dates and statistics while signal words for opinions include words such as “prefer”, “think”, “should”, “like” and “best”. A. Directions: Look at the picture below and tell whether the following sentences state fact or opinion. Write F for fact and O for opinion. Do this in your notebook. B. Directions: Classify the following statements whether they are fact or opinion. Write them on their proper column. Do this in your answer sheet. 1. Electricity can produce magnets. 2.

The best generator is made of electromagnet. 10. Perhaps magnet should be used to add more electricity. Fact Opinion 1. 1. 2. 2. 3. 3. 4. 4. 5. 5. C. Directions: Encircle the word fact if the sentence is a true concept and opinion if it is based on personal feelings. Do this in your answer sheet. 1. One year is composed of 12 months.
