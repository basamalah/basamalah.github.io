                                            Our Wildlife, Our Treasure 'Various sources describe wildlife as the many kinds of plants and animals that grow and live in the wild. The animals in this classification have very little contact with humans; thus, they are undomesticated or wild. Included in the Philippine wildlife are birds, reptiles, and amphibians, of which there are 1,437 species of this, 711 species are endemic or native to our country. S. SY 29. vedia Commons The water that surrounds our archipelago is teeming with corals and is home to more than 2,000 species of fish. Our coral reefs have attracted tourists who marvel at their beauty. Our forests boast of different species of animals. Among these are the Philippine crocodile found in Mindoro, the tarsler of Bohol, the bearcat, the mouse deer or pilandok of Palawan, the pygmy Carlos SY 20, comma fruit bat, and the Philippine eagle in Mindanao. Our country is also a rich habitat for different plants. The pitcher plant, which is actually a camivorous plant; the Philippine teak tree, which grows up to 25 meters high, the almaciga, an evergreen large tree, the Philippine date palm; and some orchids are among these. But while we boast of these blessings, many of these species are threatened or endangered. This is why the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has taken steps to stop the further destruction and loss of Philippine wildlife. "Undersecretary Rodolfo Garcia of DENR said that "public action and cooperation on protecting wildlife would help bolster government's campaign to curb trafficking and other crimes against this natural resource." Republic Act 9147 or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act defines wildlife as 'wild forms and varieties of flora and fauna, in all developmental stages, including those which are in captivity or are being bred or propagated."five world plant and animals help maintain not right balance there are also use it to flow the new high birds of plant and animals and and conducting experiment this feature of filipinos when they encounter this plant and animals match 3 forever year is named word wednesday or wwd  by the united nations connected general assembly beneficial you not help and conservation ​</a>

1. The Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
The Duterte administration’s COVID-19 response marries incompetence with militarism.
By Michael Beltran
May 12, 2020
The Philippine government has been boasting that as early as March 16, they had the gumption to implement a lockdown in major cities and provinces in response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror.
The implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) came on the heels of serious negligence— namely, the authorities failing to keep up with the preventive measures of neighboring countries and grossly underestimating the virus. What’s worse, instead of easing the overall burden that the virus unleashed on the country, it seems the last resort lockdown itself added to a plethora of problems without adequately addressing the primary crisis at hand: ensuring public health and safety.
Strict compliance with the ECQ is ordered for all citizens, with the exception of frontline professionals, until at least May 15. That has meant curfews, harsh penalties for being outside, and an impoverished population descending.
The global crisis is first and foremost a public health issue, but Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has faced the coronavirus pandemic in a decidedly militaristic fashion. Since the lockdown went into effect, he has peddled the narrative of pasaways or “undisciplined” citizens as responsible for the ensuing problems. He has also brought up unsubstantiated activities of guerrilla groups as threats to government aid efforts without conceding any missteps in his management. On top of deploying thousands of police and soldiers throughout the archipelago to enforce the ECQ, Duterte has on two occasions threatened the public with all-out martial law. There have been moments of abject incompetence from those in power around the world but using the pandemic as a reason for increasingly flexing authoritarian muscles spells danger for the Philippines post-lockdown.
2. COVID-19: A promising cure for the global panic
ABSTRACT. The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID 19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeuticstargetingSARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.</a>

                            4. Our Wildlife, Our Treasure 'Various sources describe wildlife as the many kinds of plants and animals that grow and live in the wild. The animals in this classification have very little contact with humans; thus, they are undomesticated or wild. Included in the Philippine wildlife are birds, reptiles, and amphibians, of which there are 1,437 species of this, 711 species are endemic or native to our country. S. SY 29. vedia Commons The water that surrounds our archipelago is teeming with corals and is home to more than 2,000 species of fish. Our coral reefs have attracted tourists who marvel at their beauty. Our forests boast of different species of animals. Among these are the Philippine crocodile found in Mindoro, the tarsler of Bohol, the bearcat, the mouse deer or pilandok of Palawan, the pygmy Carlos SY 20, comma fruit bat, and the Philippine eagle in Mindanao. Our country is also a rich habitat for different plants. The pitcher plant, which is actually a camivorous plant; the Philippine teak tree, which grows up to 25 meters high, the almaciga, an evergreen large tree, the Philippine date palm; and some orchids are among these. But while we boast of these blessings, many of these species are threatened or endangered. This is why the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has taken steps to stop the further destruction and loss of Philippine wildlife. "Undersecretary Rodolfo Garcia of DENR said that "public action and cooperation on protecting wildlife would help bolster government's campaign to curb trafficking and other crimes against this natural resource."

1. The Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
The Duterte administration’s COVID-19 response marries incompetence with militarism.
By Michael Beltran
May 12, 2020
The Philippine government has been boasting that as early as March 16, they had the gumption to implement a lockdown in major cities and provinces in response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror.
The implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) came on the heels of serious negligence— namely, the authorities failing to keep up with the preventive measures of neighboring countries and grossly underestimating the virus. What’s worse, instead of easing the overall burden that the virus unleashed on the country, it seems the last resort lockdown itself added to a plethora of problems without adequately addressing the primary crisis at hand: ensuring public health and safety.
Strict compliance with the ECQ is ordered for all citizens, with the exception of frontline professionals, until at least May 15. That has meant curfews, harsh penalties for being outside, and an impoverished population descending.
The global crisis is first and foremost a public health issue, but Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has faced the coronavirus pandemic in a decidedly militaristic fashion. Since the lockdown went into effect, he has peddled the narrative of pasaways or “undisciplined” citizens as responsible for the ensuing problems. He has also brought up unsubstantiated activities of guerrilla groups as threats to government aid efforts without conceding any missteps in his management. On top of deploying thousands of police and soldiers throughout the archipelago to enforce the ECQ, Duterte has on two occasions threatened the public with all-out martial law. There have been moments of abject incompetence from those in power around the world but using the pandemic as a reason for increasingly flexing authoritarian muscles spells danger for the Philippines post-lockdown.
2. COVID-19: A promising cure for the global panic
ABSTRACT. The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID 19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeuticstargetingSARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.</h2><br />
