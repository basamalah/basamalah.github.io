If Suzie wanted to jump rope, June wanted to play hopscotch. 11 June wanted to watch soap operas, Suzie wanted to watch talk shows. Tensions rose to the point that the girls could no longer stand one another's company. It seemed that they had nothing in common, until the day that progress reports went home. On the bus the girls were started by how upset the other looked. They realized that they were both failing a subject. Suzie was failing math and June was failing reading, Since both girls wanted to pass their classes, they agreed to help one another. So after school for the next few weeks, Suzie tutored June in reading and then June tutored Suzie in math. By the time report cards were distributed, Suzie and June were passing all their classes. The girls were delighted, but their mother was happiest of all. Not just because her daughters had passed their classes, but because they learned to be good sisters. y It n e What is the theme of this story? 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>title of the story:        "The Ugly Duckling" Storycharacter:Ugly Duckling,Other Ducklings,Mother Duck,Wild Geese,Hen,Swans<p></p>The Setting of "The Ugly Duckling":<p>There are several settings in the story. The story begins in the country during the summertime on a farm. Then, the scene shifts to a pond where the mother duck tries to teach her babies the way of the world. Soon, we venture into another moor where the ugly duckling encounters the wild geese, dogs, and gunshots, and from here, he finds a cottage where a hen and a cat convince him to try to become a hen or a cat. When that doesn't work out, he goes to a large lake. Here, he sees the swans; the time of year transitions into winter, and the ugly duckling gets picked from the frozen lake and taken into a home to thaw. Once warmed, he scrambles outside and somehow survives the winter. Finally, after a long winter, the weather warms again as he becomes a beautiful swan, which he discovered amongst other swans in a lake.</p><p></p>SUMMARY: <p>The story tells of a plain-looking little bird (the Ugly Duckling) born in a barnyard. His brothers and sisters as well as the other birds and animals on the farm tease him for being plain and ugly, so he runs off to live with a flock of wild ducks and geese until hunters shoot down the flock. Alone again, the Ugly Duckling finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen also tease him, so he doesn't stay there long.</p><p></p><p>In his wanderings, the Ugly Duckling comes across a flock of migrating swans, and he wishes to join them but can't because he's too young and can't fly well enough. When winter sets in, a farmer rescues the Ugly Duckling, but the farmer's children and other animals frighten him with their noise and teasing, so again, he flees. He spends a cold and lonely winter hiding in a cave until springtime, when the flock of swans comes to the lake near his hiding place.</p><p></p><p>When the Ugly Duckling approaches the swans, he's delighted to find that they accept him and treat him like one of them. When he looks at his reflection in the lake, he realizes, to his astonishment, that he's matured into a beautiful swan himself. When the swans fly off from the lake, he spreads his wings and joins them, finally having found a family who accepts him.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, an ugly, large duckling was hatched into an otherwise little family of perfect ducks. He was so different looking that the mother thought he might even be a turkey. Even though she felt him large and ugly like everyone else did, the mother duck complimented his ability to swim very well. As he was the last of the brood to hatch, she assumed that it was because he spent so much time in the egg that he had turned out so ugly.</p><p></p><p>The ugly duckling looks nothing like the other chicks when he is born.</p><p></p><p>The ugly duckling</p><p></p><p>On the first outing for the family, the mother duck tried to teach her baby ducklings the way of the pond. The other ducks that were already there pointed out how ugly the largest duckling was. The mother again came to his defense as best as she could. Even with the mother attempting to support him, the ugly duckling was nipped at and pushed around by the other animals. They made fun of his odd, white, plain-looking coloring while everyone else was a pretty duckling yellow. Eventually, it got to be too much for the ugly duckling, and he ran away to escape the abuse.</p><p></p><p>He then found himself in a large moor with plenty of wild ducks. They pointed out his ugliness, but they did not send him away. While there, some wild geese invited him to fly with them, but shortly after the invitation had been extended, the geese were shot. A dog quickly ran over, and the ugly duckling thought himself surely dead, but the dog ran off without injuring him.</p><p></p>#cary on learning#patama kung malu<br />
