                                            ACTIVITY 7 Instruction: Compute the market share of the given situation. (20 points) Mrs. Conny wants to launch a rice retailing business in her barangay. She wants to know if the venture is worth her capital and effort. She noticed that there are approximately 500 families in her barangay and since rice is the staple food in the Philippines all of the 500 families are potential target market. They consume an average of 1.8 kilograms of rice per day. There are 3 other rice retailers in the barangay that have been operating for 12 years and they have an equal market share of 25 percent the other 25 percent came from groceries that sales the product in bulk or in sack. She also found out that 15 pesos is the average net profit per kilo of rice. The market size of the venture= Number of families who buy and eat rice x average consumption per annum Market size=                    =Market size profit =                               =The plan of Mrs. Conny is to capture the 35 percent of the market by providing free delivery to the customer, because none of her competitors have used this strategy. She plans to reduce the net profit per kilo by 6 pesos to cover the expenses for delivery (reduce mark-up price by 6 pesos). 3 rice retailers are her direct competitor because they offer the same product (rice sold per kilo) and the groceries are indirect competitors because they don't sell the rice per kilo (rice sold per sack). Potential Market Share =                                        =                                       =Potential Market Share: =Potential Market Share = ​</a>

                            20. ACTIVITY 7 Instruction: Compute the market share of the given situation. (20 points) Mrs. Conny wants to launch a rice retailing business in her barangay. She wants to know if the venture is worth her capital and effort. She noticed that there are approximately 500 families in her barangay and since rice is the staple food in the Philippines all of the 500 families are potential target market. They consume an average of 1.8 kilograms of rice per day. There are 3 other rice retailers in the barangay that have been operating for 12 years and they have an equal market share of 25 percent the other 25 percent came from groceries that sales the product in bulk or in sack. She also found out that 15 pesos is the average net profit per kilo of rice. The market size of the venture= Number of families who buy and eat rice x average consumption per annum Market size=                    =Market size profit =                               =The plan of Mrs. Conny is to capture the 35 percent of the market by providing free delivery to the customer, because none of her competitors have used this strategy. She plans to reduce the net profit per kilo by 6 pesos to cover the expenses for delivery (reduce mark-up price by 6 pesos). 3 rice retailers are her direct competitor because they offer the same product (rice sold per kilo) and the groceries are indirect competitors because they don't sell the rice per kilo (rice sold per sack). Potential Market Share =                                        =                                       =Potential Market Share: =Potential Market Share = ​</h2><br />
