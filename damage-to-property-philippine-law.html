                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

If you were to be asked about the bill, what is your stand it? Do you support the bill into becoming a law or would you agree on what the opposition stated? Tell us what is on your mind!

                            4. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

It is a rapid flooding of low-lying areas caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, or tropical storm. It has a timescale of six hours or less between the rainfall and the onset of flooding. 3. It is a weather disturbance that brings wind, rain, and destruction. 4. It is the result of a sudden release of stored energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. 5. It is a catastrophic event with atmospheric, geological, and hydrological origins (e.g., droughts, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, landslides) that can cause fatalities, property damage and social environmental disruption. 6. It refers to the abnormal rise in seawater level during a storm caused primarily by the storm's winds pushing the water onshore. 7. It is identified by DENR-MGB as a flood-prone province located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Its provincial capital is Buluan. 8. This phenomenon occurs when the water level in a river, lake or stream rises and overflows onto the surrounding banks, shores and neighboring land. 9.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>A volcano</strong> is essentially an opening or a vent through which this magma and the dissolved gases it contains are discharged.</p><p>2. What are <strong>Flash Floods</strong>? A flash flood is a rapid flooding of geomorphic low-lying areas: flood plains, river valleys, coastal plains. It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, tropical storm, or meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or anowfields.</p><p>3. A <strong>tropical cyclone</strong> brings very violent winds, torrential rain, high waves and, in some cases, very destructive storm surges and coastal flooding. The winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.</p><p>4. An <strong>earthquake</strong> is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates vibrations or seismic waves that radiate up to the surface, causing the ground to shake.</p><p>5. </p><p>6. <strong>Storm surge</strong> is the abnormal rise in seawater level during a storm, measured as the height of the water above the normal predicted astronomical tide.
