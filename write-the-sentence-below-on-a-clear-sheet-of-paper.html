Locating a specific place would not be possible if not for Earth'smodels such as maps and globes. Ais a two-dimensional drawing whichcan be used on flat surfaces and is easily carried. On the other hand, ais a three-dimensional representation of the spherical shape of Earth. A uniquefeature of a globe is Earth's tilt with respect to its North and South Poles. It alsorepresents Earth's position relative to Sun. Through time, both models haveundergone modifications to represent Earth better.A common feature of maps and globes is the presence ofhorizontal and vertical lines to form a Cartesian plane. These imaginary lines form agrid collectively known as the geographic coordinate system. The geographiccoordinate system does not exist but it was drawn as a numerical reference whichdetermines the locations of different places on Earth. Locating places on a map orglobe uses these lines which are represented as() since it is assumedthat the world is spherical. Most maps usually draw these lines apart at a 15°intervalLines which run horizontally from east to west are calledTheselines areto each other. Hence, latitudes do not meet or intersect. Thelatitude which cuts the Earth in half is called theThis line divides Earthintoandhemispheres. As a reference point, the equatoris read as 0° latitude. The degreeas it approaches the two poles whichare read as 90°north latitude 190°N) or 90° south latitude (90°S).The closer the latitude is to the equator, thethe climate. Thecloser it is to the poles, theThus, it is clear that there is a relationshipbetween the latitude of a place and the climate it experiences,​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Experiment with Mirrors
<p>
</p><p><strong>After trying out the experiment in front of a plane mirror, here is what I have observed:</strong>
</p>The letters of the alphabet that are capitalized that can still be read properly when standing in front of a mirror are the following: A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, and Y.
The words that are in capital letters that we can write and still be read in front of a mirror are the following: AHA, HUH, MAM, MOM, MUM, TAT, T I T, TOT, WOW. These words are referred to as mirrored palindromes. Others refer to it as ambigrams.
It is very challenging to write an English sentence that uses only palindromes/ambigram, but here is a mixed of English and Tagalog sentences that is uses palindrome/ambigram:
AMA! (Father!)
AHA! (Aha!)
MOM? HUH?!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Currently, Earth is composed of seven continents surrounded by differentbodies of water. Locating a specific place would not be possible if not for Earth’s models such as maps and globes. A MAP is a two-dimensional drawing which can be used on flat surfaces and is easily carried. On the other hand, a GLOBE is a three-dimensional representation of the spherical shape of Earth. A unique feature of a globe is Earth’s tilt with respect to its North and South Poles. It also represents Earth’s position relative to Sun. Through time, both models have undergone modifications to represent Earth better.A common feature of maps and globes is the presence of INTERSECTING horizontal and vertical lines to form a Cartesian plane. These imaginary lines form a grid collectively known as the geographic coordinate system. The geographic coordinate system does not exist but it was drawn as a numerical reference which determines the locations of different places on Earth. Locating places on a map or globe uses these lines which are represented as DEGREES (°) since it is assumed that the world is spherical. Most maps usually draw these lines apart at a 15º interval.Lines which run horizontally from east to west are called LATITUDE. Theselines are PARALLEL to each other. Hence, latitudes do not meet or intersect. The latitude which cuts the Earth in half is called the EQUATOR. This line divides Earth into NORTHERN and SOUTHERN hemispheres. As a reference point, the equator is read as 0º latitude. The degree INCREASES as it approaches the two poles which are read as 90ºnorth latitude (90ºN) or 90º south latitude (90ºS).The closer the latitude is to the equator, the WARMER the climate. The closer it is to the poles, the COLD. Thus, it is clear that there is a relationship between the latitude of a place and the climate it experiences.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> </p>sana makatulong<br />
