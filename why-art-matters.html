                        Artists put themselves into their artwork. They express who they are, what they feel, what are their thoughts, their personalities, their views about their surroundings, in the form of art they are making. They make their artworks their world, and that's what makes an artwork unique.SUGGESTED ART MATERIALS Powder paint, long handled brushes, clay, chalk, large crayons, large pieces of paper, cardboard, oak tag wrap- ping paper, wooden boxes, orange crates, wall paper, and textiles may be used for constructive handwork and pro- jects such as commuities, houses, toys, farms, or buildings.Materials are what things are made from. Materials have different qualities: they can be smooth or rough; hard or soft; heavy or light; fragile or indestructible. Artists choose materials because of their particular qualites. The same material can be used in very different ways to achieve very different results.Artists often use a particular medium because it affects the texture or color of the work of art. Other times, the artist will choose a medium because it helps the audience interpret the art in a specific way.The stuff that artists use when they make a work of art influences both form and content. Every material brings something special to the creative process and the finished work. Materials influence how artists make their work and how viewers perceive it.<p></p><p>Hope it helps pa brainlist po</p><br />
