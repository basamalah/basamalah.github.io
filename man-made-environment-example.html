Social Sciences are interrelated and interconnected disciplines that study man's social aspect. There are a handful of Social Science disciplines, and the way to distinguish them from each other is to look at their different (1) or focus of study. In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions.

                        <p>Estuaries provide us with a wide range of resources, benefits, and services. 
</p><p>Estuaries provide places for habitat of valuable species of plants and animals, 
</p><p>recreational activities, scientific study, important centers for transportation, 
</p><p>and international commerce. Estuaries are irreplaceable natural resources 
</p><p>that must be managed carefully for the mutual benefit of all who enjoy and 
</p><p>demand on them.
</p><p>• Estuaries rank among the most productive ecosystems on earth, but 
</p><p>they are also subject to considerable ecological degradation associated with the 
</p><p>loss and alteration of habitats and impairment of water quality due to multiple 
</p><p>anthropogenic and natural drivers of change
</p><p>• Escalating population growth, urban and industrial development, 
</p><p>modification of coastal watersheds and estuarine basins, pollution inputs, and 
</p><p>overharvest of recreational and commercial species can threaten the system 
</p><p>structure and function and the sustainability of the system resources.
</p><p>• Putting coconut fiber mat, planting marsh grass, and Mussels bed are 
</p><p>some activities that protect our estuaries and intertidal environment.</p><p></p><p>Why is the Intertidal Zone Important?
</p><p>The intertidal or littoral zone maintains a balance between the land and the 
</p><p>sea. It provides a home to specially adapted marine plants and animals. Those 
</p><p>organisms, in turn, serve as food for many other animals.
</p><p>The intertidal zone also staves off erosion caused by storms. Oyster reefs are 
</p><p>one such example of a protective feature. This helps protect the structures built 
</p><p>by people.
</p><p>The intertidal zone is also an important indicator for climate change on marine 
</p><p>organisms.
</p><p>The intertidal zone is a delicate ecosystem, threatened by rising sea levels due 
</p><p>to climate change. Development by humans threatens the intertidal zone as 
</p><p>well.
</p><p>Changes in temperature due to climate change also threaten the organisms 
</p><p>outright. 
</p><p>The intertidal zone is also susceptible to pollution and trash. When you explore a 
</p><p>beach, rocky shores or tide pools, leave shells for the hermit crabs. Collect any 
</p><p>trash you see. Volunteer to help conserve this fascinating ecosystem.
</p><p>• Estuaries serve as the breeding ground of organisms that play a vital role 
</p><p>in the balance of nature.
</p><p>• There are so many ways in protecting and conserving our estuaries but 
</p><p>the simplest and easiest way to conserve is to conserve water and native 
</p><p>plants which do not require fertilizers.
</p><p>• According to study, the economy of many coastal areas is based primarily 
</p><p>on the natural beauty and bounty of estuaries. When those natural 
</p><p>resources are imperiled, so are the livelihoods of those who live and work 
</p><p>in estuarine watersheds.
</p><p>• The use of fertilizers, sewage from falling septic tanks, pet waste, 
</p><p>wastewater discharge from industrial facilities, sediment from construction 
</p><p>sites, and the rapid increase in population are the main reasons that 
</p><p>makes estuarine system imbalance.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1 true</p><p>2.true</p><p>3.false</p><p>4.true</p><p>5.true</p><p>6.false</p><p>7.false</p><p>8.true</p><p>9.true</p><p>10.true</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>tama po iyan </p><p>ihope its help</p><p>carry on learing </p><br />

Social Sciences are interrelated and interconnected disciplines that study man's social aspect. There are a handful of Social Science disciplines, and the way to distinguish them from each other is to look at their different (1) or focus of study. In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions. Family, friends, religion, economy, and mass media are some examples of structures or patterns of our interactions​</h2><br />
