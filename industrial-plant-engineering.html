                                            [UNRELATED]❗PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME TO READ❗This is Peter Kalmus, a NASA scientist and Climate Activist who's recently got arrested alongside with other activist by the cops because of their PEACEFUL PROTEST. He said that we only got less than 3 years to fix our climate before we will face catastrophic consequences of Global Warming and the government didn't do something. They want to end the use of fossil fuels and other bad sources of energy that rises the temperature of our environment.We are clearly facing the consequences slowly like how numbers cyclones recently increased and caused a major impact to our country like Typhoon Odette and Bagyong Agaton. Global Warming is also a major cause of natural disasters such as Cyclones and recent study shows that the global temperature increased for the last few decades.Sadly, most people don't even care and government doesn't listen and industrial companies are still continually destroying our planet. It's is so sad people like Peter Kalmus and Greta Thunberg are risking their lives just for the good of our lives, for our planet, and also for the future generation.HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP OUR CLIMATE:●Lessen the use of fossil fuels and find renewable source if possible.●Avoid burning garbages, this is one of our normalized hobbit but it needs to be stopped especially if most of the trash are made with plastic which is a made of carbon.●Save energy and supplies.● Donate and support Non-governmental Organizations activities that help fight Global warming.People like Peter and other activist gives us hope for humanity even though they risked their lives for our future and to the children of this generation. They show how selfish and unconcerned the government and the industry just for the sake of economy and money. #econotegoLet's fight those problems together.Show love to our Mother Earth ❤#LetTheEarthBreath#SaveMotherNature#ProtectOurPlanet:¨·.·¨: `·.Let the earth breath‼️SIMPLE WAYS TO HELP!SPREAD THIS ‼️ways to help :- delete unwanted emails- save electricity- save water- drive less- plant more trees- avoid smoking- unplug electronics u don’t use- use electric fan instead of aircon- use LED lights- spread awareness to your family and friends#LetTheEarthBreathe #ScienceProtestPlease don't ignore and take time to read these.NASA scientists got arrested for protesting about climate and according to the scientists we only have 4-5 years to save earth.

Fossil Fuels are non-renewable type of energy resource.3. Fossil fuels are composed of hydrocarbons4. There are three types of fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas5 Coat is a solid rock form of fossil fuel that onginated from the dead plant and animalmatter that piled up in layers for over million years ago.6. Oll also known as petroleum, is a liquid type of fossil fuel composed mostly ofhydrocarbons.7. Natural gas is a type of fossil fuel that is odorless, colorless hydrocarbon gas. Andis made mostly of methane (CHA).8. Fossil fuels are commonly used as energy to power engines and other materials athome and Industries for these to work9. Fossil fuels as non-renewable source of energy have disadvantages and couldimpact negatively to the environment especially during its combustion since itproduces carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases​</a>

                                            Date: April 11, 2023 Most Essential Learning Competency (MELC) TOPIC SCIENCE 7 INTERVENTION Learning Task A. Reading Selection Electricity may be described as a form of energy. Understanding electricity entails understanding charges - the basic unit of electricity. Charge is a quantity measured in Coulombs (C). Charges may be transferred to and from objects and may move in conductors as current measured in Amperes (I). The world we live in is highly dependent on the electric energy and power (measured in Watts) supplied by our power plants. The unit watt (W) is named to honor James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine during the industrial revolution. Electric charge is an intrinsic property of protons and electrons. Charge is a quantity with a magnitude and unit. The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C). A neutron has zero net electrical charge because it is neutral A proton carries a positive charge (+e), while electron carries a negative charge (-e). These two types of charges (positive and negative) were named by Benjamin Franklin. JJ. Thomson discovered the electron an Robert Millikan discovered the charge of the electron. The charge of the electron is the negative of the elementary charge e which is equal to 1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb. The charge of the electron and the proton are the same only that the proton is positive (+1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb). Like sign of charges repel and unlike sign of charges attract each other. Materials may contain several charges and when these are neutral, they contain equal numbers of positive and negative charges. Materials or bodies may be left with a certain charge. This may be done through the process of charging. charging means gaining or losing electrons. There are various types of charging processes namely, charging by friction, charging by conduction, and charging by induction. Let us describe first the process of charging through friction. Guide Questions: 1. What is the charge of a neutron? 2. Who discovered the electron? Describe the different types of charging processes (MELC 21) Electricity There are many different types of atoms, and these atoms can combine in a variety of ways to form the nature of objects we encounter every day. Depending on the type of atoms an object is made of, an object can be more or less attracted to an electron. This electrical property is known as electron affinity. If an object has a high electron affinity, then it is more attractive to electrons. Different materials have different affinities of electrons. This is important as we explore the most common methods of charging-triboelectri charging, also known as charging by friction or rubbing. 3. Who invented the steam engine? 4. What is electron affinity? 5. What is electricity? 6. What is current? 7. What is the unit of power? 8. What is the charge? 9. What is triboelectric charging? 10. How can materials be charged?​</a>

                                            II. Identify the type of propaganda used or described. Write your answer before the number.Propugedal. This propaganda is all about persuading the target audience to take action. It's about creatingan urge amongst people to become a part of the "in crowd”.2. Maybelline uses the phrase "America's Favorite"?3. It involves the deliberate omission of certain facts to fool the target audience.4. Some companies may cleverly conceal "hidden charges" and only talk about the benefits oftheir products and services.5. The ultimate goal here is to demonstrate how the product is meant for everybody and willprovide value to everyone.6. It is a method commonly used in the world of advertising as the general public has startedgrow skeptical towards paid celebrity endorsements.7. This is popular advertising technique that uses renowned or celebrity figures to endorseproducts and services. Now in this case, when a famous person vouches for something,viewers are likely to take account of the credibility and popularity of that person.8. This establishes trust and boosts the crechbility of that particular brand. Consequently, somebrands may also use figures like doctors and engineers (basically experts) to promote theirproducts and services.9. Glittering generalities is a propaganda technique where propagandists use emotional appealor/and vague statenents to influence the audience.10. Advertising agencies thus use of phrases like as "inspiring you from within" or "to kick-startyour day to create positive anecdotes. This makes the product look more appealing, resultingin better sales11. This type of propaganda uses a completely opposite approach to glittering generalities. As thename suggests, this propaganda technique involves using derogatory phrases to create anegative opinion about someone or some other brand,12. A company that sells plant-based products may talk about how inhumane it is to kill animalsFor this purpose, they may also criticize fast food chains businesses.13. This type of propaganda uses a technique to project certain qualities (this can either bepositive or negative) of a person, ideology or object to other things and people14. Major soft-drink brands were accused of having traces of pesticides a couple of years ago.While these allegations were on the rise, the entire carbonated-drink industry took a hit.During this same period, fruit juices and other drinks were able to do great business.15. It originates from gambling and cars when players try to stack decks in their favor​</a>

                        they are altirnating the genes of the plant<br />thus making an increase in production or the bearing of fruits <br />and also making the GMO less likely to rot faster. An example of this is when they travel goods from the province to the cities. The rotting process is already taking place while it is traveling. So making the food not go to waste they taught of an alternative thus making GMO a hit in our country and also in many other countries.<br />

                        Hypothetically modified or genetically engineered plants and animals:<p>There is a <strong>variety </strong>of hypothetically modified or genetically engineered plants and animals that could be used for various purposes, including in the health industry, agriculture, and even in our environmental protection.</p><p> Here are a few examples that can be adapted:</p><strong>Golden Rice</strong>: Golden Rice can be a<strong> modified</strong> variety of rice that has been engineered to produce beta-carotene, a good source of vitamin A. The potential to address vitamin A deficiency in developing countries can lead to blindness and other health problems.<strong>Bioluminescent Trees:</strong> Scientists are currently exploring the <strong>possibility </strong>of genetically engineering trees to produce some bioluminescence, which could help lessen the need for artificial lighting and could have energy-saving benefits in the future.<strong>Oil-Eating Bacteria: </strong>This kind of bacteria can be <strong>genetically </strong>modified to consume oil, which could make them advantageous for cleaning up<strong> oil spills </strong>and other<strong> environmental d</strong>isasters which are common in some parts of the world. <strong>Cows that can produce breast milk like humans: </strong>Some<strong> scientists </strong>proved that by<strong> exploring</strong> the possibility of naturally engineering cows to produce milk that is similar to human breast milk, which could provide a more<strong> sustainable</strong> and<strong> ethical </strong>source of infant formula. Since some of the mothers can't produce breast milk and go directly to powdered milk.<strong>Disease-Resistant Crops: </strong>This kind of engineering crops to be resistant to certain diseases, some of the farmers could reduce the need for <strong>harmful </strong>pesticides, which could<strong> harm </strong>our environment and may endanger our health.<p></p><p>These are just a<strong> handful </strong>of these speculative uses for genetic engineering. With the <strong>technology </strong>or<strong> innovation</strong> that is timely occurring in the present, it should be thoroughly evaluated for both its potential <strong>advantages</strong> and<strong> possible </strong>hazards.

                            6. [UNRELATED]❗PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME TO READ❗This is Peter Kalmus, a NASA scientist and Climate Activist who's recently got arrested alongside with other activist by the cops because of their PEACEFUL PROTEST. He said that we only got less than 3 years to fix our climate before we will face catastrophic consequences of Global Warming and the government didn't do something. They want to end the use of fossil fuels and other bad sources of energy that rises the temperature of our environment.We are clearly facing the consequences slowly like how numbers cyclones recently increased and caused a major impact to our country like Typhoon Odette and Bagyong Agaton. Global Warming is also a major cause of natural disasters such as Cyclones and recent study shows that the global temperature increased for the last few decades.Sadly, most people don't even care and government doesn't listen and industrial companies are still continually destroying our planet. It's is so sad people like Peter Kalmus and Greta Thunberg are risking their lives just for the good of our lives, for our planet, and also for the future generation.HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP OUR CLIMATE:●Lessen the use of fossil fuels and find renewable source if possible.●Avoid burning garbages, this is one of our normalized hobbit but it needs to be stopped especially if most of the trash are made with plastic which is a made of carbon.●Save energy and supplies.● Donate and support Non-governmental Organizations activities that help fight Global warming.People like Peter and other activist gives us hope for humanity even though they risked their lives for our future and to the children of this generation. They show how selfish and unconcerned the government and the industry just for the sake of economy and money. #econotegoLet's fight those problems together.Show love to our Mother Earth ❤#LetTheEarthBreath#SaveMotherNature#ProtectOurPlanet:¨·.·¨: `·.Let the earth breath‼️SIMPLE WAYS TO HELP!SPREAD THIS ‼️ways to help :- delete unwanted emails- save electricity- save water- drive less- plant more trees- avoid smoking- unplug electronics u don’t use- use electric fan instead of aircon- use LED lights- spread awareness to your family and friends#LetTheEarthBreathe #ScienceProtestPlease don't ignore and take time to read these.NASA scientists got arrested for protesting about climate and according to the scientists we only have 4-5 years to save earth.

                            9. Date: April 11, 2023 Most Essential Learning Competency (MELC) TOPIC SCIENCE 7 INTERVENTION Learning Task A. Reading Selection Electricity may be described as a form of energy. Understanding electricity entails understanding charges - the basic unit of electricity. Charge is a quantity measured in Coulombs (C). Charges may be transferred to and from objects and may move in conductors as current measured in Amperes (I). The world we live in is highly dependent on the electric energy and power (measured in Watts) supplied by our power plants. The unit watt (W) is named to honor James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine during the industrial revolution. Electric charge is an intrinsic property of protons and electrons. Charge is a quantity with a magnitude and unit. The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C). A neutron has zero net electrical charge because it is neutral A proton carries a positive charge (+e), while electron carries a negative charge (-e). These two types of charges (positive and negative) were named by Benjamin Franklin. JJ. Thomson discovered the electron an Robert Millikan discovered the charge of the electron. The charge of the electron is the negative of the elementary charge e which is equal to 1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb. The charge of the electron and the proton are the same only that the proton is positive (+1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb). Like sign of charges repel and unlike sign of charges attract each other. Materials may contain several charges and when these are neutral, they contain equal numbers of positive and negative charges. Materials or bodies may be left with a certain charge. This may be done through the process of charging. charging means gaining or losing electrons. There are various types of charging processes namely, charging by friction, charging by conduction, and charging by induction. Let us describe first the process of charging through friction. Guide Questions: 1. What is the charge of a neutron? 2. Who discovered the electron? Describe the different types of charging processes (MELC 21) Electricity There are many different types of atoms, and these atoms can combine in a variety of ways to form the nature of objects we encounter every day. Depending on the type of atoms an object is made of, an object can be more or less attracted to an electron. This electrical property is known as electron affinity. If an object has a high electron affinity, then it is more attractive to electrons. Different materials have different affinities of electrons. This is important as we explore the most common methods of charging-triboelectri charging, also known as charging by friction or rubbing. 3. Who invented the steam engine? 4. What is electron affinity? 5. What is electricity? 6. What is current? 7. What is the unit of power? 8. What is the charge? 9. What is triboelectric charging? 10. How can materials be charged?​</h2><br />

                            10. II. Identify the type of propaganda used or described. Write your answer before the number.Propugedal. This propaganda is all about persuading the target audience to take action. It's about creatingan urge amongst people to become a part of the "in crowd”.2. Maybelline uses the phrase "America's Favorite"?3. It involves the deliberate omission of certain facts to fool the target audience.4. Some companies may cleverly conceal "hidden charges" and only talk about the benefits oftheir products and services.5. The ultimate goal here is to demonstrate how the product is meant for everybody and willprovide value to everyone.6. It is a method commonly used in the world of advertising as the general public has startedgrow skeptical towards paid celebrity endorsements.7. This is popular advertising technique that uses renowned or celebrity figures to endorseproducts and services. Now in this case, when a famous person vouches for something,viewers are likely to take account of the credibility and popularity of that person.8. This establishes trust and boosts the crechbility of that particular brand. Consequently, somebrands may also use figures like doctors and engineers (basically experts) to promote theirproducts and services.9. Glittering generalities is a propaganda technique where propagandists use emotional appealor/and vague statenents to influence the audience.10. Advertising agencies thus use of phrases like as "inspiring you from within" or "to kick-startyour day to create positive anecdotes. This makes the product look more appealing, resultingin better sales11. This type of propaganda uses a completely opposite approach to glittering generalities. As thename suggests, this propaganda technique involves using derogatory phrases to create anegative opinion about someone or some other brand,12. A company that sells plant-based products may talk about how inhumane it is to kill animalsFor this purpose, they may also criticize fast food chains businesses.13. This type of propaganda uses a technique to project certain qualities (this can either bepositive or negative) of a person, ideology or object to other things and people14. Major soft-drink brands were accused of having traces of pesticides a couple of years ago.While these allegations were on the rise, the entire carbonated-drink industry took a hit.During this same period, fruit juices and other drinks were able to do great business.15. It originates from gambling and cars when players try to stack decks in their favor​</h2><br />
