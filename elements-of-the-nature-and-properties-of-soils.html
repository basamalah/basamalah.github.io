                        1. C. Luster - Luster is how a mineral reflects light.<br />2. B. Fracture - Fracture, in mineralogy, appearance of a surface broken in directions other than along cleavage planes.<br />3. A. Cleavage - Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along flat planar surfaces as determined by the structure of its crystal lattice. These two-dimensional surfaces are known as cleavage planes and are caused by the alignment of weaker bonds between atoms in the crystal lattice.<br />4. C. Hardness - Mohs' hardness is a measure of the relative hardness and resistance to scratching between minerals. <br />5. B. Minerals - Minerals and rocks are the essential building blocks of the geosphere.<br />6. D. Streak - Streak is the colour of a mineral in its powdered form. It is usually obtained by rubbing the mineral on a hard, white surface, such as a tile of unglazed porcelain, so as to yield a line, or streak, of fine powder.<br />7. C. Opaque - Most minerals can be characterized and classified by their unique physical properties: hardness, luster, color, streak, specific gravity, cleavage, fracture, and tenacity.<br />8. C. Luster - Luster is how a mineral reflects light.<br />9. C. Mineral - A Mineral is defined as an inorganic, naturally occurring, homogenous solid, with a definite chemical composition, and ordered (crystalline) atomic structures.<br />10. B. Hardness - Hardness is a measure of whether a mineral will scratch or be scratched.<br />11. A. Aragonite - Calcite, dolomite and aragonite are very common in a variety of sedimentary settings and here their formation is often directly or indirectly related to the activity of biological organisms.<br />12. D. Texture - Texture is the description of the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains in a rock.<br />13. C. Organic - A mineral has 5 characteristics; naturally occurring, solid, inorganic, crystalline structure, and the chemical composition. <br />14. A. Cleavage - Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along flat surfaces. The way in which a mineral breaks depends on how its atoms are bonded, or joined together. In a mineral that displays cleavage, the bonds of the crystal structure are weaker in the directions in which the mineral breaks.<br />15. A. Crystal - A crystal is a solid, geometric form of mineral produced by a repeating pattern of atoms that is present throughout the mineral. The shape of a crystal is deter- mined by the arrangement of atoms within the crystal.<br />

<strong>A</strong>. Cleavage is the peeling of the surfaces with weak bonds.
<strong>C</strong>. Hardness is the character of minerals that shows its resistance from scratching.
<strong>B</strong>. Minerals are found in the geosphere.
<strong>D</strong>. Streak is the property of a mineral that shows its color when powdered.
<strong>C</strong>. Opaque is not one of the properties of minerals.
<strong>C</strong>. Luster is the character of a mineral to shine under lights as it reflects it.
<strong>C</strong>. Mineral is an inorganic solid that has compositions from chemicals
<strong>B</strong>. Hardness is the ability of minerals to not dent even when bitten.

Granite<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Minerals are the building blocks of rocks Minerals and rocks are the essential building blocks of the geosphere. Although there are over 3,000 species of minerals, only a few of them, such as quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, pyroxene, olivine and calcite, occur commonly as rock-forming minerals.A Mineral is defined as an inorganic, naturally occurring, homogenous solid, with a definite chemical composition, and ordered (crystalline) atomic structures.Pyrite is sometimes called Fools Gold because of its similarity in color and shape to Gold. In the old mining days, Pyrite was sometimes mistaken for Gold, as they frequently occur together, although Gold and Pyrite can very easily be distinguished by simple observation and testing of characteristics. f a mineral’s structure is equally strong in all directions it will not have any cleavage planes.Minerals are classified on the basis of their chemical composition, which is expressed in their physical properties. This module, the second in a series on minerals, describes the physical properties that are commonly used to identify minerals. These include color, crystal form, hardness, density, luster, and cleavage.hajuyanadoy Coal is a sedimentary rock formed over millions of years from compressed plants. Inorganic detrital rocks, on the other hand, are formed from broken up pieces of other rocks, not from living things. These rocks are often called clastic sedimentary rocks.Sedimentary rocks are formed when sediment  accumulates over time in deposot that form layers. These layers became squeezed  and compressed over time until they consolidate into a rockOver time rocks change from one type to another. One component of the rock cycle is metamorphism, which is a process of changing the mineralogy, texture and chemical composition of rocks by heat, pressure and chemical processes. The resulting type of rock is known as a metamorphic rock. A rock that forms when magma hardens beneath Earth’s surface is called an intrusive igneous rock. Intrusive igneous rocks are types of igneous rocks that are formed when magma crystallizes and solidifies below the earth’s surface to form intrusions.Granite. Granite is a hard igneous rock made of clearly visible crystals of various minerals. Granites are used for buildings and houses, especially in the kitchen and bathroom.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>HOPE IT HELP</strong></p><p><strong>MARK ME AS BRAINLIST</strong></p><p><strong>#CARRY_ON_LEARNING</strong></p><br />
