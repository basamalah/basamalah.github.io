Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

                            25. Average Senior High School annual cost of tuition fee for all private schools last year was ₱46,300. A random sample of costs this year for 45 private schools indicated that the sample mean was ₱47,800 and a sample standard deviation was ₱5,600. At the 0.10 level of significance, is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the cost has increased?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We can use a one-sample t-test to determine if the increase in average tuition fee is statistically significant. Here are the steps:</p><p></p><p>1. State the null and alternative hypotheses:</p><p>- H0: μ = 46,300 (the population mean of the tuition fee is equal to the previous year's average)</p><p>- Ha: μ &gt; 46,300 (the population mean of the tuition fee has increased)</p><p></p><p>2. Set the level of significance: α = 0.10</p><p></p><p>3. Calculate the test statistic:</p><p>- t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)</p><p>- Where x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the hypothesized population mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size</p><p>- t = (47,800 - 46,300) / (5,600 / √45) = 1.9033</p><p></p><p>4. Determine the critical value: </p><p>- To find the critical value, we need to consult a t-distribution table with degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 44 and the desired level of significance (α = 0.10). </p><p>- The critical value for a one-tailed t-test with df = 44 and α = 0.10 is 1.677.</p><p></p><p>5. Compare the test statistic and critical value:</p><p>- Since the test statistic (t = 1.9033) is greater than the critical value (1.677), we can reject the null hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>6. Interpret the result:</p><p>- There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the population mean of the tuition fee has increased from the previous year's average at the 0.10 level of significance.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, we can conclude that the average tuition fee for private senior high schools is significantly higher this year than in the previous year. </p><p></p><p>ILOVE YOU </p><p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Step-by-step explanation:</p><p>To determine if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the cost of tuition fee has increased, we need to perform a hypothesis test. </p><p></p><p>Null Hypothesis (H0): The average tuition fee cost this year is not significantly different from the average tuition fee cost last year, or in other words, there has been no increase in the average tuition fee cost. </p><p></p><p>Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The average tuition fee cost this year is significantly greater than the average tuition fee cost last year, or in other words, there has been an increase in the average tuition fee cost. </p><p></p><p>We can use a one-sample t-test to test this hypothesis, where the sample mean is compared to the population mean. </p><p></p><p>The test statistic can be calculated as: </p><p></p><p>t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / sqrt(n))</p><p></p><p>where x̄ is the sample mean, μ is the population mean from last year, s is the sample standard deviation, and n is the sample size. </p><p></p><p>Plugging in the values given: </p><p></p><p>t = (47,800 - 46,300) / (5,600 / sqrt(45)) = 2.39</p><p></p><p>Using a t-distribution table with 44 degrees of freedom (n-1), the critical value for a one-tailed test with a 0.10 level of significance is 1.645. </p><p></p><p>Since our calculated t-value of 2.39 is greater than the critical value of 1.645, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the average cost of tuition fee has increased this year.</p><br />
