Spending time with our family is important because it helps in creating strong bonds, love, connections, and relationship with them. The time we spend with our family is something money cannot buy and replace. 2. It is essential to protect and maintain the beauty of the habitat of our sea creatures Protecting it will make them live peacefully and freely in the water.

His uncle Juanito wrote him to come to Manila, "I want you to come and help me in my furniture shop," he wrote. "I'm sending you your train fare. Call me when you leave. I'll meet you at the station." So one bright day, Petros took a bus for the nearest town. He had taken a bus a few times before. But he never enjoyed any of those trips because the bus was to crowded for comfort. He did not mind any discomfort on that day, for he was at last going to Manila, the city of his dreamsl Petros had to wait at the station for more than three hours. He had lunch and a short nap when the train finally arrived. How wonderful his trip was! He wondered at the speed it took the train to reach the city. He wondered at the varied things he saw on the way. After he had satisfied his thirst foe new things, he told himself, "There's nothing more exciting than leaving ono's barrio for the great big city."

MAKE IT NEAT AND COLORFUL. A DREAM TRIP Petros had lived in the barrio all his life before his uncle's invitation came. His uncle Juanito wrote him to come to Manila. "I want you to come and help me in my furniture shop," he wrote. "I'm sending you your train fare. Call me when you leave. I'll meet you at the station." So one bright day, Petros took a bus for the nearest town. He had taken a bus a few times before. But he never enjoyed any of those trips because the bus was to crowded for comfort. He did not mind any discomfort on that day, for he was at last going to Manila, the city of his dreams! Petros had to wait at the station for more than three hours. He had lunch and a short nap when the train finally arrived. How wonderful his trip was! He wondered at the speed it took the train to reach the city. He wondered at the varied things he saw on the way. After he had satisfied his thirst foe new things, he told himself, "There's nothing more exciting than leaving one's barrio for the great big city."

(10 points) According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an estimated 78 million dogs are owned as pets in the United States. It is unclear when dogs were first domesticated, but a study published last year claims that, at least in Europe, dogs were tamed 20,000–40,000 years ago. It is likely that humans and dogs have shared a special bond of friendship and mutual support ever since at least the Neolithic period - but why has this bond been so long- lasting? Of course, these cousins of the wolves have historically been great at keeping us and our dwellings safe, guarding our houses, our cattle, and our various material goods. Throughout history, humans have also trained dogs to assist them with hunting, or they have bred numerous quirky- looking species for their cuteness or elegance. However, dogs are also - and might have always been - truly valued companions, famed for their loyalty and seemingly constant willingness to put a smile on their owners' faces. Fact Opinion​</a>

No one used to get down at the station and nothing happened there.Until one day he sees a girl selling fruit and he is unable to forget her.What Is Great About It: Ruskin Bond is a writer who can communicate deep feelings in a simple way.This story is about our attachment to strangers and why we cherish (value or appreciate deeply) them even though we do not meet them ever again.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> "The Night Train at Deoli" by Ruskin Bond. One potential critique of the story could be its lack of plot development. While the story effectively captures the essence of a young man's infatuation with a girl he encounters on a train, it fails to offer a deeper exploration of the characters or their motivations beyond surface-level observations. Additionally, some may argue that the story relies too much on nostalgia and romanticization of a bygone era, which may not resonate with modern readers who are looking for more nuanced and complex narratives. Overall, while "The Night Train at Deoli" is a poignant and evocative story, it could benefit from additional character development and a more robust plot.</p><p></p><br />

MAKE IT NEAT AND COLORFUL. A DREAM TRIP Petros had lived in the barrio all his life before his uncle's invitation came. His uncle Juanito wrote him to come to Manila. "I want you to come and help me in my furniture shop," he wrote. "I'm sending you your train fare. Call me when you leave. I'll meet you at the station." So one bright day, Petros took a bus for the nearest town. He had taken a bus a few times before. But he never enjoyed any of those trips because the bus was to crowded for comfort. He did not mind any discomfort on that day, for he was at last going to Manila, the city of his dreams! Petros had to wait at the station for more than three hours. He had lunch and a short nap when the train finally arrived. How wonderful his trip was! He wondered at the speed it took the train to reach the city. He wondered at the varied things he saw on the way. After he had satisfied his thirst foe new things, he told himself, "There's nothing more exciting than leaving one's barrio for the great big city."

                            30. Part 3 Fact and Opinion Direction: Read the following article below and distinguish the fact and opinion using the f chart below. (10 points) According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an estimated 78 million dogs are owned as pets in the United States. It is unclear when dogs were first domesticated, but a study published last year claims that, at least in Europe, dogs were tamed 20,000–40,000 years ago. It is likely that humans and dogs have shared a special bond of friendship and mutual support ever since at least the Neolithic period - but why has this bond been so long- lasting? Of course, these cousins of the wolves have historically been great at keeping us and our dwellings safe, guarding our houses, our cattle, and our various material goods. Throughout history, humans have also trained dogs to assist them with hunting, or they have bred numerous quirky- looking species for their cuteness or elegance. However, dogs are also - and might have always been - truly valued companions, famed for their loyalty and seemingly constant willingness to put a smile on their owners' faces.
