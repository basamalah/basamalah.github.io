According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), parents, teachers and health professionals need to be aware of the serious health effects associated with a high intake of soft drinks in schools. The consumption of such drinks has increased dramatically in the last two decades. Recent figures from the World Health Organization stated that over 60% of Irish children consume one can (330ml) of soft drink every 24 hours. "Each can of sweetened soft drink contains the equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar and 150 calories and is associated with a 60% increased risk of obesity. In addition to the extra calories, soft drinks pose a major risk of dental caries (cavities) because of their sugar content and of enamel erosion because of their acidity", said Dr Lean O'Flaherty of the National Dairy Council.​</a>

Text A Mario stood calmly by the door of the principal's office while waiting for his teacher. He looked farther to check on his adviser if she would be coming because she was nowhere. After a few minutes, a spectacle man was in sight it was the school principal. Mario told the principal about the purpose of his visit. He made his statement clear why he brought his cell phone to school. He told the principal that his classmates shouted at him to their classroom, telling him that bringing cellphone was not allowed. He felt weak explaining his reason for doing it. He told the principal that it hurt him to have violated a school policy but doing this made him feel secure to text or call up his sick mother at home. He told the principal that he was sorry for doing it, but it hurt him because his purpose was concern of his sick mother. The principal patted the apologetic pupil on the shoulder and spoke kindly to him. Text B While waiting for his adviser to come, Mario visited the principal's office. His purpose was to explain why he had brought his cell phone in class. Earlier, his classmates noisily reminded him that bringing cell phone in school was not allowed. Nevertheless, Mario told the principal that it hurt him to violate the school policy but he had to do it. Mario said that he felt secure to text or call his sick mother. The principal just patted the apologetic pupil and spoke to him kindly. How is Test A different from Text B? Text B is the summary of Text A, which is the original text?

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), parents, teachers and health professionals need to be aware of the serious health effects associated with a high intake of soft drinks in schools. The consumption of such drinks has increased dramatically in the last two decades. Recent figures from the World Health Organization stated that over 60% of Irish children consume one can (330ml) of soft drink every 24 hours. "Each can of sweetened soft drink contains the equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar and 150 calories and is associated with a 60% increased risk of obesity. In addition to the extra calories, soft drinks pose a major risk of dental caries (cavities) because of their sugar content and of enamel erosion because of their acidity", said Dr Lean O'Flaherty of the National Dairy Council.​</a>

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), parents, teachers and health professionals need to be aware of the serious health effects associated with a high intake of soft drinks in schools. The consumption of such drinks has increased dramatically in the last two decades. Recent figures from the World Health Organization stated that over 60% of Irish children consume one can (330ml) of soft drink every 24 hours. "Each can of sweetened soft drink contains the equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar and 150 calories and is associated with a 60% increased risk of obesity. In addition to the extra calories, soft drinks pose a major risk of dental caries (cavities) because of their sugar content and of enamel erosion because of their acidity", said Dr Lean O'Flaherty of the National Dairy Council.​</h2><br />

After a few minutes, a spectacle man was in sight it was the school principal. Mario told the principal about the purpose of his visit. He made his statement clear why he brought his cell phone to school. He told the principal that his classmates shouted at him to their classroom, telling him that bringing cellphone was not allowed. He felt weak explaining his reason for doing it. He told the principal that it hurt him to have violated a school policy but doing this made him feel secure to text or call up his sick mother at home. He told the principal that he was sorry for doing it, but it hurt him because his purpose was concern of his sick mother. The principal patted the apologetic pupil on the shoulder and spoke kindly to him. Text B While waiting for his adviser to come, Mario visited the principal's office. His purpose was to explain why he had brought his cell phone in class. Earlier, his classmates noisily reminded him that bringing cell phone in school was not allowed.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), parents, teachers and health professionals need to be aware of the serious health effects associated with a high intake of soft drinks in schools. The consumption of such drinks has increased dramatically in the last two decades. Recent figures from the World Health Organization stated that over 60% of Irish children consume one can (330ml) of soft drink every 24 hours. "Each can of sweetened soft drink contains the equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar and 150 calories and is associated with a 60% increased risk of obesity. In addition to the extra calories, soft drinks pose a major risk of dental caries (cavities) because of their sugar content and of enamel erosion because of their acidity", said Dr Lean O'Flaherty of the National Dairy Council.​</h2><br />
