The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

The migrant laborers mayleave their families and live temporarily in another country, thus disrupting the familyand social fabric of their home communities. Furthermore, most of their earnings may besent home, reducing the benefits their employment could have in the country where theyare employed. Often foreign workers immigrate to another country and, because theylive in their own neighborhoods, continue to follow their religions, customs, and evenfollow their own laws, they are sometimes accused of not being willing to adapt andaccept their new country. On the other hand, often these newcomers complain that theyare poorly treated and cannot live the way they would like in the more developedcountries they have immigrated to. Many developing countries need new industries andthe jobs these industries bring to improve their economies through globalization, but theydo not want to lose their own culture and identity in the process. Many developingcountries fear that increased globalization may lead to loss of control over economic andpolitical decisions and may also threaten their traditions, language, and culture. Withthe predominance of American pop culture as well as political and economic influencearound the world, many developing countries see globalization as a form of"Americanization" or "Westernization that is undermining the fabric of their traditionalsocieties. In addition, many developing countries do not have stringent rules aboutenvironmental protection, thus, industries do not need expensive pollution controlequipment, resulting in serious air, water, and soil pollution that would not beacceptable.Commentary: ​</h2><br />

Your work will be judged using a rubric below.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Globalization has brought significant changes to our daily lives, from the foods we eat to the clothes we wear and the way we interact with people from different cultures. It has created opportunities for individuals and businesses to connect and trade on a global scale. However, it has also led to cultural homogenization and the loss of unique identities.</p><p></p><p>The collage activity is an excellent way to visualize and reflect on how globalization affects our lives. The images selected can be related to food, fashion, media, technology, and other areas influenced by globalization. The collage can also include pictures of people from different cultures to showcase the diversity brought about by globalization.</p><p></p><p>The brief explanation accompanying the collage should highlight both the positive and negative effects of globalization. It is important to acknowledge the opportunities it has created while also recognizing the challenges it poses to cultural identities and local economies. Ultimately, whether we continue to adapt to globalization or maintain our identity as one nation is a complex and ongoing debate. Finding a balance between embracing global connections and preserving cultural diversity is crucial.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the collage activity and the accompanying explanation can help individuals gain a better understanding of how globalization affects their lives and the world around them. It is an opportunity to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of globalization and to consider how we can shape its future impact.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
