We are met on a great bat-tle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of free-dom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.​</a>

Locate and read the poem "Third World Geography" by Cirilo F. Bautista. 
Based on the poem, we looked at how Philippine writing remains engaged with the idea of oppression and how significant part of Philippine history remains clear in the psyche of Filipinos today. But is this the only form of the oppression we have ever faced?
Try these tasks:
What are the instances of oppression happening now? Cut out news clippings of these and present the collage that shows oppression through digital presentation. You may also use illustrations or photographs to present other instances of oppression you have found happening in the world.</a>

Rising in the east.
But it only took one moment,
Just one moment.
Now we got battle scars,
And freedom feels so far,
Away!
Tyranny was meant to be,
All that remains is an unfinished symphony.
He was so in love with chaos, I could never see.
Good things don't happen to heroes, just like you and me.
It only took one moment,
Just one moment.
These adventures are a gift,
And we will never drift
Away!
The thing I built this nation for,
Doesn't exist anymore.
Gone away.
It only took one moment,
Just one moment.
Our life and liberty,
And pursuit of victory gone,
Away!</a>

When I was a child, I used to stay there for a long time together with my cousins. There we play some of our traditional games such as Tumbang Preso, Agawan Base, Hide and Seek and other games. We enjoy it so much and it made our vacation so much memories to remember. These memories will remain in our hearts forever. Now that I am growing older, I wish I could go back to those happy memories that we've been in our childhood. Pronouns:___________Point of View:_____________.</a>

If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothingLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes and perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease, where there are tongues, they will be stilled, where there is knowledge, it will pass away.For we know in part and we prophesy in part but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I like a became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror, then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.​</a>

                                            What's More Now, let's take our discussion a notch higher here. You see, non-linear text is not only about graphs and flow charts where large data are summarized into tables together with its variables. In fact, the most commonly used example of non-linear texts nowadays also include pictures and clip arts. These are what we now call pictographs or infographics which are usually found in information drives. To help you understand this better, more activities are coming your way. So brace yourself and have fun going over the remaining part of this module! 6 to 10​</a>

And so all the stardust gather together,
called upon, waking after one hundred years
The men face onwards,
onto a journey to overcome the sands of time
Stretching out like a chain, karma becomes intertwined:
a destiny to end it all with platinum light
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
What I’ll fire off are-
All right now! All right now! All right now!
-bullets of my pride! (JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!)
Break you down! Break you down! Break you down!
This sacred vision, firing its fists, stand proud!
During this sealed “time”
who will be the one to pour the light?
The hope remaining in the future
is in the shooting star crusaders
We’re gambling for the life and the love we must protect,
and the tarot cards have been dealt
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
Stand in the way
All right now! All right now! All right now!
Overthrow your foe!
Break you down! Break you down! Break you down!
This vision of my soul, open the doors and stand proud!
The men search and pursue after his back,
as he sneers within the darkness
The requiem of their footsteps,
resonates in the desert…
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
What I’ll fire off are-
All right now! All right now! All right now!

Break you down! Break you down! Break you down!

                            17. Activity 1: The Third World Geography
Locate and read the poem "Third World Geography" by Cirilo F. Bautista. 
Based on the poem, we looked at how Philippine writing remains engaged with the idea of oppression and how significant part of Philippine history remains clear in the psyche of Filipinos today. But is this the only form of the oppression we have ever faced?
Try these tasks:
What are the instances of oppression happening now? Cut out news clippings of these and present the collage that shows oppression through digital presentation. You may also use illustrations or photographs to present other instances of oppression you have found happening in the world.</h2><br />

Just one moment.
Now we got battle scars,
And freedom feels so far,
Away!

All that remains is an unfinished symphony.
He was so in love with chaos, I could never see.
Good things don't happen to heroes, just like you and me.
It only took one moment,
Just one moment.
These adventures are a gift,
And we will never drift
Away!
The thing I built this nation for,
Doesn't exist anymore.
Gone away.
It only took one moment,
Just one moment.
Our life and liberty,
And pursuit of victory gone,
Away!</h2><br />

                            25. Read the reading material about love below, then write a one-paragraph synthesis. Be guided by the following rubric: (15 points) 1 Corinthians 13 If I speak tin the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all the mysteries and all knowledge, and I have faith that can move mountains but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothingLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes and perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease, where there are tongues, they will be stilled, where there is knowledge, it will pass away.For we know in part and we prophesy in part but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I like a became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror, then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.​</h2><br />

called upon, waking after one hundred years
The men face onwards,
onto a journey to overcome the sands of time
Stretching out like a chain, karma becomes intertwined:
a destiny to end it all with platinum light
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
What I’ll fire off are-
All right now! All right now! All right now!

Break you down! Break you down! Break you down!
This sacred vision, firing its fists, stand proud!
During this sealed “time”
who will be the one to pour the light?
The hope remaining in the future
is in the shooting star crusaders
We’re gambling for the life and the love we must protect,
and the tarot cards have been dealt
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
Stand in the way
All right now! All right now! All right now!
Overthrow your foe!
Break you down! Break you down! Break you down!
This vision of my soul, open the doors and stand proud!

as he sneers within the darkness
The requiem of their footsteps,
resonates in the desert…
