Write the underlined words on your answer sheet. I am utterly fond of my lola's house. Its design is absolutely perfect inside and out, and I feel absolutely at home when I'm visiting. The exterior of the house is built entirely of stone. My favorite part of the house is the sunroom. The sunroom is rather cold in the winter, but in spring and fall it is simply divine. I really love sitting in the sunroom with my brothers and sisters and a hot cup of milk. The newly renovated kitchen is also a very splendid place to visit with the family. The kitchen has been under construction for quite some time, but by the looks of things, it seems to be nearly finished. This house would cost much more in the city, but because it's located in a small town, it was pretty reasonable.​</a>

The exterior of the house isbuilt entirely of stone. My favorite part of the house is the sunroom. The sunroomis rather cold in the winter, but in spring and fall it is simply divine. I really love sittingin the sunroom with my brothers and sisters and a hot cup of milk. The newlyrenovated kitchen is also a very splendid place to visit with the family. The kitchenhas been under construction for quite some time, but by the looks of things, it seemsto be nearly finished. This house would cost much more in the city, but because it'slocated in a small town, it was pretty reasonable.​</a>
