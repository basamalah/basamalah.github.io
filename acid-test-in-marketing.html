                                            Description of the process1. the insertion of a single gene which downregulates the activity ofthe onion enzyme that makes your eyes water has managed toachieve two things: firstly, onions no longer make your eyes water2. they performed a study where such carrots were tested on miceand 30 volunteers, and the results showed that humans absorbed42% more calcium from the modified carrots than from regularones. The aim of this test was to help prevent osteoporosis, whilethe emphasis was on its bioavailability in target tissues3. This kind of oil has high stability during baking, meaning it doesnot need to go through the chemical process of hydrogenation,which produces unwanted trans fats. There is a similar vascular-system-friendly oil marketed by Monsanto with two inserted genesenabling the production of omega-3 fatty acids.4. This is a small invasive species, and we know a great deal aboutits genes. This little plant helps us understand the hereditary natureof numerous plant characteristics relating to: drought, low nitrogenrequirements5. The aim of this research is to prevent the most popular cultivarsfrom turning brown. The same principle applies to these apples as tothe previously mentioned onions: it is not about adding genes butabout downregulating the activity of the existing ones6. a study describing how they had transferred a gene from adecorative plant into a tomato, which enabled the productionof anthocyanin, making the tomato dark blue. They later tested it onmice, and discovered that it prevents them from getting cancer7. The lack of this vitamin is especially harmful to the poorest and isestimated to cause blindness. Because of its colour, the product wasfirst given the name golden rice, which remains the same to this day8. Scientists have successfully used a genetic modification, insertinga pepper gene into bananas, which prevents the fruit from gettingthe disease.9. Frost-resistant eucalyptus trees are already being produced andused in the paper industry. As for the leading crops, species thatsuccessfully grow with smaller doses of nitrogen and phosphorusare already being tested10. This includes modification of species resistant to harmfulinsects, where new species allow up to 80% less spraying.​</a>

                            5. Description of the process1. the insertion of a single gene which downregulates the activity ofthe onion enzyme that makes your eyes water has managed toachieve two things: firstly, onions no longer make your eyes water2. they performed a study where such carrots were tested on miceand 30 volunteers, and the results showed that humans absorbed42% more calcium from the modified carrots than from regularones. The aim of this test was to help prevent osteoporosis, whilethe emphasis was on its bioavailability in target tissues3. This kind of oil has high stability during baking, meaning it doesnot need to go through the chemical process of hydrogenation,which produces unwanted trans fats. There is a similar vascular-system-friendly oil marketed by Monsanto with two inserted genesenabling the production of omega-3 fatty acids.4. This is a small invasive species, and we know a great deal aboutits genes. This little plant helps us understand the hereditary natureof numerous plant characteristics relating to: drought, low nitrogenrequirements5. The aim of this research is to prevent the most popular cultivarsfrom turning brown. The same principle applies to these apples as tothe previously mentioned onions: it is not about adding genes butabout downregulating the activity of the existing ones6. a study describing how they had transferred a gene from adecorative plant into a tomato, which enabled the productionof anthocyanin, making the tomato dark blue. They later tested it onmice, and discovered that it prevents them from getting cancer7. The lack of this vitamin is especially harmful to the poorest and isestimated to cause blindness. Because of its colour, the product wasfirst given the name golden rice, which remains the same to this day8. Scientists have successfully used a genetic modification, insertinga pepper gene into bananas, which prevents the fruit from gettingthe disease.9. Frost-resistant eucalyptus trees are already being produced andused in the paper industry. As for the leading crops, species thatsuccessfully grow with smaller doses of nitrogen and phosphorusare already being tested10. This includes modification of species resistant to harmfulinsects, where new species allow up to 80% less spraying.​</h2><br />
