                                            Read the text and answer the questions that follow.Which one is better, a book or a movie? Some argue that one is better than the other, but it is still subject to debate. Both are good sources of entertainment and information, but because movies are shortened versions of books, some important details might not be included. Watching a movie will only take about two to three hours, while it will probably take you days before you can finish a whole book. Books can still be appealing to read even after 20 years. On the one hand, movies lose their appeal over time because of technological changes and advancements. However, movies are more visually appealing than books, but if it's the story you are after, both are on the same level. When you read books, you become more of a part of them; whereas you tend to be more passive when you watch movies. Compared with movies, books engage your imagination by letting you picture the characters’ faces, characters’ voices, and places. In conclusion, although books and movies share some similarities, it is apparent that readers have more to offer.Guide Questions:1. How did the writer introduce the main idea?2.

On this age of technology, sources of information include both print and non-print materials. You have the choice which to use, so you should know how these materials are different from one another. Print materials refer to all paper publications in printed form. Examples of these are published books, journals, magazines, newspaper, dictionaries and encyclopedias all these you can hold and grab. You can scan through their pages and read the contents conveniently. It is said that they are reliable and affordable for most people who valued these resources. On the other hand, non-print materials are those that have special formats.

                            4. Read the text and answer the questions that follow.Which one is better, a book or a movie? Some argue that one is better than the other, but it is still subject to debate. Both are good sources of entertainment and information, but because movies are shortened versions of books, some important details might not be included. Watching a movie will only take about two to three hours, while it will probably take you days before you can finish a whole book. Books can still be appealing to read even after 20 years. On the one hand, movies lose their appeal over time because of technological changes and advancements. However, movies are more visually appealing than books, but if it's the story you are after, both are on the same level. When you read books, you become more of a part of them; whereas you tend to be more passive when you watch movies. Compared with movies, books engage your imagination by letting you picture the characters’ faces, characters’ voices, and places. In conclusion, although books and movies share some similarities, it is apparent that readers have more to offer.Guide Questions:1. How did the writer introduce the main idea?2.

On this age of technology, sources of information include both print and non-print materials. You have the choice which to use, so you should know how these materials are different from one another. Print materials refer to all paper publications in printed form. Examples of these are published books, journals, magazines, newspaper, dictionaries and encyclopedias all these you can hold and grab. You can scan through their pages and read the contents conveniently. It is said that they are reliable and affordable for most people who valued these resources. On the other hand, non-print materials are those that have special formats.

Examples of these materials are e-books, e-journals, e-photographs, compact disc, records, slides, videos and films. These can relay information faster.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>This article explains the difference between print and non-print materials as sources of information. Print materials are physical publications such as books, magazines, and newspapers that can be held and read at one's convenience. They are considered reliable and affordable. Non-print materials, on the other hand, are accessed through digital equipment such as computers, tablets, and phones. Examples of non-print materials include e-books, videos, and photographs. Non-print materials are faster in relaying information but require machines to access them.</strong></p><p></p><br />
