Text 1: Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation: conceived in liberty, dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war ... testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated ... can long endure. We are met on a gret battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

A Successful Fallure (by Glenn Frank) Several years ago, there appeared a series of papers that purported to be confessions of a succesful man who was under no delusion as to the essential quality of his attainments. The papers are not before me as I write, and I must trust to memory and a few penciled notes made at the time of their appearance, but it will be interesting to recall his confessions regarding his education. T think they paint a fairy faithful picture of the mind of the averge college graduate. He stated that he came from a family that prided itself on its culture and intellectuality and that had always been a family of professional folk. His grandfather was a clergyman; among his uncles were a lawyer, a physician and a professor, his sisters married professional men. He received a fairly good primry and secondary education, and was graduated from his university with honors. He was, he stated, of a distinctly literary turn of mind, and during his four years at college imblbed some slight information concerning the English classics as well as modern history and metaphysics, so that he could talk quite glibly about Chaucer, Beaumont and Fletcher, Thomas Love Peacock, and Ann Radcliffe, and speak with apparent familiarity about Kant and Schopenhauer.

I Have a Dream (by Martin Luther King, Jr.) I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Flve score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering Injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity Source: https://www.americenchgtorls.com/spe nihaveadream.htm​</a>

Strong family ties and relationshipwas built - even Tiktok videos arewell-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment issmoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted for amonth of locked down; most people cultivated the landeven pots and plasticcontainers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled - mostlearned how to follow rules an seed how to wait and giveturns to others. Diligence inearning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. HealthWas even worth thepricel - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetablesalways.Education had never stopped upon finding means - different learningmodalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered - givingand sharing were evident; andmost especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone isincluded. And that's for our good to keep us safe fromharm and to stay alive.As I raised my head, I know that this is just a testof time. A period of everyone's life to be resilient, cared,hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic willend the soonest and everything will just be a part of thehistory of human life.​what are the possible cause and effect in this story and possible solution</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The explanation provided is not a complete sentence, but it describes a psychological phenomenon known as the Fundamental Attribution Error. This error occurs when individuals tend to overemphasize dispositional explanations (internal factors) for the behavior of others while ignoring situational explanations (external factors). This means that people often attribute other people's actions to their character or personality traits rather than considering external circumstances that may have contributed to their behavior. For example, if someone is consistently late for work, a colleague may assume that they are lazy or lack punctuality, without considering that they may be dealing with unforeseen circumstances such as transportation issues or family problems.</p><br />

Text 1: Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation: conceived in liberty, dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war ... testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated ... can long endure. We are met on a gret battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

A Successful Fallure (by Glenn Frank) Several years ago, there appeared a series of papers that purported to be confessions of a succesful man who was under no delusion as to the essential quality of his attainments. The papers are not before me as I write, and I must trust to memory and a few penciled notes made at the time of their appearance, but it will be interesting to recall his confessions regarding his education. T think they paint a fairy faithful picture of the mind of the averge college graduate. He stated that he came from a family that prided itself on its culture and intellectuality and that had always been a family of professional folk. His grandfather was a clergyman; among his uncles were a lawyer, a physician and a professor, his sisters married professional men. He received a fairly good primry and secondary education, and was graduated from his university with honors. He was, he stated, of a distinctly literary turn of mind, and during his four years at college imblbed some slight information concerning the English classics as well as modern history and metaphysics, so that he could talk quite glibly about Chaucer, Beaumont and Fletcher, Thomas Love Peacock, and Ann Radcliffe, and speak with apparent familiarity about Kant and Schopenhauer.

I Have a Dream (by Martin Luther King, Jr.) I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Flve score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering Injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity Source: https://www.americenchgtorls.com/spe nihaveadream.htm​</h2><br />

                            9. But in some way or another, the pandemic which caused sudden fallures anddisappointments in life and labor transforms the ordinary into an extraordinary renewalof what was lost. Strong family ties and relationshipwas built - even Tiktok videos arewell-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment issmoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted for amonth of locked down; most people cultivated the landeven pots and plasticcontainers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled - mostlearned how to follow rules an seed how to wait and giveturns to others. Diligence inearning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. HealthWas even worth thepricel - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetablesalways.Education had never stopped upon finding means - different learningmodalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered - givingand sharing were evident; andmost especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone isincluded. And that's for our good to keep us safe fromharm and to stay alive.As I raised my head, I know that this is just a testof time. A period of everyone's life to be resilient, cared,hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic willend the soonest and everything will just be a part of thehistory of human life.​what are the possible cause and effect in this story and possible solution</h2><br />
                        <p>Cause - The animal influenza viruses such as SARS and Covid-19 that has emerges.  </p><p>Effect - it spreads all over the world to humans and animals which causes death. Everyone was been forced to just stay in their respective homes (quarantine) especially children and senior citizens that is more prone in virus. Because of quarantine, as the story says, strong family ties were built,the environment was smoothly recovering from pollution and breakage - pollution temporarily halted because of a month of lock down, Students were being taught through online or modules, and most importantly our faith and trust in God were restored.</p><p>Possible solution - Possible solution is to follow the rules that must be follow to prevent the spread of the virus like always wash hands, always drink water, take vitamins, eat proper foods, don't go outside if there is no important walk, always use mask and face shield when in the outside, social distance to people, and clean the surroundings. If You were exposed like  frontliners from their patients that is positive or when you are experiencing the symptoms, you have to do the 14 days quarantine rule or if possible go to the hospital if you cant handle it anymore. We also need to support each other and help others that are in need. We have to work together to fight the pandemic that was happening. Most importantly Prayers and Faith with God and Jesus Christ His Son.</p><br />
