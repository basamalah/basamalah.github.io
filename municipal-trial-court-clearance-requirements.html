                            6. Why is the Philippine Court divided into review courts and trial courts?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Exclusive original jurisdiction is determined by the subject matter and the nature or amount, or both, of the claim. The judiciary is independent and co-equal with the legislative and executive branches. Members of the Supreme Court and judges of lower courts are appointed by the President. Courts of equal and coordinate jurisdiction cannot interfere with each other’s orders and cannot review each other's actions and decisions.  There is no jury system in the Philippines. The Judiciary of the Philippines consists of the Supreme Court, which is established in the Constitution, and three levels of lower courts, which are established through law by the Congress of the Philippines. The Supreme Court has expansive powers, able to overrule political and administrative decisions, and with the ability to craft rules and law without precedent. It further determines the rules of procedure for lower courts, and its members sit on electoral tribunals.
</p><p>
</p><p>Below the Supreme Court is the Court of Appeals, which also has national scope with different divisions based in different regions of the country. Decisions from this court can only be appealed to the Supreme Court. Below this level are Regional Trial Courts, which are spread throughout the country among judicial regions. Some of these courts are specialized to deal with certain types of cases. Below these courts are the first level Metropolitan and Municipal Trial Courts, which are located in cities and municipalities throughout the country.</p><br />
