                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Filipino language is an essential part of our identity as Filipinos. It is the language that binds us together and connects us to our rich cultural heritage. However, the Filipino language is in danger of being lost. The prevalence of English, the rise of Taglish, and the increasing use of foreign languages are slowly eroding our native tongue.</p><p></p><p>It is crucial to save the Filipino language, not only because it is our national language, but also because it reflects our culture and history. The language is a repository of our shared experiences as a people, from the pre-colonial era to the present day. It embodies our values, beliefs, and traditions, and it serves as a bridge between generations.</p><p></p><p>The loss of the Filipino language would also mean the loss of our cultural diversity. The Philippines is home to over 180 languages and dialects, each with its unique characteristics and nuances. The Filipino language acts as a unifying force that allows us to appreciate and celebrate our diverse cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Filipino language is crucial for national development. It is the language of instruction in our schools, and it is the language used in our government, media, and business sectors. Without a strong command of the Filipino language, we limit our ability to communicate effectively with each other and with the rest of the world.</p><p></p><p>To save the Filipino language, we must start by valuing and promoting it. We must use it in our daily lives and encourage others to do the same. We must also invest in programs that promote the use of the language, such as language immersion programs, cultural festivals, and language classes.</p><p></p><p>It is also important to recognize the role of the Filipino language in shaping our national identity. We must embrace our linguistic diversity and recognize the importance of preserving our regional languages and dialects.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> enjoy   </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Filipino language is an essential part of our cultural identity as a nation. It is the language that unites us as a people, and it is our means of communication with each other and the rest of the world. However, in recent years, there has been a decline in the use of Filipino, especially among the younger generation. This is a cause for concern, as it threatens to erode our cultural heritage and diminish our sense of national identity.</p><p></p><p>There are several reasons why the Filipino language is in danger of being lost. One of the main reasons is the increasing influence of Western culture, which has led to the widespread use of English and other foreign languages in everyday life. Another reason is the lack of emphasis on the teaching of Filipino in schools, with some schools even opting to use English as the medium of instruction.</p><p></p><p>To save the Filipino language, we must take action to promote its use and importance. One way we can do this is by using Filipino in our daily conversations and interactions, especially in our homes and communities. We can also encourage the use of Filipino in media and entertainment, such as in movies, TV shows, and music.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, schools and educational institutions should give more importance to the teaching of Filipino. This includes not only teaching the language as a subject, but also using it as the medium of instruction in various subjects. This will help students appreciate the importance of the language and its relevance to our culture and history.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the Filipino language is a vital part of our cultural identity, and we must take action to preserve and promote its use. By using Filipino in our daily lives, promoting it in media and entertainment, and emphasizing its importance in schools, we can ensure that future generations will continue to value and appreciate our rich cultural heritage. Let us all do our part in saving the Filipino language.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Yan po Yung sagot</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>PLIANT LIKE THE BAMBOO
</p><p>
</p><p>1. The two trees compared in the essay are the mango tree and the bamboo tree.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Filipinos are likened to the bamboo tree. According to the essay, it is said so because like how the bamboo tree bent and just went where the wind was blowing to avoid destruction, we Filipinos have been through the same. It was when we were colonized by the Spaniards, then the Japanese and the Americans before we were able to have our freedom.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. For more than 300 years that the Spaniards have colonized us, they brought in a lot of change in our culture and history. Some of which are like our religion, our language, education, etc.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. During the Japanese regime, Filipinos were illustrated to be "like a plague of locusts" wherein our ancestors didn't have a choice but to bow down and obey to their orders.  </p><p>
</p><p>5. It can be said the Americans were the most gentle among the tree. At least with them, we sort of had our own choices and not so strict rules.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. Filipinos have this strong cultural and family bond. We do not live alone in this world, and we make sure that we feel that through our undeniably strong family ties.
</p><p>
</p><p>7. Filipinos were often accused of being indolent and someone who lacks initiative.
</p><p>
</p><p>8. In the essay, it was answered in such a creative way which I think means no one who lives under direct sun, as a tropical country, would not feel laziness and initiative at times.
</p><p>
</p><p>9. Filipinos are all dreamers because of what we have experienced from the past. We all did learn from it and from then, we never stopped dreaming.
</p><p>
</p><p>10. Since the Philippines was colonized by the Spaniards, Japanese and American we can fluently, if not fluent, at least speak our own mother language, English and a bit of Spanish especially we have a lot of similar words.

Life during Enhance Community Quarantine3. Being a student in times of Covid-19​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Being a student in times of Covid-19</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Being a student is already difficult in normal times... Most of us attempt to juggle studying, earning a livelihood, gaining early job experience (e.g. internships), and attending one or more student parties (obviously for networking). Being a student amid a worldwide epidemic is terrifying, to say the least.</p><p>Let me preface this by saying that living and studying in Germany is already something many (young) people want to, and Germany definitely handled Covid-19 admirably, so every issue detailed below may be interpreted as moaning about first-world difficulties. Nonetheless, Germany's universities, or more broadly, its educational system, are not widely renowned for being leaders in digitalized learning. Some institutes are faring better than others, either because they previously placed a greater emphasis on offering digitalized learning and testing services, or because they swiftly adapted to it.</p><p>Without a doubt, no one could have predicted a worldwide catastrophe, and it is always simpler to point out what could have been done better in retrospect than it is during times of uncertainty and the urgent need to act. So, rather than throwing accusations and blame about, which is a) pointless and b) something I am not in a position to do anyhow, let's focus on what can be done to alleviate some circumstances. Moving to digitalized educational offers has many advantages, but the quick changes necessitated by Covid-19 have also resulted in certain difficulties that could have been avoided with more time and a more stable economic and social context.As a result, I'd want to look at some issues that have arisen for students in recent months and provide some examples of how to cope with them.</p><br />

appreciation of the Filipino language</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Filipino language, also known as Tagalog, is a language spoken by millions of people in the Philippines and around the world. It is the official language of the Philippines, and it plays a vital role in the country's culture and history. The appreciation of the Filipino language is essential to understanding and preserving the Philippines' unique identity.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant aspects of the Filipino language is its ability to convey emotions and feelings. The language is rich in idiomatic expressions and metaphors, which are used to express complex ideas and emotions in a simple and concise manner. For example, the phrase "pusong lumuluha" (heart that is crying) is used to describe someone who is deeply in love. This simple phrase is able to convey the depth of emotion that is felt by the person in question, and it is a testament to the power of the Filipino language to capture the nuances of human experience.</p><p></p><p>The Filipino language is also closely tied to the country's history and culture. It has undergone many changes throughout the centuries, and it has been influenced by a variety of other languages, including Malay, Spanish, and English. This has led to a language that is unique and distinct, and it reflects the diverse and multicultural society that is the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Filipino language is an essential tool for communication and understanding between different ethnic groups in the Philippines. The Philippines is home to a large number of indigenous languages, and Tagalog is widely spoken and understood by many of the different ethnic groups in the country. This allows for better communication and understanding between different cultures, which is crucial for building a strong and united nation.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the appreciation of the Filipino language is essential to understanding and preserving the Philippines' unique identity. It is a powerful tool for communication and expression, and it reflects the country's rich history and culture. It is also an important tool for building understanding and unity between different ethnic groups, which is vital for the country's growth and development. Therefore, it is important to promote and preserve the Filipino language, as it is a vital part of the Philippines' heritage and future.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It's a part of who we are as a people</p><p>As a Filipino, our language is inextricably connected to who we are as a people. A majority of the population know how to speak Filipino, so it's a way for us as a people to be united, especially during these days. The Filipino language is the spirit of the national identity.</p><br />

                        <p>The United States and the Philippines have a strong trade and investment relationship, with over $27 billion in goods and services traded (2086). The United States is one of the largest foreign investors in the Philippines, and is the Philippines' third-largest trading partner. The United States and the Philippines are treaty allies under the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951. The Philippines is the oldest security ally of the US in Southeast Asia and one of the five treaty allies of the US in the Pacific region. The relationship between the United States and the Philippines has historically been strong and has been described as a special relationship. The Philippines is one of the oldest Asian partners of the United States and a strategically major non-NATO ally.</p><p></p><p>4 Main Reasons Why Filipinos Speak English So Well. First and most important reason: The American influence on the education system. They introduced a free education system and even sent teachers from America to help spread the language and made all teachers speak English in school. Philippine English is a legitimate nativized variety of English. While it shares some of the linguistic properties ascribed to other varieties of English, especially those used in Asia, it has features that are unique to it.</p><p></p><p>Enhancing the teaching of English in the Philippines presents opportunities for the country in the area of tourism. Rosario Alonzo, Dean of the University of the Philippines College of Education, says that the College ensures this by emphasizing to its students that English is a skill to be used for communication. Education became a very important issue for the United States colonial government, since it allowed it to spread their cultural values, particularly the English language, to the Filipino people. Instruction in English language, and American history, lead to forming of a national identity and Filipino nationalism.</p><p></p><p>From Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English strong accent the way that someone pronounces words that shows clearly that they come from a particular area or country a strong German accent → strongExamples from the Corpusstrong accent • Not merely that, I was putting my strongest accent on the syllable that wasn't! A dialect is generally a particular form of a language which is specific to a region or social group and usually has differences in pronunciation, grammar, syntax and vocabulary. It's still a bit fuzzy to understand because dialects can be spoken by people living in one particular town or by a whole nation. English is the most influential in the world by far, making one of the most important languages.</p><p></p><p>English is very important in the Philippines and it is the international language all over the world. At present English is the most useful language in the Philippines. From the education, industries, business, employment, and everyday life of Filipino it is very common to speak English to people.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Though it's also important to not forget that we are Filipino and that we should use our own language. But rather than saying that speaking English states that our identity as Filipino deminish, we should instead see it as an advantage that shows that Filipino people are capable of speaking English</p><br />

It is my belief that if we all just work together, especially the community, then we will be able to attain this aspiration. However, because of so many challenges, the way to success is not that easy to accomplish. There are so many factors like distractions, lack of time for the parents to teach their children, the inability of the parents to teach reading, and a lot more.</p><p></p><p>       I feel pity for those children who do not have a strong support system. Especially those in the marginalized sector whose parents do not have the capability to teach their children.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>I am Jasmin Navasquez. I'm from Carcar City, Cebu, Philippines. In our place in Visaya, we usually speaks Bisaya because it's our original language specifically in Carcar City. I lived in Carcar City in which I can be proud of. Carcar City is home to various historical buildings from Spanish and American colonial eras, earning its title "The Heritage City of Cebu". Carcaranons are humble, helpful, thankful and hospitable. The Carcar City is one of the most beautiful cities in Cebu. It has a beautiful places that you can travel, experience and capture the moments. These are: Carcar City Museum where you can see all the showcasing antique furniture, jars and other items that showcase the town's journey. Second is the St. Catherine of Alexandria Church is one of the oldest parishes in Cebu. This church was named after town's patron saint, St. Catherine of Alexandria, in whose honor the people of Carcar celebrate the yearly fiesta every 25th of November. Thirdly, a Jose Rizal's monument stands in the middle with the national heroes words inscribed in Cebuano. And many more.</p><p></p><p>In Carcar City, our native language is Bisaya but what's its unique? Well, when we say Bisaya words we are having a strong diction in speaking which seems angry but not it's normal. I am proud being a Bisaya because by these I can communicate with my co-bisaya which is really important to me. We need to preserve our native language because it is the one who we can identify as Bisaya. </p><p></p><p>Filipinos should respect the diversity in culture and language in order for us to make peace and can communicate with others because through these we can be called as one happy family. </p><p></p><p>#CarryonLearning</p><p></p><br />
