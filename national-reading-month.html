First, be reallyaware of yourselves and what is going on in our country. In spite of differences,you all belong to one nation. Second, develop a sense of commitment to thePhilippines. Commitment means much more than just standing up to the tune ofthe National Anthem. It means contributing something to the progress anddevelopment of the Philippines no matter how small. It means doing your workfaithfullyand well. It also means upholding the ideals and heritage of the Filipinonation. Third, respect each other and work well with each other. You are going tobe leaders of this country, and you are here as individuals sincerely trying todevelop yourselves to understand and commit yourselves to the Philippines, andto get skills of working with large groups.Describe what a Leader is.Describe what a leader is notWhat a leader should doа.Folosdiob.C.What commitment means10- owenisinpostena.b.C.​</a>

It is my belief that if we all just work together, especially the community, then we will be able to attain this aspiration. However, because of so many challenges, the way to success is not that easy to accomplish. There are so many factors like distractions, lack of time for the parents to teach their children, the inability of the parents to teach reading, and a lot more.</p><p></p><p>       I feel pity for those children who do not have a strong support system. Especially those in the marginalized sector whose parents do not have the capability to teach their children. It is my belief that the government should do something about it. </p><p></p><p>      In my opinion, we should set a realistic goal so that these children will be able to read despite not going to school face to face. </p><p></p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>National Reading Month is celebrated in March to honor Dr. Suess’s birthday. In this month people, especially children, read a lot more in celebration and although some people may find the increased emphasis on reading to be boring, the increase in reading during this month has significant benefits that will continue to pay off in the future. Reading is one of the best habits to develop; it strengthens the mental muscles, helps to improve comprehension and analytical abilities, and increases imagination and boosts memory.</p><p></p><p></p><p>HISTORY OF NATIONAL READING MONTH</p><p>March was designated as National Reading Month to celebrate Dr. Suess. He was born on March 2, 1904. Interestingly enough, Dr. Suess was not a doctor at all, he was a writer and an illustrator of very popular children’s books including “The Cat in the Hat” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”. He also wrote several books for beginner readers of which “One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish” (published in 1960) was the most notable one. He received a Pulitzer Prize in 1984 for his contribution to the education of America’s children and their parents.</p><br />
