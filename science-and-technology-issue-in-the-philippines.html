                        Numerous issues have been raised in the on-going election campaign. Unfortunately, one of the most strategic issues facing the Philippines has not yet been addressed: the key role of science and technology in the Philippine development plan.<br /><br />It is now clearly accepted that science, technology and innovation (STI) are a key elements in the advancement of a country. Indeed, there is no country that has progressed without including STI as a central part of their development plan. All progressive countries in the world have put STI as a centerpiece of their strategy. The Philippines has failed to do this. This national election must address this question and the new administration must correct this failure.<br /><br />The Philippines faces multiple global and local challenges which require science, technology and innovation. These include:<br />the intensifying competition from globalization and regional integration;<br />natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change;<br />and persistent poverty and increasing inequality.<br />Without STI: we will not be competitive; we will continue to suffer great damage from natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change; and we will continue to be poor.<br />

                        <p> </p><p>1.There are many science-related issues in the Philippines. There is a need for more funding in science and technology. Basic sciences, applied sciences, helpful research, and technology innovation should be emphasized in all levels of education to address present-day national needs. We need to improve our quality of life with modern medical advancements like remote health care, which is not available to most Filipinos nowadays, even if they have the money to afford it. Availability of reliable power sources like solar panels (like Tesla's) or coal plants (like SMIC) would also contribute to the country's advancement; these energy production problems are very much present too! And lastly, there's food insecurity, agricultural studies/innovations come to mind</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                            9. identify alteast one issue in the Philippines what science and technology related policies could be developed &amp;important to solve this issue ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>• Water filtration systems should be distributed in the provinces. It should be implemented by the government to ensure the health and well-being of the Filipinos living in rural areas, where the supply of safe drinking water is scarce. They should dig deep wells with filtering capabilities for the citizens. The Department of Science and Technology is currently developing a cost-effective water filtration system using ceramic and clay in the process. I hope it will be carried out to the needy citizens upon its release and development.</p><p></p><p>• Hospitals and health clinics should be built by our government, each town or city should have at least one.</p><p></p><p>• Farm to market roads should be built in many communities, so that farmers would have a bigger chance of increasing their income by cutting the agricultural supply chain that the abusive middlemen exploit and take advantage of.</p><p></p><p>• Farming should be MECHANIZED, to increase the agricultural output of farms and to give farmers the chance to have the time in different activities while the machinery takes care of all the hard manual work under the heat of the sun.</p><p></p><p>• Vertical housing should be provided to poor residents in big cities, so that they won’t end up being squatters in government and private-owned land. The residential units can be sold in an affordable price with reasonable monthly rates that the poor working class can afford.</p><p></p><p>• Many roads should be opened and constructed. This is to avoid the traffic congestion that makes the life of urban Filipinos miserable. There are a lot of elevated and elliptical roads that can be constructed above the traditional highways to provide vehicles with many options on where are they going to pass-by.</p><p></p><p>• An efficient, disaster response system should be created. This is imperative if the Philippines is really aiming for zero casualties during calamities, owing the fact that our archipelago are frequented by earthquakes, storms, tidal surge, volcanic eruptions and many similar disasters. Highly mobile disaster vehicles such as amphibious vehicles and ambulances should be deployed in every town, city and municipality.</p><p></p><p>• Our railroads should be revived. Especially, the Ferrocaril de Manila, a traditional commuter railway that runs from Dagupan City in Pangasinan in the north, down to Manila in the National Capital Region and down to Legazpi Albay in the south. It is the most common form of transportation during the American period, and according to the older population, it’s fast and cost-effective. Sadly, the said commuter rail was destroyed during the Second World War and was never rehabilitated. Today, only a portion of the railway from Tutuban, Manila to Calamba, Laguna is currently in use. The rest had been defunct in the past few decades.</p><p></p><p>With proper technology, navigable river highways can be created to decongest Manila, like the Manila Bay-Pasig River-Marikina River- Laguna de Bay waterway that will connect Metro Manila eastward to Rizal and Laguna provinces, or the Manila Bay-Angat River-Pampanga River-Peñaranda River-Tarlac River-Agno River mega waterway, that could potentially connect Manila to the northern provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Pangasinan and Tarlac with the province of Benguet as its extreme northernmost passenger port.</p><p></p><p>• Renewable clean energy should be preferred over traditional ones. The Philippines have vast potential for its renewable energy, because it is abundant in natural resources and is located in a region with favorable climatic conditions. We have vast potential in harnessing our resources for biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar and wind production and making it as a sustainable source of energy, reducing the reliance on coal, petroleum and other non-renewable sources.</p><p></p><p>As for the problem with our garbage disposal, we can create garbage liquification and gasification facilities to convert our filth into a usable energy source. Many recyclable trash should also be distributed in recycling facilities to avoid being stuck in landfills.</p><p></p><p>• Degraded and denuded lands should be reforested again. We should plant more trees to preserve the ecological balance of our country and prevent our animal and plant species from becoming extinct. We should plant the right species of trees, and we should prefer native ones ( Apitong, Ipil, Kamagong, Lauan, Narra, Yakal, etc) more than foreign ones to preserve our tree species once found in our primeval forests.</p><p></p><p>Our coastal areas should be planted with mangroves to increase the vitality of our marine ecosystems and increase the food production of our fishermen. Mangroves also serve as natural barriers against water-borne disasters, such as tidal surges, whirlpools and other similar phenomena.</p><p></p><p>These are just some of the important things that I want to emphasize in tackling some of the important issues plaguing my country today.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Scientific research is always an afterthought in the Philippines. They are performed almost solely by students, interns, and those undergoing training (Medical Residents) in order to fulfill academic requirements. These, of course, are poorly funded and mostly, due to time constraints and the reasons they were performed in the first place, mediocre.</p><p></p><p>Businesses rarely do have budget for research and development in the Philippines because of lack of funds and government support. Also, we rarely have manufacturing companies, and if we do, they build basic commodities that don't require much research.</p><p></p><p>The Department of Science and Technology is there to provide support. However, it is ridden with politics and corruption. I know of private, for-profit companies that are funded by DOST! There goes our research fund.</p><p></p><p>Maybe if we entice more foreign manufacturing investors to setup factories here and cut a technology transfer deal, we can learn a few things. With proper government support, good engineers, and adequate infrastructure, maybe some enterpreneur will have the heart to build something innovative and desirable.</p><p></p><p>For know, we rely on all things foreign. Even to track typhoons coming our way! PAGASA is hopeless.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.)Numerous issues have been raised in the on-going election campaign. Unfortunately, one of the most strategic issues facing the Philippines has not yet been addressed: the key role of science and technology in the Philippine development plan.</p><p> </p><p>It is now clearly accepted that science, technology and innovation (STI) are a key elements in the advancement of a country. Indeed, there is no country that has progressed without including STI as a central part of their development plan. All progressive countries in the world have put STI as a centerpiece of their strategy. The Philippines has failed to do this. This national election must address this question and the new administration must correct this failure.</p><p> </p><p>2.)The Philippines faces multiple global and local challenges which require science, technology and innovation. These include:</p><p>the intensifying competition from globalization and regional integration;</p><p>natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change;</p><p>and persistent poverty and increasing inequality.</p><p>Without STI: we will not be competitive; we will continue to suffer great damage from natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change; and we will continue to be poor.</p><p> </p><p>How the Philippines responds to these challenges will determine whether the country will experience rapid, inclusive and sustained growth and development or revert to the status of the economic laggard of the region which includes high-performing countries, such as Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and China. (China, our giant neighbor, recently announced that it will increase its investment in science and technology over the next 5 years and cut red tape which hampers science and innovation).</p><br />

But the greatest issue plaguing our nation is the incompetence and corruption of government officials.</p><p></p><p>These are some of the issues that could be solved with the utilization of modern technology. I believe these are the possible solutions to the problems that I’ve mentioned:</p><p></p><p>• More access to contraceptives. The Philippines is still a “ conservative” Catholic country. The use of contraceptives are highly discouraged. I believe a reform in our curriculum regarding sex education and responsible parenthood should be revised and heavily explained in our school curriculum. Couples should be given wider access to contraceptives to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Those who are poor and illiterate should be taught by government health workers regarding this matter through public forums and seminars. It should be mandatory.</p><p></p><p>• Water filtration systems should be distributed in the provinces. It should be implemented by the government to ensure the health and well-being of the Filipinos living in rural areas, where the supply of safe drinking water is scarce. They should dig deep wells with filtering capabilities for the citizens. The Department of Science and Technology is currently developing a cost-effective water filtration system using ceramic and clay in the process. I hope it will be carried out to the needy citizens upon its release and development.</p><p></p><p>• Portable toilets should be created in the far-flung provinces. It’s no longer a big problem as it is in the past, since 85–90% of our population have access to toilets. Sanitary facilities should be made priority to those residing near river and sea ecosystems to avoid contamination and harm of marine species.</p><p></p><p>• Hospitals and health clinics should be built by our government, each town or city should have at least one.</p><p></p><p>• Farm to market roads should be built in many communities, so that farmers would have a bigger chance of increasing their income by cutting the agricultural supply chain that the abusive middlemen exploit and take advantage of.</p><p></p><p>• Farming should be MECHANIZED, to increase the agricultural output of farms and to give farmers the chance to have the time in different activities while the machinery takes care of all the hard manual work under the heat of the sun.</p><p></p><p>• Vertical housing should be provided to poor residents in big cities, so that they won’t end up being squatters in government and private-owned land.

This is to avoid the traffic congestion that makes the life of urban Filipinos miserable. There are a lot of elevated and elliptical roads that can be constructed above the traditional highways to provide vehicles with many options on where are they going to pass-by.</p><p></p><p>• An efficient, disaster response system should be created. This is imperative if the Philippines is really aiming for zero casualties during calamities, owing the fact that our archipelago are frequented by earthquakes, storms, tidal surge, volcanic eruptions and many similar disasters. Highly mobile disaster vehicles such as amphibious vehicles and ambulances should be deployed in every town, city and municipality.</p><p></p><p>• Our railroads should be revived. Especially, the Ferrocaril de Manila, a traditional commuter railway that runs from Dagupan City in Pangasinan in the north, down to Manila in the National Capital Region and down to Legazpi Albay in the south. It is the most common form of transportation during the American period, and according to the older population, it’s fast and cost-effective. Sadly, the said commuter rail was destroyed during the Second World War and was never rehabilitated. Today, only a portion of the railway from Tutuban, Manila to Calamba, Laguna is currently in use. The rest had been defunct in the past few decades.</p><p></p><p>Another thing is that we should bring back the double-decker buses. This is a great way of relieving commuters of the horrible “ standing ovation” situation in commuter buses everyday.</p><p></p><br />

                            26. Identify several issues in the Philippines. What science and technology-related policies could be developed and implemented to solve these issues?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines faces multiple global and local challenges which require science, technology and innovation. These include:
</p><p>
</p><p>the intensifying competition from globalization and regional integration;
</p><p>
</p><p>natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change;
</p><p>
</p><p>and persistent poverty and increasing inequality.
</p><p>
</p><p>Without STI: we will not be competitive; we will continue to suffer great damage from natural disasters, environmental degradation and climate change; and we will continue to be poor.
</p><p>
</p><p>How the Philippines responds to these challenges will determine whether the country will experience rapid, inclusive and sustained growth and development or revert to the status of the economic laggard of the region which includes high-performing countries, such as Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and China. (China, our giant neighbor, recently announced that it will increase its investment in science and technology over the next 5 years and cut red tape which hampers science and innovation)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
