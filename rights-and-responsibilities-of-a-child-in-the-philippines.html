EXERCISES Discuss the reading selection below with your partner and write a 1 paragraph (5 sentences) summary about the important information being discussed in the text Juvenile delinquency is characterized by unruly conduct of youth age 10 to 17, that is beyond parental control and thus requires legal action (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). Drugs, sexual assault, robbery, physical injury and other illegal activities and behaviour that most of the teens commit. In the Philippines, the number of minors involved in delinquency had increased from 10, 388 in 2017 to 11,228 in 2018. Many of our dear teens are engaged in such dreadful and terrifying crimes and activities that you can't imagine they can do because of their young age. The increase of numbers of the juvenile delinquent is quite alarming and worrisome. 15 year old felons and below are spared in trial and jail however the age of the children who partake in such unlawful activities are getting younger and younger, some of this offender's even age as five years old. Due to this, Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 increased the minimum age of criminal responsibility that allows the child to undertake criminal proceeding in court. It also requires a minor delinquent to undergo therapy. From study and research, most of the minors who are part of these illicit deeds are ignored and abandoned by their own parents and family or they seek attention from them. Parents must always check on their child and guide them towards the right path away from the dangerous way that can destroy their life and re. In relation to this, Senate President Vicente Sotto II urges the government to support, and to fund the places for rehabilitations for the juvenile delinquents since many of the shelters are neglected and abandoned. The House of Representatives approved on final reading the House Bill 8855 which lowers the criminal charge from 15 to just 12 years old on January 28, 2019. SUMMARY​</a>

L CONCEPT NOTES In summarizing important information from a text read or listened to you must take note and remember the key points or main ideas and the necessary details for you to create a summary II. EXERCISES Discuss the reading selection below with your partner and write a 1 paragraph (5 sentences) summary about the important information being discussed in the text Juvenile delinquency is characterized by unruly conduct of youth age 10 to 17, that is beyond parental control and thus requires legal action (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). Drugs, sexual assault, robbery, physical injury and other illegal activities and behaviour that most of the teens commit. In the Philippines, the number of minors involved in delinquency had increased from 10, 388 in 2017 to 11,228 in 2018. Many of our dear teens are engaged in such dreadful and terrifying crimes and activities that you can't imagine they can do because of their young age. The increase of numbers of the juvenile delinquent is quite alarming and worrisome. 15 year old felons and below are spared in trial and jail however the age of the children who partake in such unlawful activities are getting younger and younger, some of this offender's even age as five years old. Due to this, Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 increased the minimum age of criminal responsibility that allows the child to undertake criminal proceeding in court. It also requires a minor delinquent to undergo therapy. From study and research, most of the minors who are part of these illicit deeds are ignored and abandoned by their own parents and family or they seek attention from them. Parents must always check on their child and guide them towards the right path away from the dangerous way that can destroy their life and re. In relation to this, Senate President Vicente Sotto II urges the government to support, and to fund the places for rehabilitations for the juvenile delinquents since many of the shelters are neglected and abandoned. The House of Representatives approved on final reading the House Bill 8855 which lowers the criminal charge from 15 to just 12 years old on January 28, 2019. SUMMARY​</h2><br />
