                                            For both films, I will only focus on a few values that are most present. The first series we’ll explore is Spider-Man. The first Spider-
Man movie came out in 2002 and is ranked seventh of all time US box office grossing films. The second movie is ranked 10th and
the third movie is currently ranked 92nd although this movie can move up as it is still in theaters. Spider-Man is one helpful dude,
no argument there. He does everything from Thor crimes to rescue people from burning buildings. Now, that’s helpfulness. Even
though saving the city from various deranged supervillains is a time-consuming activity, Peter Parker in line with Williams’ site of
US values is still seeking employment. He is not the only one either. His Uncle Ben having been let go from a previous job is
attempting to find another one. In this scene, Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker discuss work as Mary Jane is on her way to
an audition and she had previously got off of work. Science and technology is everywhere in Spider-Man so without further
ado, here are a few examples:
A. Oscorp in their weapons and human performing enhancers which Norman ends up using to cause all sorts of trouble
B. The genetic engineering lab where Peter Parker is bit by a radioactive spider changing his DNA giving him the abilities he
uses as Spider-man
C. Dr. Octavius in his fusion reactor and of course the infamous mechanical arms
D. The particle physics facility that brings about sandman and Harry Osborne’s resurrection of all his father’s gadgets and gizmos
that he uses to knock the snot out of Peter Parker
The second and final story we will be looking at is Harry Potter. Education is clearly seen in these films as the main setting is
the school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts. When looking at efficiency, there is nothing more efficient than magic. You
say it and it happens. It’s that simple. The value of achievement and success has a large presence in the Harry Potter story. For
example, the competition between the four houses within the school, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw is entirely
about outdoing others. Harry Potter consistently outdoes others. He has praised for his achievements such as his skill in the wizard
game of quidditch. In this scene, we see Harry being applauded for his completion of the latest Triwizard tournament stage.
Harry Potter, even with his success, does face the small problem of attempts on his life. As a baby, Harry Potter brings down the
leader of a wizard superiority group when the leader’s spell meant to kill Harry backfires.
Harry runs into the same group superiority value almost immediately when he enters Hogwarts. In this scene from the fourth
movie, we see the wizard superiority group named the death eaters assemble. Their leader is now back in power after previously
being crippled during the encounter with Harry as a baby. This plot will continue in the next movie which has yet to be released.
As you have seen, Robin Williams’ American values with Jane Henslin’s traditions are quite present in top US grossing films. Some
of these values may lose their importance as our society changes. Williams already believes activity at work is becoming less
important. Other values may even come into being. But what makes these social values and films popular for such a broad
audience? Can we conclude that these values are what makes the films popular or is it the films themselves that make these
social values? - Edworks Production

Chopin -1899)
_______2. “The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast
begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut
paste out of a little shop. It tasted partly of the paper in which it is wrapped,
partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown”. (A Room with a View, E.M.
Forster -1908)
_______3. “The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smoldering, unclean
yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight. It is dull yet lurid orange
in some places, a sickly sulfur tint in others.” (The Yellow Wallpaper, Charlotte

_______4. “I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window,
and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall.” (Jane Eyre, Charlotte

leaves and the wood of plant stems.” (When God Was Stolen, Cary Osborne-

Clinical Situation
“Harley” is a 4yr NM known for ingesting clothing, toys, and anything he can get in his mouth. He has been vomiting for 2 days and is lethargic. He appears depressed and in some discomfort when Annie, the vet assistant, takes him into the exam room. “Harley” has a normal RR and HR but has an elevated temperature of 103.0 degrees.
  Dr. Osborne completes a PE, blood work and orders radiographs. The x-rays show a buildup of gas in the stomach and small intestine, but no foreign body is noted. Dr. Osborne suggests that “Harley” be admitted for a barium study.
Annie and Katherine, another vet assistant, admit “Harley” into the ICU. The owner has several questions for the assistants as they place “Harley” into a kennel. Her main concern is asking about the barium study procedure.
What should the assistants explain to the owner about the barium study?
 What should be discussed with the owner if the veterinarian finds that surgery is needed?
 What supplies and equipment are needed to complete the barium study radiographs?
 What steps should the assistants take in admitting “Harley” into the ICU?</a>

(Samuel Osborne, Thursday 2 April 2020) 'My orders to the police and military ... if there is trouble and there's an occasion that they fight back and your lives are in danger, shoot them dead' The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has warned anyone who violates the country's coronavirus lockdown measures could be shot. In a televised address, Mr. Duterte said it was vital everyone cooperates and follows home quarantine measures. He also said the abuse of medical workers was a serious crime that would not be tolerated. Authorities are fighting to slow the spread of Covid-19 and spare the country's fragile health system from being overwhelmed. The Philippines has recorded 96 coronavirus deaths and 2,311 confirmed cases, with infections now being reported in the hundreds each day. 1. inimu​</a>

                            5. For both films, I will only focus on a few values that are most present. The first series we’ll explore is Spider-Man. The first Spider-
Man movie came out in 2002 and is ranked seventh of all time US box office grossing films. The second movie is ranked 10th and
the third movie is currently ranked 92nd although this movie can move up as it is still in theaters. Spider-Man is one helpful dude,
no argument there. He does everything from Thor crimes to rescue people from burning buildings. Now, that’s helpfulness. Even
though saving the city from various deranged supervillains is a time-consuming activity, Peter Parker in line with Williams’ site of
US values is still seeking employment. He is not the only one either. His Uncle Ben having been let go from a previous job is
attempting to find another one. In this scene, Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker discuss work as Mary Jane is on her way to
an audition and she had previously got off of work. Science and technology is everywhere in Spider-Man so without further
ado, here are a few examples:
A. Oscorp in their weapons and human performing enhancers which Norman ends up using to cause all sorts of trouble
B. The genetic engineering lab where Peter Parker is bit by a radioactive spider changing his DNA giving him the abilities he
uses as Spider-man
C. Dr. Octavius in his fusion reactor and of course the infamous mechanical arms
D. The particle physics facility that brings about sandman and Harry Osborne’s resurrection of all his father’s gadgets and gizmos
that he uses to knock the snot out of Peter Parker
The second and final story we will be looking at is Harry Potter. Education is clearly seen in these films as the main setting is
the school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts. When looking at efficiency, there is nothing more efficient than magic. You
say it and it happens. It’s that simple. The value of achievement and success has a large presence in the Harry Potter story. For
example, the competition between the four houses within the school, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw is entirely
about outdoing others. Harry Potter consistently outdoes others. He has praised for his achievements such as his skill in the wizard
game of quidditch. In this scene, we see Harry being applauded for his completion of the latest Triwizard tournament stage.
Harry Potter, even with his success, does face the small problem of attempts on his life. As a baby, Harry Potter brings down the
leader of a wizard superiority group when the leader’s spell meant to kill Harry backfires.
Harry runs into the same group superiority value almost immediately when he enters Hogwarts. In this scene from the fourth
movie, we see the wizard superiority group named the death eaters assemble. Their leader is now back in power after previously
being crippled during the encounter with Harry as a baby. This plot will continue in the next movie which has yet to be released.
As you have seen, Robin Williams’ American values with Jane Henslin’s traditions are quite present in top US grossing films. Some
of these values may lose their importance as our society changes. Williams already believes activity at work is becoming less
important. Other values may even come into being. But what makes these social values and films popular for such a broad
audience? Can we conclude that these values are what makes the films popular or is it the films themselves that make these
social values? - Edworks Production

                            11. The Digestive System
Clinical Situation
“Harley” is a 4yr NM known for ingesting clothing, toys, and anything he can get in his mouth. He has been vomiting for 2 days and is lethargic. He appears depressed and in some discomfort when Annie, the vet assistant, takes him into the exam room. “Harley” has a normal RR and HR but has an elevated temperature of 103.0 degrees.
  Dr. Osborne completes a PE, blood work and orders radiographs. The x-rays show a buildup of gas in the stomach and small intestine, but no foreign body is noted. Dr. Osborne suggests that “Harley” be admitted for a barium study.
Annie and Katherine, another vet assistant, admit “Harley” into the ICU. The owner has several questions for the assistants as they place “Harley” into a kennel. Her main concern is asking about the barium study procedure.
What should the assistants explain to the owner about the barium study?
 What should be discussed with the owner if the veterinarian finds that surgery is needed?
 What supplies and equipment are needed to complete the barium study radiographs?
 What steps should the assistants take in admitting “Harley” into the ICU?</h2><br />

The procedure is also called a colon X-ray.An enema is the injection of a liquid into your rectum through a small tube. In this case, the liquid contains a metallic substance (barium) that coats the lining of the colon. Normally, an X-ray produces a poor image of soft tissues, but the barium coating results in a relatively clear silhouette of the colon<p></p>Mechanical Ventilation IntubationCentral Venous Catheterization Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)Arterial linesChest tubesTracheostomy Feeding TubesMechanical VentilationWhat is mechanical ventilation?Mechanical ventilation is a form of artificial respiration that uses a breathing machine (ventilator) to assist patients with their breathing.What are the benefits?Mechanical ventilation is used when the lungs are not functioning properly. This breathing support may be used to help get enough oxygen to the body and to remove carbon dioxide.  Sometimes ICU patients need support from a ventilator because they are not awake enough or strong enough to breath safely on their own.What are the risks?Patients who require a breathing machine are at increased risk to develop infections of the lungs, called pneumonia. Occasionally, patients may develop a collapsed lung from the pressure used to push the air into the lungs. Both of these complications require treatment.<br />
