Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.

MANILA- Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4, the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions emain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Answer. 4. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing, but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about heir busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't ech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have ecome a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the- ellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities. nswer. Reading is fun! But should it be required?

                                            Text C (10 pts) Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, January 20)-COVID-19 response deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said Wednesday the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management Emerging Infectious Diseases would assess by end of January whether the current age restrictions can be eased. Dizon was reacting to a report on the proposal of the Trade Department to allow 10-year-old children to go out of their homes to help stimulate economic activity. Current IATF rules permit those aged 15 to 65 years old to stay outdoors. Meanwhile, those covered by the age restrictions could only leave their houses to access essential items and services. The official said the decision will mainly depend on whether the holidays and Black Nazarene festivities triggered a surge in the number of COVID - 19 cases. The Department of Health earlier said it expects to know about the possible impact of holiday gatherings and the Black Nazarene feast celebration this month. "Tingin ko po (I think) by end of Jan. or Feb., it will be reevaluated and we will see if we can ease some more depending on what happens to our cases," Dizon told the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. Devotees were earlier allowed to attend mass celebrations in Quiapo Church for the Feast of the Black Nazarene on Jan. 9. Masses were held in lieu of the Traslacion or grand procession of the Black Nazarene image, which traditionally draws millions of Catholic faithful. Experts have warned of a spike in coronavirus cases which might lead to stricter movement restrictions after up to 400,000 devotees visited the Quiapo area on the eve and on the day of the Black Nazarene feast. Dizon said they will also consider their experts' advice on this matter, noting that most of the IATF advisers are medical professionals. "I think when our medical advisers come to a point where they are comfortable na (that) it will not cause a tremendous risk to the general population, then restrictions on age will be slowly eased as well," he said.

San Miguel Beer went on a 20 - 7 start and never looked back as it held TNT to a shell of its former self, limiting the Tropang Giga to their lowest offensive output since November 2013 when they dropped a 77-63 decision to Petron. "This is a big game for us and I'm thankful for the players because the sense of urgency is there," said San Miguel head coach Leo Austria as his team improved to 4 - 2 record to get to the fourth spot in the ladder.2. There should be zoos because zoos save animals and help people learn a lot about them. Did you know that thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don't receive in the wild. When they get sick or hurt, expert veterinarians look after them until they get totally healed. In many big zoos, animals are made to feel like they are in the wild. There are no longer cages, and the fences are hidden. Zookeepers hide the food from the animals so they can learn to hunt, and in some zoos, glass walls are tinted so the animals don't see the chaos created by people around them. I am really glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals, and I am thankful we have zoos.Read each of the sentences below and identify its type of journalistic writing.

If we will love one another, we will be living in a better world.3. MANILA-Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4. the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions remain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-194. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing,but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about their busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't tech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have become a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the wellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities.5. Reading is fun! But should it be required?

Augustinians in 1500, followed by the Jesuits in 1630. The town was
first called “Marquina,” after the Spanish governor-general Felix
Berenguer de Marquina; the name was changed to “Marikina” during

Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times - with or without disasters. Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities. In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed. "At the center of malnutrition's underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices." Parreño added. “And we don't have a structure curriculum addressing this," he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9. Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle. The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also and school-based supplementary feeding programs. pa help po​</h2><br />

Answer. 4. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing, but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about heir busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't ech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have ecome a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the- ellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities. nswer. Reading is fun! But should it be required?

                            15. Text C (10 pts) Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, January 20)-COVID-19 response deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said Wednesday the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management Emerging Infectious Diseases would assess by end of January whether the current age restrictions can be eased. Dizon was reacting to a report on the proposal of the Trade Department to allow 10-year-old children to go out of their homes to help stimulate economic activity. Current IATF rules permit those aged 15 to 65 years old to stay outdoors. Meanwhile, those covered by the age restrictions could only leave their houses to access essential items and services. The official said the decision will mainly depend on whether the holidays and Black Nazarene festivities triggered a surge in the number of COVID - 19 cases. The Department of Health earlier said it expects to know about the possible impact of holiday gatherings and the Black Nazarene feast celebration this month. "Tingin ko po (I think) by end of Jan. or Feb., it will be reevaluated and we will see if we can ease some more depending on what happens to our cases," Dizon told the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. Devotees were earlier allowed to attend mass celebrations in Quiapo Church for the Feast of the Black Nazarene on Jan. 9. Masses were held in lieu of the Traslacion or grand procession of the Black Nazarene image, which traditionally draws millions of Catholic faithful. Experts have warned of a spike in coronavirus cases which might lead to stricter movement restrictions after up to 400,000 devotees visited the Quiapo area on the eve and on the day of the Black Nazarene feast. Dizon said they will also consider their experts' advice on this matter, noting that most of the IATF advisers are medical professionals. "I think when our medical advisers come to a point where they are comfortable na (that) it will not cause a tremendous risk to the general population, then restrictions on age will be slowly eased as well," he said.

There should be zoos because zoos save animals and help people learn a lot about them. Did you know that thirty species of animals were saved because of zoos? Zoos give great care that most animals don't receive in the wild. When they get sick or hurt, expert veterinarians look after them until they get totally healed. In many big zoos, animals are made to feel like they are in the wild. There are no longer cages, and the fences are hidden. Zookeepers hide the food from the animals so they can learn to hunt, and in some zoos, glass walls are tinted so the animals don't see the chaos created by people around them. I am really glad the zookeepers give their time to care for the animals, and I am thankful we have zoos.Read each of the sentences below and identify its type of journalistic writing.

MANILA-Both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may visit reopened parks in Manila following the region's shift to Alert Level 4. the tourism chief said Saturday, as restrictions remain in place to prevent the spread of COVID-194. With the ongoing pandemic and scarcity of available vaccines, senior citizens who are mostly grandparents and children below 18 years old have been cooped up at home for more than 18 months. Living with both age category groups in one house, especially during this unprecedented situation that we are in, is a blessing,but it also has its fair challenges. Peace and quiet are far and in between, which can be frustrating for those who work at home. But the upside to this is that grandparents can help take care of the kids as the parents go about their busy schedules. Families who aren't fortunate enough to share the same home have to make that extra effort to reach out to their loved ones, more so for those with elders who aren't tech savvy to order online for everyday essentials. Regular virtual calls to check on them have become a staple in routine. Whatever the setup is, we all share the same concern-the wellbeing of our grandparents/senior citizens should be part of our topmost priorities.5. Reading is fun! But should it be required?
