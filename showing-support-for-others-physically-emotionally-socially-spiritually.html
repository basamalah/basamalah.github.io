                            16. how does art affect you physically emotionally socially and spiritually​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When we think of paintings and the art of creating paintings, we might remember paintings we’ve seen, artwork we’ve admired, paintings we’ve purchased (or longed after). For the vast majority of us who are not already highly skilled artists, we equate painting(s) to the artwork of others that we see and appreciate.</p><p></p><p>We might even equate the art of painting to the emotions, feelings, and sentiments that we feel when we look at paintings. Some would say that there is an emotional and spiritual benefit to looking at and merely appreciating paintings.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Benefits of Painting – How Painting Helps us Soar Spiritually and Emotionally</p><p>There’s a great deal of valuable research and philosophical thought on the emotional and spiritual benefits of painting. For example, the Encyclopedia of Philosophy has an impressive dissertation on the connection between art and emotion. That dissertation is worth quoting:</p><p></p><p>“It is widely thought that the capacity of artworks to arouse emotions in audiences is a perfectly natural and unproblematic fact. It just seems obvious that we can feel sadness or pity for fictional characters, fear at the view of threatening monsters on the movie screen, and joy upon listening to upbeat, happy songs. This may be why so many of us are consumers of art in the first place. Good art, many of us tend to think, should not leave us cold.”</p><p>Art makes us feel something when we observe it. It follows logically then that art would make us feel something compelling when we create it as well.</p><p></p><p>And it's not just philosophers and other artists who feel this way. Some scientists even theorise that artistic expression does not stop at making us feel good. These experts believe that creative interaction in the arts can be used as a way to heal people, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. Quoting a peer-reviewed research paper published in the National Library of Medicine:</p><p></p><p>“Use of the arts in healing does not contradict the medical view in bringing emotional, somatic, artistic, and spiritual dimensions to learning. Rather, it complements the biomedical view by focusing on not only sickness and symptoms themselves but the holistic nature of the person. When people are invited to work with creative and artistic processes that affect more than their identity with illness, they are more able to ‘create congruence between their affective states and their conceptual sense-making.’ Through creativity and imagination, we find our identity and our reservoir of healing.”</p><p>So we see that creating art, drawing a brush across a canvas, and making something is not only emotionally and spiritually uplifting for us; it is also something that heals us. And last but not least, it is something that we all can do, even if we've never done it before.</p><p></p><p>Life With Paint offers a chance for people who have never before held a paintbrush in their hands to create beautiful masterpieces that they can then take home with them. Students hang their artwork on their wall and appreciate the memory and the creativity that their Life With Paint class inspired in them. A lot of art appreciators become art creators after their first Life With Paint class. These social painting classes are a great way for a beginner artist to get started with painting.</p><p></p><p>No knowledge of painting techniques is required. Expect a great time and an emotionally uplifting, spiritually fulfilling experience.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Showing Support for Others
</strong><p><strong>Situation: </strong>A new group member who loses hope because of many problems.<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Support physically: </strong>You can help with his physical weakness by lending a hand.<strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>Support emotionally: </strong>You can give him moral support as a concerned friend.<strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>Support socially:</strong> You can give him hope and persuade him not to give up by inviting him to community gatherings.<strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>Support spiritually: </strong>You can invite him to take some time to rest and meditate.<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p>Serving others benefits our mental health, emotional well-being, and self-esteem.Helping others makes us happy and releases endorphins into our bodies.Helping others improves social interaction, diverts attention away from one's own problems, and boosts one's self-esteem and competence.<strong>

                            30. you have a classmate who experiences social discrimination due to his poor academic performance, how can you support physically, emotionally,socially and spiritually​</h2><br />
                        Answers and Explanations:
<strong>Physically</strong><p>As a classmate, I’ll help him through teaching the lessons that he is hard to cope up. Be a comforter so that he can relieve the sadness. And I am also lending my time to help him study and understand the teachings to improve his academic performance. In that way, I could assist him in overcoming it.</p><p></p><strong>Emotionally</strong><p>Make him feel that he is not alone in facing problems in life. Keep on showing it through my actions that I am here to support you no matter what. Then, I’ll tell him positive things or inspirations and keep on encouraging him. Also, I could be his shoulder to cry/lean on when he feels like giving up because of sadness caused by discrimination. I will be a good listener to what he says to understand his situation and show empathy.</p><p></p><strong>Socially</strong><p>I'll introduce him to my friends to enhance his socialization. In this way, I could release some of the heartaches and stress he is facing. And be a friend to him that will make him happy and at ease. And through the help of friends, including you, could assist his academics by having some small conversation. Accompany him always and let him try something new to himself.</p><p></p><strong>Spirituality</strong><p>Encourage him to pray and tell God all the problems he wants to get through. Let him know the power of prayer that could make him at peace and calm. Also, I will take him to church to have a better correlation with God all the time. And, I’ll tell him also to read the bible, so he makes a tight relationship with Him.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>To learn more here:</strong></p>What is discrimination<p>         brainly.ph/question/199904</p><p></p>Meaning of bullying and where to find help in case of bullied<p>         brainly.ph/question/1323526</p><p></p><p> </p><p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong></p><br />
