________1. A research title capsulizes the main thought or idea of the whole research paper and it also
reflects the variables under study.
________2. In writing the significance of the study, the researcher should start from specific to general
contribution.
________ 3. Controversial topic should be avoided in writing a research paper because it is prone to
opinions of the subject.
________ 4. You can narrow down the topic by exploring and extending the explanation of a theory and
by focusing on a specific group.
________ 5. A research question should not be answerable with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but rather
requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to composition of an answer.
________ 6. In writing the title of a qualitative research, it is always necessary to complete all the data
that answers what, where, who, and when even though it’s too long.
_________7. A research question should be arguable. Its potential answers are open to debate rather
than accepted facts.
________ 8. Research is usually limited in scope by sample size, time and geographic area; while the
delimitation of study is the description of the scope of study.
_________9. Research titles that start with indefinite adjectives such as several, many, some, etc., make
the topic vague.
________ 10. Your problem statement can guide you in identifying the specific contribution of your study.</a>

                                            Activity 3
For this exercise, you will use a Venn Diagram to organize your thoughts
about two subjects. Then you will write a paragraph that compares and/or
contrasts the subjects.
1. Choose a topic. Remember that the goal of your paragraph will be to give
a reader a deeper understanding of the relationship between two things. For
example: methods of cooking, types of diets, rural life vs. suburban life, etc.
2. Generate ideas. Write down as many things as possible that you can
think of about your topic. Make two lists, one of each item that is being
compared and/or contrasted.
3. Sort your ideas. Now use a Venn Diagram to sort your ideas into three
categories, as shown in the sample Venn Diagram. Write things that both
items have in common in the center of the diagram.
4. Determine your approach. Will you use an alternating or dividing
pattern to present your ideas? In the alternating method, you compare and
contrast two subjects point for point. In the dividing method, you make all
of your points about the first subject; then you make all of your points
about the second subject.
5. Draft your paragraph. Draft your paragraph on a separate sheet of
paper.</a>

They are concerned that the true mean is actually higher than could potentially lose a lot of money They randomly select 40 claims and calculate a sample mean of 195,000. Assuming that the standard deviation of claims is 50,000 and set a 0.05, test to see if the insurance company should be concerned or not 2. Suppose we are interested in a population of 20 industrial units of the same size, all of which are experiencing excessive lahor turnover problems. The past record show that the mean annual turnover is 320 employees, with a standard deviation of 75 employees. A sample of 5 of these industrial units is taken at random which gives a mean of annual turnover as 300 employees, is the sample mean consistent with the population mean? Test at 5% level. 3. According to the school librarian, the average number of pages of books in the reference section is 240. To test her claim, she collected a sample of 15 books and after noting the number of pages of each book, she determined that the mean number of pages is 224.6 with a standard deviation of 4.1. At a 0.01, will the librarian be able to prove her claim? 4. A special cable has a breaking strength of 800 pounds. The standard deviation of the population is 12 pounds. A researcher selects a sample of 20 cables and finds that the average breaking strength is 793 pounds. Can one reject the claim that the breaking strength is 800 pounds? Should the null hypothesis be rejected at a=0,012 Assume 18 that the variable normally distributed. 5. A health researcher read that a 200-pound male can burn an average of 546 calories per hour playing tennis. Thirty-six males were randomly selected and tested. The mean of the number of calories burned per hour was 544.8. Test the claim that the average number of calories burned is actually less than 546. Should the nuli hypothesis be rejected at a = 0.01? The standard deviation of the sample is 3. Can it be concluded that the average number of calories burned is less than onginally thought?​</a>

It has forced us to adapt to the new normal, including our way of learning. I am a student in [insert school name], and I would like to share my experience about my "new normal" learning.</p><p></p><p>Events:</p><p>At the beginning of the school year, our school has implemented a new learning system. We were given modules to study at home, and we have to submit them every two weeks. We also have weekly online meetings with our teachers to discuss our lessons and answer our questions.</p><p></p><p>At first, I found it challenging to study alone at home. There were a lot of distractions, and I missed interacting with my classmates. But as time went by, I learned to adjust to the new setup. I developed good study habits, such as managing my time effectively, setting goals, and being disciplined.</p><p></p><p>I also realized the importance of communication. Although we were physically distant from each other, our online meetings provided a way to connect and share our experiences. It was also an opportunity for us to support each other and encourage one another to keep going.</p><p></p><p>Ending:</p><p>My "new normal" learning experience taught me that I am capable of adapting to change. It also showed me the importance of being resilient, resourceful, and responsible. As we continue to face this pandemic, I believe that this experience has prepared me to face whatever challenges come my way.</p><br />

________1. A research title capsulizes the main thought or idea of the whole research paper and it also
reflects the variables under study.
________2. In writing the significance of the study, the researcher should start from specific to general
contribution.
________ 3. Controversial topic should be avoided in writing a research paper because it is prone to
opinions of the subject.
________ 4. You can narrow down the topic by exploring and extending the explanation of a theory and
by focusing on a specific group.
________ 5. A research question should not be answerable with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but rather
requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to composition of an answer.
________ 6. In writing the title of a qualitative research, it is always necessary to complete all the data
that answers what, where, who, and when even though it’s too long.
_________7. A research question should be arguable. Its potential answers are open to debate rather
than accepted facts.
________ 8. Research is usually limited in scope by sample size, time and geographic area; while the
delimitation of study is the description of the scope of study.
_________9. Research titles that start with indefinite adjectives such as several, many, some, etc., make
the topic vague.
________ 10. Your problem statement can guide you in identifying the specific contribution of your study.</h2><br />

                            13. Activity 3
For this exercise, you will use a Venn Diagram to organize your thoughts
about two subjects. Then you will write a paragraph that compares and/or
contrasts the subjects.
1. Choose a topic. Remember that the goal of your paragraph will be to give
a reader a deeper understanding of the relationship between two things. For
example: methods of cooking, types of diets, rural life vs. suburban life, etc.
2. Generate ideas. Write down as many things as possible that you can
think of about your topic. Make two lists, one of each item that is being
compared and/or contrasted.
3. Sort your ideas. Now use a Venn Diagram to sort your ideas into three
categories, as shown in the sample Venn Diagram. Write things that both
items have in common in the center of the diagram.
4. Determine your approach. Will you use an alternating or dividing
pattern to present your ideas? In the alternating method, you compare and
contrast two subjects point for point. In the dividing method, you make all
of your points about the first subject; then you make all of your points
about the second subject.
5. Draft your paragraph. Draft your paragraph on a separate sheet of
paper.</h2><br />

Write your answers in a yellow paper. 1. rates, they believed that average An insurance company is reviewing its current policy rates. When originally setting the the this, because they claim amount will be maximum of 180,000. They are concerned that the true mean is actually higher than could potentially lose a lot of money They randomly select 40 claims and calculate a sample mean of 195,000. Assuming that the standard deviation of claims is 50,000 and set a 0.05, test to see if the insurance company should be concerned or not 2. Suppose we are interested in a population of 20 industrial units of the same size, all of which are experiencing excessive lahor turnover problems. The past record show that the mean annual turnover is 320 employees, with a standard deviation of 75 employees. A sample of 5 of these industrial units is taken at random which gives a mean of annual turnover as 300 employees, is the sample mean consistent with the population mean? Test at 5% level. 3. According to the school librarian, the average number of pages of books in the reference section is 240. To test her claim, she collected a sample of 15 books and after noting the number of pages of each book, she determined that the mean number of pages is 224.6 with a standard deviation of 4.1. At a 0.01, will the librarian be able to prove her claim? 4. A special cable has a breaking strength of 800 pounds. The standard deviation of the population is 12 pounds. A researcher selects a sample of 20 cables and finds that the average breaking strength is 793 pounds. Can one reject the claim that the breaking strength is 800 pounds? Should the null hypothesis be rejected at a=0,012 Assume 18 that the variable normally distributed. 5. A health researcher read that a 200-pound male can burn an average of 546 calories per hour playing tennis. Thirty-six males were randomly selected and tested. The mean of the number of calories burned per hour was 544.8. Test the claim that the average number of calories burned is actually less than 546. Should the nuli hypothesis be rejected at a = 0.01? The standard deviation of the sample is 3. Can it be concluded that the average number of calories burned is less than onginally thought?​</h2><br />
