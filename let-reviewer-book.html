What’s a Critique?Read and analyze the information below then then summarize it using any of the summarizing techniques you have learned in Module 2. Use a separate one wholesheet of paper.Critiques evaluate and analyse a good type of things (texts, images, performances, etc.) supported by reasons or criteria. Sometimes, people equate the notion of “critique” to “criticism”, which sometimes suggests negative interpretation. These terms are easy to confuse, but let us be clear that critique and criticize don’t mean the identical thing. A negative critique may be said to be criticism within the way we frequently understand the term “to criticize”, but critiques are often positive too. We are all conversant in one among the foremost basic styles of critique: reviews (film reviews, music reviews, art reviews, book reviews, etc). Critiques within the style of reviews tend to possess a reasonably simple and particular point: whether or not something is “good” or “bad”.My Summary​</a>
