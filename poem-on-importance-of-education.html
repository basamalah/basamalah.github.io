A reader-response asks the reader to examine, explain and defend his/her personal reaction to a reading________2. Reader-response suggests that the role of the reader is essential to the meaning of a text or poetry, for only in the reading experience does the literary work come alive. ________ 3. When writing a reader-response, write as an educated adult addressing other adults or fellow scholars. ________ 4. There is no right or wrong answers to a reader-response. It is important that the critique should demonstrate his or her understanding of the text, book or reading and clearly explain their reactions with supporting details. ________5.. As a beginning scholar, if you write that something has nothing to do with you or does not pass your "Who cares?" test, but many other people think that it is important and great, readers will probably not agree with you that the text is dull or boring. ________6. Use limited quotes as examples of how it agrees with and supports what you think about the world, about right and wrong, and about what you think it is to be human.________7. As a beginning scholar, it is okay not to be cautious of criticizing any text or poem as "confusing" or "crazy," since readers might simply conclude that you are too ignorant or slow to understand and appreciate it.________8. Your "critique" can and should not be positive and not praise the text if possible, as well as pointing out problems, disagreements and shortcomings. ________9. Do NOT use quotes or examples to illustrate the quality of the text as art or entertainment.________ 10. In writing a response you may assume the reader has already read the text or poem. Thus, you can summarize the contents of the text at ength. Instead, take a systematic, analytical approach to the text.​</a>

In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.

In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.
