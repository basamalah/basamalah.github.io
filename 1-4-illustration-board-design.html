                                            Mr. Villamor was asked by his principal, Mrs. Mina, to transfer his Grade 9 class to a new
classroom in the second floor. The room however still does not have fixtures such as altar table, blackboard, bookshelf, bulletin board, learning stations, platform, teacher’s table and whiteboard. To
help him acquire these fixtures, he went to the Carpentry Shop of the school and found wood, plywood, nails, paints and many others. After all the materials have been gathered, he asked his friends, local amateur furniture
designers, to make designs of the different classroom needs. The designs shall be used by the
carpenter in constructing the altar table, blackboard, bookshelf, bulletin board, learning stations, platform, teacher’s table and whiteboard. It must be accurate, presentable and appropriate.
 1) Suppose you are one of the friends of Mr. Villamor. As a furniture designer, how will you
prepare the design of one of the fixtures?
2) Make a design of the fixture assigned to you.
 3) Illustrate every part or portion of the fixture including their measurements.
 4) Using the design of the fixture made, determine all the mathematics concepts or principles
involved like the perimeter and area to get the dimensions. 
5) Formulate problems involving these mathematics concepts or principles.
 6) Write the expressions or equations that describe the situations or problems. 
7) Solve the equations and the problems formulated. Aside from the design, your written output will be output will be evaluated based on
applications of the concepts of Quadratic Equation, accuracy of computation and effort.
