                                            II. TAKE MY ORDER Directions: Arrange the following paragraphs from A to E to form an introduction. A. Absenteeism among Fourth Year Students of Lipa City National High School ______1. In Lipa City National High School, about 6.34 percent or 60 out of 946 fourth year students are habitually absent during the month of August, September and October. _____2. The frequent absences of the students affect their academic performance therefore, in order to identify the possible causes of absences among fourth year students and to minimize truancy, the researcher conducts an investigation. _____3. Student absenteeism (McCluskey et. al., 2005) is a strong predictor of undesirable outcomes in adolescence, including academic failure, dropping out of school, substance abuse, gang involvement, and criminal activity. However, absenteeism is increasingly identified as an important "early warning sign" that a student is at risk for school failure and early dropout. ______4. As shown by the Guidance office records, a recorded number of absences everyday range to a total of 25 to 35 students. This is alarming on the part of the teachers and administrators since they are graduating students._____ 5. Absenteeism is a very alarming problem for administrators, teachers, parents and the society in general, as well as for the students in particular. As a result, students who are not able to finish their studies may end up as a liability of the community and the country as a whole.​</a>

Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

Absenteeism among Fourth Year Students of Lipa City National High School ______1. In Lipa City National High School, about 6.34 percent or 60 out of 946 fourth year students are habitually absent during the month of August, September and October. _____2. The frequent absences of the students affect their academic performance therefore, in order to identify the possible causes of absences among fourth year students and to minimize truancy, the researcher conducts an investigation. _____3. Student absenteeism (McCluskey et. al., 2005) is a strong predictor of undesirable outcomes in adolescence, including academic failure, dropping out of school, substance abuse, gang involvement, and criminal activity. However, absenteeism is increasingly identified as an important "early warning sign" that a student is at risk for school failure and early dropout. ______4. As shown by the Guidance office records, a recorded number of absences everyday range to a total of 25 to 35 students. This is alarming on the part of the teachers and administrators since they are graduating students._____ 5. Absenteeism is a very alarming problem for administrators, teachers, parents and the society in general, as well as for the students in particular. As a result, students who are not able to finish their studies may end up as a liability of the community and the country as a whole.​</h2><br />

                            5. Learning Task 3Read the argumentative essay that follows. Answer the given questions on the text boxesThe School Uniform Question1 Individualism in a fundamental part of society in many countries. Most people believe in the right to express their own opinion without fear of punishment. This value, however, is coming under fire in an unlikely place the public school classroom. The issue is school uniforms. Should public school students be allowed to make individual decisions about clothing, or should all students be required to wear a uniform? School uniforms are the better choice for three reasons2 First, wearing school uniforms would help make students' lives simpler. They would no longer have to decide what to wear every morning, sometimes trying on outfit after outfit in an effort to choose Uniforms would not only save time but also would eliminate the stressoften associated with this chore.Second, school uniforms influence students to act responsibly in groups and as individuals. Uniforms give students the message that school is a special place for learning. In addition, uniforms create a feeling of unity among students. For example, when students do something as a group, such as attend meetings in the auditorium or eat lunch in the cafeteria, the fact that they all wear the same uniform gives them a sense of community. Even more important, statistics show the positive effects that school uniforms have on violence and truancy. According to a recent survey in a large school district in Florida, incidents of school violence dropped by 30 percent, attendance and test scores improved, and student suspensions declined approximately 30 percent after school uniforms were introducedFinally, school uniforms would help make all the students feel equal. Students' standards of living differ greatly from family to family, and some people are well-off while others are not. People sometimes forget that school is a place to get an education, not to promote a "fashion show. Implementing mandatory school uniforms would make all the students look the same regardless of their financial status. School uniforms would promote pride and help to raise the self-esteem of students who cannot afford to wear expensive clothing3HEALTHY PERSONTransmission Probabilitywithout markTransmission ProbabilityLOWTransmission Probability LOWESTwith mask1.

Please be guided using this format. □ PROBLEM - A problem statement is a statement of a current issue or problem that requires timely action to improve the situation. Ex. What Causes Truancy Among Grade 10 Students? TITLE The title should be descriptive, direct, accurate, appropriate, interesting, concise, precise, unique, and should not be misleading. Ex. Causes of Truancy Among Grade 10 Students PURPOSE - The goal or purpose of a research is to bring together different views, evidence and facts about a topic. Ex. This mini-research aims to know the causes why Grade 10 students are becoming truant. IMPORTANCE - A successful topic selection should reveal the goal orientation of the research, that is, what kind of goals the research should achieve. Ex. The results of this mini-research will help alleviate cases of truancy among Grade 10 students. This will assist school administrators, teachers and parents to think of ways on how students can improve academically and behaviorally as they will now be more motivated to come to school regularly. POPULATION AND SAMPLE - A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. Ex. The target population in this mini-research are the Junior High School students of Sindalan High School. However due to some constraints, only 40(computation on how to compute sample size was discussed) Grade 10 students will be considered as the sample selected randomly through systematic sampling (sampling methods) RESULTS - Data presentation obtained from accurate computations, through tabular or graphical methods with corresponding interpretations. CONCLUSION - Drawing conclusions refers to information that is implied or inferred. This means that the information is never clearly stated. RECOMMENDATION - Recommendations are based on the results of your research and indicate the specific measures or direction that can be taken. Note : This will be recorded as PERFORMANCE TASK .
