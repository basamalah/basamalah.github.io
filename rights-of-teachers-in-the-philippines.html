                                            Something negative? I think most Philippine people are kinda too group oriented. Younotice right away most are comfortable following and agreeing what others think and say.It's weird but very refreshing to see those who are very individualistic in their destres,thoughts and actions.And the second one (promise, last one!), most can't seem to say 'NO. Too many are justtoo comfortable being people-pleasers - they would give practically everything includingtheir legs and arms just to help others (you know I'm just exaggerating, OK?). And yes, Ican wish most would just learn to always say 'No', and most people's lives in thePhilippines will be better.I don't wanna be academic with this particular reply.

                                            Jerome Espinosa Baladad, Born and raised in the Philippines where I stayeduntil reaching 40y.o.Updated December 29, 2019Thank you for asking.Something negative? I think most Philippine people are kinda too group oriented. Younotice right away most are comfortable following and agreeing what others think and say.It's weird but very refreshing to see those who are very individualistic in their destres,thoughts and actions.And the second one (promise, last one!), most can't seem to say 'NO. Too many are justtoo comfortable being people-pleasers - they would give practically everything includingtheir legs and arms just to help others (you know I'm just exaggerating, OK?). And yes, Ican wish most would just learn to always say 'No', and most people's lives in thePhilippines will be better.I don't wanna be academic with this particular reply.

                                            The experience of Cristina when she was in the province of Sorsogon could not be forgotten. Her father was a tricycle driver and her mother was a public teacher. They were four siblings in the family. With the meager income of her parents, they could just survive what they needed in their everyday life. They survived because of the determination of her parents to provide for their daily needs and education. As she was growing, Cristina would always wonder what could be the root cause/s of poverty and why to survive was a must. So, as a youth advocate of Amnesty International Philippines (AIPh), a non-profit organization with a global movement and programs for Human Rights Education, and Activism and Mobilization for its activist members, that aims to teach people of their basic human rights, in what way can you explain to her the possible roots of poverty that basically violate human rights? How would you empathize and be in solidarity with those unfortunate people and those in helpless situations? How would you let her be aware of the issue which could also be similar to the issue that the African nation is experiencing even up to the present time? pls answer this, i need it asap.​</a>

                            12. Jerome Espinosa Baladad, Born and raised in the Philippines where I stayeduntil reaching 40y.o.Updated December 29, 2019Thank you for asking.Something negative? I think most Philippine people are kinda too group oriented. Younotice right away most are comfortable following and agreeing what others think and say.It's weird but very refreshing to see those who are very individualistic in their destres,thoughts and actions.And the second one (promise, last one!), most can't seem to say 'NO. Too many are justtoo comfortable being people-pleasers - they would give practically everything includingtheir legs and arms just to help others (you know I'm just exaggerating, OK?). And yes, Ican wish most would just learn to always say 'No', and most people's lives in thePhilippines will be better.I don't wanna be academic with this particular reply.

                            28. The experience of Cristina when she was in the province of Sorsogon could not be forgotten. Her father was a tricycle driver and her mother was a public teacher. They were four siblings in the family. With the meager income of her parents, they could just survive what they needed in their everyday life. They survived because of the determination of her parents to provide for their daily needs and education. As she was growing, Cristina would always wonder what could be the root cause/s of poverty and why to survive was a must. So, as a youth advocate of Amnesty International Philippines (AIPh), a non-profit organization with a global movement and programs for Human Rights Education, and Activism and Mobilization for its activist members, that aims to teach people of their basic human rights, in what way can you explain to her the possible roots of poverty that basically violate human rights? How would you empathize and be in solidarity with those unfortunate people and those in helpless situations? How would you let her be aware of the issue which could also be similar to the issue that the African nation is experiencing even up to the present time? pls answer this, i need it asap.​</h2><br />
