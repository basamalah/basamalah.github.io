Assess your learning by answering the activity below. read text carefully to distinguish the main idea and supporting ideas, rewrite main idea and supporting ideas in your own words: follow the order of the ideas the way they appear in the original; restate complex ideas into ideas easy to understand; check if the parephrase written is the same as the ideas in the original but stated in your own words. Activity 1: Let's Restate! Directions: Rephrase the text below applying the aforementioned pointers. Paraphrase al Original As supplement to instruction, text materials may take the form of worksheets, study guides, or printed modules that are used in conjunction with video or voice technologies. It is important to note that the supplemental print materials may be disseminated via regular mail or over the internet. In addition, fax machines may be used also to transmit the print materials back and forth between the students and the teachers. With these materials, students have now the control on their study hours. However, there are still disadvantages in incorporating print materials.

It is important to note that the supplemental print materials may be disseminated via regular mail or over the internet. In addition, fax machines may be used also to transmit the print materials back and forth between the students and the teachers. With these materials, students have now the control on their study hours. However, there are still disadvantages in incorporating print materials.

                        <p>What I Have Learned You have learned in the previous discussion that Paraphrasing is is restating someone else's ideas using your own words and summary is a shortened version of a gist. Assess your learning by answering the activity below. read text carefully to distinguish the main idea and supporting ideas, rewrite main idea and supporting ideas in your own words: follow the order of the ideas the way they appear in the original; restate complex ideas into ideas easy to understand; check if the parephrase written is the same as the ideas in the original but stated in your own words.
