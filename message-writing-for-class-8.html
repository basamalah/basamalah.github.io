Create a folder named LastName_FirstName (ex. Diaz_Jess) in your local drive.2. Using NetBeans IDE, create a new project.3. Name the class as FactorialCalculator and save the project in your folder4. Write a simple factorial calculator program. The program should perform the following:Step 1. Ask the user to enter a positive integer.Step 2. Check if the entered integer is positive or negative. If it is positive, perform Step 3; otherwise,display an appropriate error message and the program should stop.Step 3. Calculate the factorial of the entered positive integer and display the result.Note: The factorial of n is denoted by n! and calculated by the product of integer numbersfrom 1 to n. For example, the entered integer is 5, the calculation of its factorial is: 5! = 1 ×2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120.Step 4. Repeat Step 1 to Step 3 five (5) times.5. Compile and execute the program.6. Debug syntax and logical errors if there is any in the program.7. The following is an example output:​</h2><br />
