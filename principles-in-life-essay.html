Life can be joyous, sorrowful, triumphant and full of adversity; all at once. Nevertheless, it is a journey worth taking and every moment should be treasured.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>you’ll know. The more that you know, the more places you’ll go.” — Dr. Seuss.</p><p></p><p>As any English-speaking child can tell you, there is no denying Dr. Seuss. If you love to read, but you’re a little afraid of reading a full-on novel in English, don’t worry. We’re going to help you get there, step by step.</p><p></p><p>With every book you read, the more you’ll improve your English reading skills.</p><p></p><p>To get started, there are some excellent novels written in English that are not too difficult to understand. Anyway, it’s good to set yourself a language challenge now and again. How else are you going to improve in English?</p><p></p><p>Reading is rewarding.</p><p>Being able to read a novel in another language and understand it is a huge achievement. You’ll feel accomplished the moment you read that final page, close the book, and reflect on the experience. You might find yourself at the last page faster than you thought—once you begin reading these books, you won’t be able to put them down.</p><p></p><p>Reading is an exercise in language learning.</p><p>Reading English novels will help improve your vocabulary, general understanding and in some cases it may even give you more knowledge into different countries and their cultures. You also get to move at your own pace. While listening to podcasts and radio, you have to keep up with whoever is speaking. Sure, watching movies to learn English can be a lot of fun, but doesn’t it get tiring to have to read subtitles or pause and rewind? While reading a book, you can read as slowly or as quickly as you desire. If you didn’t understand something, simply look at the paragraph again!</p><p></p><p>Reading opens the mind.</p><p>Reading educates. It opens you up to new experiences and perspectives. What better way is there to understand someone’s way of thinking? You may learn new information about language, culture, society, and history that you never knew before.</p><p></p><p>Reading is fun!</p><p>It is, overall, an enjoyable and relaxing way to learn English without any stress whatsoever. People get frustrated when they choose books that go above their reading levels. By choosing your first English books wisely, you should have a very positive experience.</p><p></p><p>If you enjoy this type of entertaining language learning, you can get a similar experience with FluentU.</p><p></p><p>FluentU takes real-world videos—like music videos, movie trailers, news and inspiring talks—and turns them into personalized language learning lessons.</p><p></p><p>Each video comes with interactive captions, so you can instantly get definitions for any unfamiliar words. There are also flashcards and exercises to help you remember them. So when you’re taking a break from one of the great books below, check out the FluentU free trial to keep learning while having fun!</p><p></p><p>10 Great and Easy English Books You Must Read</p><p>Check out some of the following well-known novels. If you’ve got a basic level of understanding and comprehension, these novels aren’t going to be a problem. They’re perfect for any learners who are learning English for beginners!</p><p></p><p>Set yourself a reading challenge. How many of these books can your read?</p><p></p><p>1. Charlotte’s Web – E.B.

                        <p>I would like to share to you several guiding principles which may have been influenced by my religion that I adhere to my life. Some of these principles are about love and the after life.  </p><p>Love is one of the greatest teachings of a Roman Catholic church. It's greatest form is how God the Father sent Jesus, his son to the world to be an example and representation of his love. He let his only son to come down here on earth, be born as a man in flesh and experience and do things like a human being. He can starve, hurt, experienced pain and death. We know his story and sufferings. We even heard some of his teachings and miracles. God sent him to us because he wants us to see and witness the real unconditional love. Even though it only means sufferings, Jesus and God agree to this idea if it only means to make us believe in their love.
</p><p>Another idea which I highly accepted from the Catholic church is the idea of the after life. There is a place for people who has their earthly body died. After their life here on earth, their body will be travelling in spirit to face Jesus for the Final Judgement. Of course nobody is born without being sinned. His body will undergo a cleansing process in Purgatory wherein he must pray for his sins and ask for redemption. It would be a great help for his soul's forgiveness if his living persons would also pray for him.  </p><p>Catholic principles are not that complicated and hard to understand. It is realistic and almost everything is supported by the bible, Saints and the church.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>"Religion: what does it mean to me?"</p><p></p><p>I have to admit that I am not a relgious person. I can't compare myself to devoted Christians of my generation,</p><p>I don't go to church. And I am just one of the many Christians who are just "Catholic" by name, but is actually less of catholic by deeds. </p><p></p><p>So with these testimonies, what does religion means to me? </p><p></p><p>Despite my detachment from the church, despite the gravity of my sins,</p><p>I still consider religion as a vessel of moral values, a spring of hope for the lost souls, and a haven for repentant sinners like me. </p><p></p><p>Relgion for me is the birthplace of my eternal life. It is the soil to which my faith is planted, it is the training ground for my Christian values, it is the threshold of my salvation. </p><p></p><p>Religion has once taught me the difference between right and wrong, the concept of good and evil, and the reasons for my existence in this ephemeral world.</p><p></p><p>One of the teachings that I learned in the Catholic Church is the commandment of Jesus. </p><p>Jesus' two commandments are as follows:</p><p>1. Love God above all </p><p>2. Love your neighbor as yourself</p><p>These two always go together and are unseparable, for we can only love God by loving our neighbor as ourselves. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />
