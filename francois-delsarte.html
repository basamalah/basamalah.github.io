Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful
politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second
largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to
understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.
Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it
begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first
humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska
sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some
people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward
along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually
covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were
settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the
last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before
Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages
were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which
consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the
Tuscarora.
In these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and
hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization.
According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada
shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and
Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes
as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.
The first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came
to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas
(Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they
eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).
After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator
came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second
group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE.
Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim
to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest
Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also
initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.
The first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534
and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis
I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By
the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages,
the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to
challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and
European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La
Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just
northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover
gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”
More French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According
to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de
Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site
Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United
States and Canada.

                                            Basahin ang kwento ni Tony Meloto, at ang kaniyang pagbahagi ng kaniyang karanasan sa pagsisimula ng GAWAD KALINGA, isang organisasyong tumutulong sa pagbibigay ng bahay na matitirhan para sa mga mahihirap. Matapos basahin ang kwento ay sagutin ang mga sumusunod na tanong. Si Tony Meloto ay ipinanganak noong Enero 17, 1950. Siya ay nag-aral ng isang taon sa De Anza School sa Richmond, California bilang isa American Field Service Scholar, at nagtapos naman ng Economics noong 1971 sa Ateneo de Manila bilang isang iskolar muli. Matapos nito, siya ay nagtrabaho bilang purchasing manager sa Proctor and Gamble. Tunay na naging maganda ang naging buhay ni Tony kahit pa ang kanilang pamilya ay hindi mayaman. Ang kanyang trabaho sa malaking kumpanya na tulad ng Proctor and Gamble ay di maikakailang sapat na upang magpaligaya sa kanya. Subalit, bakit niya isigawa ang ganitong proyekto, ang Gawad Kalinga? Taong 1985 nang maging aktibong kasapi ng Couples for Christ is Tony at doon ay mabilis syang umangat upang lider na naatasang magtayo ng Couples for Christ Family Ministries noon 1993. Nasali si Tony sa isang programa sa Bagong Silang, isang malaking lugar ng mga iskwater sa Metro Manila. Doon nakita ni Tony ang silbi ng kanyang buhay bilang tagapaglinkod ng Diyos. Ang mga iskwater sa Bagong Silang ay lubhang kulang sa pangunahing pangangailangang pisikal at espiritwal. At nabuo nga ang Gawad Kalinga, ngunit, ano ang layunin ni Tony Meloto sa pagsasagawa ng ganitong mga proyekto? Nakita ni Tony na hindi lamang dapat iahon mula sa kahirapan ang mga tao kundi kailangan din silang bigyan ng pag-asa sa pamamagitan ng pag-tanggal ng ‘slum mentality’ o ang pag- iisip na wala na silang ibang patutunguhan. Ang konsepto ng Gawad Kalinga ay ang paggawa ng bahay ng mahihirap at mga isponsor para sa mga mahihirap. Sa ngayon, marami nang organisasyon, korporasyon, at iba pang Samahan ang nakikiisa sa paggawa ng mga bahay. Ang isang kumpanya, halimbawa, na magiging isponsor, ay magpapadala ng mga tauhan nila sa isang lugar ng Gawad Kalinga at doon sila ay bubuo ng bahay: magbubuhos ng semento, magpipintura ng bahay, at kung anu-ano pa. Liban sa paggawa ng bahay, sinisikap din ng Gawad Kalinga na bigyang kabuhayan ang residente. May isang Gawad Kalinga na ang negosyo ng mga residente ay ang paggawa ng itlog na maalat. Bawat isang ‘village’ ng Gawad Kalinga ay may iba’t ibang paraan ng pagkakabuhayan. Ang pinakamahalaga sa lahat ay ang pagtulong sa mga residente na mamuhay bilang mga mahusay na Kristyano. Maraming boluntaryong nagtuturo sa bawat ‘village’ ng Gawad Kalinga di lamang ng akademya kundi ng pagiging tapat na Kristyano rin. Mula sa Gawad Kalinga ay umusbong rin ang SEED school, na naglalayon naman na papag-aralin ang mga kabataan na mula sa mahihirap na pamilya. Sabi nga ni Jean-François de Lavison, na nagtaguyod ng Ahimsa Fund, malaking tagumpay ang SEED school. Karamihan sa mga estudyante ay nagiging bihasa sa Ingles sa loob lamang ng ilang buwan. At ngayon nga ay pinaplano na ni Tony na makipagkaisa sa ilang ‘Culinary Schools’ para sa susunod na hakbang ng proyektong ito.

Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful
politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second
largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to
understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.
Canada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it
begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first
humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska
sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some
people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward
along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually
covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were
settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the
last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before
Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages
were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which
consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the
Tuscarora.
In these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and
hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization.
According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada
shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and
Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes
as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.
The first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came
to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas
(Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they
eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).
After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator
came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second
group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE.
Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim
to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest
Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also
initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.
The first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534
and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis
I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By
the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages,
the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to
challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and
European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La
Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just
northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover
gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”
More French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According
to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de
Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site
Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United
States and Canada.

                            21. Basahin ang kwento ni Tony Meloto, at ang kaniyang pagbahagi ng kaniyang karanasan sa pagsisimula ng GAWAD KALINGA, isang organisasyong tumutulong sa pagbibigay ng bahay na matitirhan para sa mga mahihirap. Matapos basahin ang kwento ay sagutin ang mga sumusunod na tanong. Si Tony Meloto ay ipinanganak noong Enero 17, 1950. Siya ay nag-aral ng isang taon sa De Anza School sa Richmond, California bilang isa American Field Service Scholar, at nagtapos naman ng Economics noong 1971 sa Ateneo de Manila bilang isang iskolar muli. Matapos nito, siya ay nagtrabaho bilang purchasing manager sa Proctor and Gamble. Tunay na naging maganda ang naging buhay ni Tony kahit pa ang kanilang pamilya ay hindi mayaman. Ang kanyang trabaho sa malaking kumpanya na tulad ng Proctor and Gamble ay di maikakailang sapat na upang magpaligaya sa kanya. Subalit, bakit niya isigawa ang ganitong proyekto, ang Gawad Kalinga? Taong 1985 nang maging aktibong kasapi ng Couples for Christ is Tony at doon ay mabilis syang umangat upang lider na naatasang magtayo ng Couples for Christ Family Ministries noon 1993. Nasali si Tony sa isang programa sa Bagong Silang, isang malaking lugar ng mga iskwater sa Metro Manila. Doon nakita ni Tony ang silbi ng kanyang buhay bilang tagapaglinkod ng Diyos. Ang mga iskwater sa Bagong Silang ay lubhang kulang sa pangunahing pangangailangang pisikal at espiritwal. At nabuo nga ang Gawad Kalinga, ngunit, ano ang layunin ni Tony Meloto sa pagsasagawa ng ganitong mga proyekto? Nakita ni Tony na hindi lamang dapat iahon mula sa kahirapan ang mga tao kundi kailangan din silang bigyan ng pag-asa sa pamamagitan ng pag-tanggal ng ‘slum mentality’ o ang pag- iisip na wala na silang ibang patutunguhan. Ang konsepto ng Gawad Kalinga ay ang paggawa ng bahay ng mahihirap at mga isponsor para sa mga mahihirap. Sa ngayon, marami nang organisasyon, korporasyon, at iba pang Samahan ang nakikiisa sa paggawa ng mga bahay. Ang isang kumpanya, halimbawa, na magiging isponsor, ay magpapadala ng mga tauhan nila sa isang lugar ng Gawad Kalinga at doon sila ay bubuo ng bahay: magbubuhos ng semento, magpipintura ng bahay, at kung anu-ano pa. Liban sa paggawa ng bahay, sinisikap din ng Gawad Kalinga na bigyang kabuhayan ang residente. May isang Gawad Kalinga na ang negosyo ng mga residente ay ang paggawa ng itlog na maalat. Bawat isang ‘village’ ng Gawad Kalinga ay may iba’t ibang paraan ng pagkakabuhayan. Ang pinakamahalaga sa lahat ay ang pagtulong sa mga residente na mamuhay bilang mga mahusay na Kristyano. Maraming boluntaryong nagtuturo sa bawat ‘village’ ng Gawad Kalinga di lamang ng akademya kundi ng pagiging tapat na Kristyano rin. Mula sa Gawad Kalinga ay umusbong rin ang SEED school, na naglalayon naman na papag-aralin ang mga kabataan na mula sa mahihirap na pamilya. Sabi nga ni Jean-François de Lavison, na nagtaguyod ng Ahimsa Fund, malaking tagumpay ang SEED school. Karamihan sa mga estudyante ay nagiging bihasa sa Ingles sa loob lamang ng ilang buwan. At ngayon nga ay pinaplano na ni Tony na makipagkaisa sa ilang ‘Culinary Schools’ para sa susunod na hakbang ng proyektong ito. Ilan sa mga Tony Meloto quotes ay, “The older I get the more I want to work with the young who teach me how to dare." [Habang ako ay tumatanda, lalong umiigting ang aking pagnanais na makatrabaho ang mga kabataan na tinuturuan ako na maglakas loob] Sa edad na 50, maigting pa rin ang apoy ng pagtulong sa puso ni Tony Meloto.a. Ano ang nagtulak sa kaniya upang simulan ang Gawad Kalinga at iwan ang kaniyang trabaho? b. Paano niya sinimulan ang Gawad Kalinga? c. Ano ang nagpapatatag sa kaniya upang ipagpatuloy ang kaniyang gawain? d. Bakit niya isinagawa ang ganitong mga proyekto? e. Ano ang maituturing mong pinakamagandang impluwensiya sa iyo ng iyong nabasang kwento? Ipaliwanag.​</h2><br />
