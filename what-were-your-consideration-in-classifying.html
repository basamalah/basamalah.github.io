Time. I must consider the best time where I would conduct my studies. A good time could help you be more productive. Setting a time would help you manage your time wisely throughout the day. And most of us have different adequate study times; you could be an early riser who could focus more during the morning, while some were more productive during the evening right before bed. Finding out what time works for you is the best way to start to form a study habit.</p><p></p><p>2. Place. The environment you were in could influence how your studying would go.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Study habits are the behavioral practices of students towards their studies. Every student has his or her own study habit. Study habits are habits that include memorizing, reading, advance knowledge to a lesson and etc. And these study habits are seen before every quiz, recitation or exams. But during these activities, most students forget what were the things that they have studied. That leads them to cheat by looking to their seat mate’s paper or by looking into their notes. And for example after the exam there are just three things that could possibly happened. Its either they will pass the exam, fail to pass or their teacher will found out that they cheated during the exam.</p><p></p><p>Good study habits mean good performance and there’s a chance to be an achiever more likely to be the first honor of that particular batch. Poor study habits leads to poor performance in academics and he or she might fail on exams. Those who have good study habits are the ones who are successful in life because of their high grades.

                            30. 1. What were your considerations in classifying your study habits?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:
</p><p>I would consider three things: time, place, and materials.
</p><p>Explanation:
</p><p>To have the best study habits, I must consider a few things that would possibly affect it, such as the following:
</p><p>1.	Time. I must consider the best time where I would conduct my studies. A good time could help you be more productive. Setting a time would help you manage your time wisely throughout the day. And most of us have different adequate study times; you could be an early riser who could focus more during the morning, while some were more productive during the evening right before bed. Finding out what time works for you is the best way to start to form a study habit.
</p><p>2.	Place. The environment you were in could influence how your studying would go. Too much distraction in an environment wouldn’t help you focus on what you’re supposed to be doing. Finding a good study spot where you could exercise more focus is the best factor to have a good studying time.
</p><p>3.	Materials. What study materials you have on hand are best to be considered. Having a good number of materials you can use could make your study time more convenient and fluid. You could consider using many different materials, such as notes, printed handouts, online softcopies, online video tutorials, books, and even pens, pencils, and papers.
