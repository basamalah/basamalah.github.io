This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​</a>

Cutting Plane line is a fine line used to show the part of the object being cut. 3. Section Line is an imaginary line along which shows where an object is imagined cut to obtain a sectional view. 4. Section lines indicate the solid areas of a part. 5. Section line indicates the material from which a part is made. 6. Half Section is a type of sectional view that shows the entire cut surface of the view. 7. Full Section is a resulting view when the cutting plane is imagined at half-way across the object. 8. Broken-out Section is a type of view when there is portion of the view being taken out. 9. Revolved Section is a type of section applied to a circular object. The resulting view is similar to full section view. 10. Removed Section is generally used in furniture, machine, and architectural drawing. The appearance of the sectional view depends on the location of the cutting - plane lines. 11. Offset Section shows the zigzag direction of the cutting plane if the principal interior features of an object are not located in a straight line, it is necessary to offset the cutting - plane line to allow to pass through as many of the principal features of the object. 12.Assembly Section is a made up of a combination of the parts of all other section drawings. This section may be used to increase the clarity and readability of assembly drawings. 13.Sectioning shows more detailed illustration particularly on the internal parts of the object. 14.Section lines is an inclined line that forms 45 degrees angle. Each line must have at least 2mm distance from each other. 15.The direction of the cutting plane line is a major reference to consider in determining the form of view to be drawn. -​</a>

A detail drawing provides a detailed description of an object. A detail drawing is a tool used by engineers to communicate their designs to manufacturers and to preserve their work for future generations. d. All of the choices are correct. C.I. TRUE or FALSE Instruction: Write the whole word TRUE if you agree with the statement while FALSE if not. Write your answer on the blank space provided. (Please use this paper as your answer sheet) 1. In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​​</a>

(Please use this paper as your answer sheet) 1. In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​</h2><br />

Write your answers on the provided answer sheet found at the end of the learning activity sheets 1. Sectional view is purposely drawn to show the inside portion of the object. 2. Cutting Plane line is a fine line used to show the part of the object being cut. 3. Section Line is an imaginary line along which shows where an object is imagined cut to obtain a sectional view. 4. Section lines indicate the solid areas of a part. 5. Section line indicates the material from which a part is made. 6. Half Section is a type of sectional view that shows the entire cut surface of the view. 7. Full Section is a resulting view when the cutting plane is imagined at half-way across the object. 8. Broken-out Section is a type of view when there is portion of the view being taken out. 9. Revolved Section is a type of section applied to a circular object. The resulting view is similar to full section view. 10. Removed Section is generally used in furniture, machine, and architectural drawing. The appearance of the sectional view depends on the location of the cutting - plane lines. 11. Offset Section shows the zigzag direction of the cutting plane if the principal interior features of an object are not located in a straight line, it is necessary to offset the cutting - plane line to allow to pass through as many of the principal features of the object. 12.Assembly Section is a made up of a combination of the parts of all other section drawings. This section may be used to increase the clarity and readability of assembly drawings. 13.Sectioning shows more detailed illustration particularly on the internal parts of the object. 14.Section lines is an inclined line that forms 45 degrees angle. Each line must have at least 2mm distance from each other. 15.The direction of the cutting plane line is a major reference to consider in determining the form of view to be drawn. -​</h2><br />

A Sectional view should be regarded as a tool to help clarify a multiview drawing22. When shafts, bolts, pins, nuts, rods, etc., appear in a sectional view they should not usaily be section lined.23. Phantom section shows all the external features and all the original hidden lines.24. Removed section is the same as a revolved section, except for its placement on the paper.15. Revolved section is used to show the cross section of beams, spokes, pins, etc.26. A half section results when the entire ciew is shown in section27. A full section shows both internal and external features, not necessarily in equal proportions.28. Phantom section is used when we need to have only part of the object in sectional view.29. Assembly section eliminates the hidden lines in a complex view and better describes the interior features.30. The different parts of removed sections are distinguished by section lines that are inclined in different directions.​</h2><br />

                            29. a. 18. What's fact about detail drawing? Detail drawings are created on standard paper sizes. b. A detail drawing provides a detailed description of an object. A detail drawing is a tool used by engineers to communicate their designs to manufacturers and to preserve their work for future generations. d. All of the choices are correct. C.I. TRUE or FALSE Instruction: Write the whole word TRUE if you agree with the statement while FALSE if not. Write your answer on the blank space provided. (Please use this paper as your answer sheet) 1. In the General Assembly drawings, all parts are drawn in their working position. This includes orthographic drawings of assembled products, parts lists, and related data needed in manufacturing process.2. An Assembly drawing conveys the completed shape of the product, overall dimensions, relative position of each part and the functional relationship among various components. 3. Working drawings are composed according to industry standards so that all the information is easily and clearly understood, and standard conventions and units are used. 4. There are two distinctive types of working drawings; the Detail and Assembly drawings. 5. A Detail Assembly drawing shows how all components are assembled and provides all the necessary details, dimensions and joining techniques to fully assemble all or part of the project. 6. Exploded, General, Layout, Detail Assembly drawings are examples of a Detail Working drawings 7. In the Layout Assembly drawing, the parts are separately displayed, but they are aligned according to their assembly positions and sequences. 8. The Exploded assembly drawing shows rough preliminary design ideas sometimes in a sketch form. 9. A Detail Assembly drawing has several detailed drawings within it. 10. Working drawings are drawings used as a reference or guide in the manufacture of a product. 11. Half Section is obtained when the cutting-plane extends entirely through the object in a straight line and the front half of the object is totally. 12. Full Section refers to one quart of the object to be cut or removed. 13. In constructing Assembly Drawings, if there are intemal assemblies, sectional views should be used. 14. Sectional view is a method of drawing presentation showing the interior part part of the building especially when the inner parts are complicated. 15. Dimensions in detailed drawing should be shown clearly.​​</h2><br />
