                                            Situation 1: Pedro is a Grade 10 student from an urban place in the country. His family is living in a small room made of recycled materials , tarps, and cheap wood. Early in the moming as he goes to school, he needs to walk along a muddy "eskinita " since it rained hard the night before. This is common to their place since there is no proper drainage systems. On his way to school , he saw two kids peeing in pots because toilets are few and communal, and they sometimes need to pay for using it. Most kids in their area do not go to school anymore and their parents are always out working in the nearby factories, leaving their children unsupervised and most of the time unfed. This made the children malnourished and suffer respiratory problems and skin diseases. This is the usual Monday morning to Pedro. Despite all these things, Pedro is determined to finish his schooling and excited to reach all his future ambitions and plans Essential Questions : 1. What are the problems that were described in the story? List three. 2. What are the effects of these problems in people's health, nutrition, and well-being?PATULONG NA MN PO!​</a>

                            7. Situation 1: Pedro is a Grade 10 student from an urban place in the country. His family is living in a small room made of recycled materials , tarps, and cheap wood. Early in the moming as he goes to school, he needs to walk along a muddy "eskinita " since it rained hard the night before. This is common to their place since there is no proper drainage systems. On his way to school , he saw two kids peeing in pots because toilets are few and communal, and they sometimes need to pay for using it. Most kids in their area do not go to school anymore and their parents are always out working in the nearby factories, leaving their children unsupervised and most of the time unfed. This made the children malnourished and suffer respiratory problems and skin diseases. This is the usual Monday morning to Pedro. Despite all these things, Pedro is determined to finish his schooling and excited to reach all his future ambitions and plans Essential Questions : 1. What are the problems that were described in the story? List three. 2. What are the effects of these problems in people's health, nutrition, and well-being?PATULONG NA MN PO!​</h2><br />

I would use the hatchet to cut down bamboo and palm fronds for building materials and to start a fire. I would use the rubbing alcohol for cleaning wounds and sterilizing equipment. I would also use the can of vegetable oil to cook food and as a source of energy.
