I’ve known this since before I could go to school. As a toddler, my first study materials were a set of flash cards that my mother used to teach me the English alphabet.My mother made home conducive to learning English: all my storybooks and coloring books were in English, and so were the cartoons I watched and the music I listened to. She required me to speak English at home. She even hired tutors to help me learn to read and write in English.In school I learned to think in English. We used English to learn about numbers, equations and variables. With it we learned about observation and inference, the moon and the stars, monsoons and photosynthesis. With it we learned about shapes and colors, about meter and rhythm. I learned about God in English, and I prayed to Him in English.Filipino, on the other hand, was always the “other” subject – almost a special subject like PE or Home Economics, except that it was graded the same way as Science, Math, Religion and English. My classmates and I used to complain about Filipino all the time. Filipino was a chore, like washing the dishes; it was not the language of learning. It was the language we used to speak to the people who washed our dishes.We used to think learning Filipino was important because it was practical: Filipino was the language of the world outside the classroom. It was the language of the streets: it was how you spoke to the tindera when you went to the tindahan, what you used to tell your katulong that you had an utos, and how you texted manong when you needed “sundo na" These skills were required to survive in the outside world, because we are forced to relate with the tinderas and the manongs and the katulongs of this world. If we wanted to communicate to these people – or otherwise avoid being mugged on the jeepney – we needed to learn Filipino.That being said though, I was proud of my proficiency with the language. Filipino was the language I used to speak with my cousins and uncles and grandparents in the province, so I never had much trouble reciting.It was the reading and writing that was tedious and difficult. I spoke Filipino, but only when I was in a different world like the streets or the province; it did not come naturally to me. English was more natural; I read, wrote and thought in English. And so, in much of the same way that I learned German later on, I learned Filipino in terms of English. In this way I survived Filipino in high school, albeit with too many sentences that had the preposition “ay.”It was really only in university that I began to grasp Filipino in terms of language and not just dialect. Filipino was not merely a peculiar variety of language, derived and continuously borrowing from the English and Spanish alphabets; it was its own system, with its own grammar, semantics, sounds, even symbols.But more significantly, it was its own way of reading, writing and thinking. There are ideas and concepts unique to Filipino that can never be translated into another. Try translating bayanihan, tagay, kilig or diskarte.Only recently have I begun to grasp Filipino as the language of identity: the language of emotion, experience, and even of learning. And with this comes the realization that I do, in fact, smell worse than a malansang isda. My own language is foreign to me: I speak, think, read and write primarily in English. To borrow the terminology of Fr. Bulatao, I am a split-level Filipino.But perhaps this is not so bad in a society of rotten beef and stinking fish. For while Filipino may be the language of identity, it is the language of the streets. It might have the capacity to be the language of learning, but it is not the language of the learned.
It is neither the language of the classroom and the laboratory, nor the language of the boardroom, the court room, or the operating room. It is not the language of privilege. I may be disconnected from my being Filipino, but with a tongue of privilege I will always have my connections.So, I have my education to thank for making English mother touge Main PointsTextual EvidenceFact or Opinion1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4​</a>

“Be proud of being a Filipino (even if it is not easy)” 
From INQUIRER.net / 04:50 PM June 12, 2015 
– Jen Denielle R. Hernandez, Grade 9 
What is the best the thing I have done for my country? I actually don’t know because at my age, it is impossible to do something big. Then I realized it isn’t 
important on how big it is. I think the best thing I’ve done for my country is to be proud that I am a Filipino. 
Being proud that I am a Filipino is not quite easy. Sometimes, I even doubt it because of our government. The people have to rally on the streets to get what they want. I feel like it is telling me that we have to go to war first before we can gain peace. When I was in Grade 7, we studied Philippine history. I then appreciated peace. It was not just about the Filipinos fighting the Spanish but how we fought for our independence. 
Now, if someone will ask me what is the best thing that I have done for our country, I will tell him or her that I am proud to be a Filipino.

1. What is the best thing that the writer has done for the country? ________________________________________________________________

English language. Why? 2Here are several reasons. 3First our teacher in English
inspires us to do our best because she prepares and teaches our lessons in the
English language as well. 4Second, all the other teachers speak to us in English
in all zones of the campus, except during our classes in Filipino and Social
Studies. 5Another is that we are exposed to many activities in which we can

the laboratory. 6We also have contests in declamation, oral reading and

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sample - A sample is just a part of a population. For example, let's say your population was every American, and you wanted to find out how much the average person earns. Time and finances stop you from knocking on every door in America, so you choose to ask 1,000 random people. This one thousand people are your sample.
</p><p>
</p><p>Population - is the number of people or animals in a particular place. An example of population is over eight million people living in New York City. The people living within a political or geographical boundary.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. All learners who are enrolled during this pandemic should be given passing  grades.
</p><p>OPINION: I DISAGREE, because giving passing grades to students does means giving them the rights to not strive harder this academic year and just do their work as they please and let their education be just compensation to say that they did something, because that's how it is. What about education if it becomes meaningless for students, just for me to follow the norm and give what is due for any student.  </p><p>2. Parents of the learners enrolled during this pandemic should also be given  compensation or allowance.
</p><p>OPINION: I AGREE, it maybe the parents or the learners, allowance is every family desperately needs it now, it is not easy to study and educate now and even the help that comes from the government or the NGO's for the education of students is a huge contribution.
</p><p>3. The anti-COVID-19 vaccines should cater all Filipino people regardless of
</p><p>age and status in life.
</p><p>OPINION: I AGREE, this vaccines is designed to provide resistance against the spread of Covid 19 and as a citizen regardless of your state of life, you have the right to be vaccinated. As for a person's age, there is a vaccine for their age and that is according to the health organizations. With that, I can conclude that Covid 19 vaccines should cater filipino people regardless of who they are.
</p><p>4. Schools should not be used as evacuation centers anymore.
</p><p>OPINION: I DISAGREE, the question is when can schools no longer be evacuation centers does the government have an alternative place to live for people who have experienced the disaster? Maybe if there was a better replacement for it, they would have replaced it, but the fact that schools are more reliable place for people to live in, right now, we should not have this idea first unless we have alternative for schools as evacuation centers right?
</p><p>5. Modular/ digital distance learning is the best modality to be used during
</p><p>pandemic</p><p>OPINION: I AGREE, as the Philippines being one of the countries with very weak internet connection, modular learning program is the best learning alternative because a module is  defined as a unit, chapter, topic, or segment of instruction. the instruction for learning is more intact in modules </p><p>than in online learning that usually having a connection problem that causes the incoming lesson to be interrupted or the teacher tells the student. More than that, it can be said that in modular learning, self -awareness and extensive reading can further enhance a student's critical thinking and knowledge. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>smile:)</p><br />

It is my belief that if we all just work together, especially the community, then we will be able to attain this aspiration. However, because of so many challenges, the way to success is not that easy to accomplish. There are so many factors like distractions, lack of time for the parents to teach their children, the inability of the parents to teach reading, and a lot more.</p><p></p><p>       I feel pity for those children who do not have a strong support system.

I’ve known this since before I could go to school. As a toddler, my first study materials were a set of flash cards that my mother used to teach me the English alphabet.My mother made home conducive to learning English: all my storybooks and coloring books were in English, and so were the cartoons I watched and the music I listened to. She required me to speak English at home. She even hired tutors to help me learn to read and write in English.In school I learned to think in English. We used English to learn about numbers, equations and variables. With it we learned about observation and inference, the moon and the stars, monsoons and photosynthesis. With it we learned about shapes and colors, about meter and rhythm. I learned about God in English, and I prayed to Him in English.Filipino, on the other hand, was always the “other” subject – almost a special subject like PE or Home Economics, except that it was graded the same way as Science, Math, Religion and English. My classmates and I used to complain about Filipino all the time. Filipino was a chore, like washing the dishes; it was not the language of learning. It was the language we used to speak to the people who washed our dishes.We used to think learning Filipino was important because it was practical: Filipino was the language of the world outside the classroom. It was the language of the streets: it was how you spoke to the tindera when you went to the tindahan, what you used to tell your katulong that you had an utos, and how you texted manong when you needed “sundo na" These skills were required to survive in the outside world, because we are forced to relate with the tinderas and the manongs and the katulongs of this world. If we wanted to communicate to these people – or otherwise avoid being mugged on the jeepney – we needed to learn Filipino.That being said though, I was proud of my proficiency with the language. Filipino was the language I used to speak with my cousins and uncles and grandparents in the province, so I never had much trouble reciting.It was the reading and writing that was tedious and difficult. I spoke Filipino, but only when I was in a different world like the streets or the province; it did not come naturally to me. English was more natural; I read, wrote and thought in English. And so, in much of the same way that I learned German later on, I learned Filipino in terms of English. In this way I survived Filipino in high school, albeit with too many sentences that had the preposition “ay.”It was really only in university that I began to grasp Filipino in terms of language and not just dialect. Filipino was not merely a peculiar variety of language, derived and continuously borrowing from the English and Spanish alphabets; it was its own system, with its own grammar, semantics, sounds, even symbols.But more significantly, it was its own way of reading, writing and thinking. There are ideas and concepts unique to Filipino that can never be translated into another. Try translating bayanihan, tagay, kilig or diskarte.Only recently have I begun to grasp Filipino as the language of identity: the language of emotion, experience, and even of learning. And with this comes the realization that I do, in fact, smell worse than a malansang isda. My own language is foreign to me: I speak, think, read and write primarily in English. To borrow the terminology of Fr. Bulatao, I am a split-level Filipino.But perhaps this is not so bad in a society of rotten beef and stinking fish. For while Filipino may be the language of identity, it is the language of the streets. It might have the capacity to be the language of learning, but it is not the language of the learned.
It is neither the language of the classroom and the laboratory, nor the language of the boardroom, the court room, or the operating room. It is not the language of privilege. I may be disconnected from my being Filipino, but with a tongue of privilege I will always have my connections.So, I have my education to thank for making English mother touge Main PointsTextual EvidenceFact or Opinion1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4.5.1.2.3.4​</h2><br />

“Be proud of being a Filipino (even if it is not easy)” 
From INQUIRER.net / 04:50 PM June 12, 2015 
– Jen Denielle R. Hernandez, Grade 9 
What is the best the thing I have done for my country? I actually don’t know because at my age, it is impossible to do something big. Then I realized it isn’t 
important on how big it is. I think the best thing I’ve done for my country is to be proud that I am a Filipino. 
Being proud that I am a Filipino is not quite easy. Sometimes, I even doubt it because of our government. The people have to rally on the streets to get what they want. I feel like it is telling me that we have to go to war first before we can gain peace. When I was in Grade 7, we studied Philippine history. I then appreciated peace. It was not just about the Filipinos fighting the Spanish but how we fought for our independence. 
Now, if someone will ask me what is the best thing that I have done for our country, I will tell him or her that I am proud to be a Filipino.

TEXT: 1We, the Grade 5 pupils in my school, are now better speakers of the
English language. Why? 2Here are several reasons. 3First our teacher in English
inspires us to do our best because she prepares and teaches our lessons in the
English language as well. 4Second, all the other teachers speak to us in English
in all zones of the campus, except during our classes in Filipino and Social
Studies. 5Another is that we are exposed to many activities in which we can
practice speaking well, not to mention being serious in our speech class held in
the laboratory. 6We also have contests in declamation, oral reading and
interpretative reading.
