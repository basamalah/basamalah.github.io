Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

Economic Management MULTIPLE CHOICE A large group of people with similar economic attributes that shape their lifestyles and life chances is called a(n) interest group. class. subculture. human capital. economic unit. Whose concept of class was based primarily on how money was made rather than simply on how much money was made? Max Weber Mohammad Khatami Harold Lasswell Karl Marx Pavan Varma The structure of an economy based on the methods of production, patterns of property ownership, and relations between workers and owners is the level of economic development. mode of production. gross domestic product. political economy. means of production. The bourgeoisie is defined by Marx as the wealthiest and most powerful members of society. common, boorish, unsophisticated people. those who use, but do not own, the means of production. service workers, white collar managers, and civil servants. owners of the means of production. The proletariat is defined by Marx as those who use, but do not own, the means of production. the poorest individuals in society. owners of the means of production. common, boorish, unsophisticated people. service workers, white collar managers, and civil servants. The old middle class refers to the wealthiest people in a country. small business owners who possess the means of production. manual laborers and unskilled workers. anyone who works hard for a living. service workers, white collar managers, and civil servants. The new middle class refers to those who own the means of production. manual laborers and minimum-wage employees. those who use, but do not own, the means of production. all people with steady employment outside of the most senior management. service workers, white collar managers, and civil servants. In a post-industrial, economically developed country, the majority of the population falls into the upper class. bourgeoisie. middle class. working class. underclass. What is the term for the income level that half of the population falls below and half of the population falls above? Average income Per capita gross domestic product Purchasing power parity Median income Gross national product The purpose of presenting economic data in constant dollars is to control for increased value due to inflation. control for the value of different currency. present data in the actual market value of the currency being studied. take into account the cost of living in a given country. take into account the distribution of wealth among a countryâs population. Which best describes a key difference between gross national product (GNP) and gross domestic product (GDP)? GDP is the value of all the goods and services that citizens of a state produce, whether they live inside the country or abroad; GNP is the sum of all goods and services produced within the borders of a particular state, whether by citizens or not. GNP is the value of all the goods and services that citizens of a state produce, whether they live inside the country or abroad; GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced within the borders of a particular state, whether by citizens or not. GNP is the value of all the goods and services that citizens of a state produce, whether they live inside the country or abroad; GDP is that number divided by the number of people in that state. GDP is the value of all the goods and services that citizens of a state produce, whether they live inside the country or abroad; GNP is that number divided by the number of people in that state. GNP is the sum of all goods and services produced within the borders of a particular state, whether by citizens or not; GDP adjusts that for comparative purposes by comparing how much one can purchase with the same amount of money in different countries. Purchasing power parity is aimed at adjusting statistics based on the size of a countryâs population. the overall wealth or poverty of a country. how much one can purchase with the same amount of money in different countries. the distribution of wealth among a countryâs population. economic activity of Americans living abroad and noncitizens living in the United States. Most newly industrialized countries (NICs) are found in Asia. the Middle East. Central America. Eastern Europe. Africa. The economic activity of lesser developed countries (LDCs) is often concentrated in agricultural industries and extraction processes for raw materials. service industries such as call centers and tourism. light manufacturing such as textiles factories. heavy manufacturing such as automobile plants. high-tech manufacturing such as production of computer chips or petro-chemicals. The postcommunist states are typically referred to as economically developed countries. lesser developed countries. countries in transition. newly industrialized countries. emerging market countries. The emerging market countries are found primarily among which types of countries? Both economically developed countries and newly ind</h2><br />

                            15. Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.
