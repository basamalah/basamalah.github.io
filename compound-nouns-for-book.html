                                            Previously, you were introduced and taught of what a personal pronoun is and how it’s
different from an indefinite pronoun. In this part of the module, you are again to learn more
about pronouns. These are the interrogative and relative pronouns. Again, let us continue
doing the activities here.
INTERROGATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS
Interrogative pronoun is in a question. It helps to ask about something.
Interrogative pronouns are, what, which, who, whom, and whose.
Examples:
● What on earth is that?
● What do you want for dinner?
● Which color do you prefer?
● Which seat would you lie?
● Who is going to take out the trash?
● Who was driving the car?
● Whom do you prefer to vote for?
● Whom do you live with?
● Whose sweater is that?
● Whose parents are those?
Relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The most
common relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, and that. Sometimes when and where
can be used as relative pronouns as well. Relative pronoun is placed directly after the noun it
modifies.

Examples:
● The driver, who ran the stop sign. was careless.
● The children, whom we love dearly, need better educations.
● I have a friend whose cat is adorable.
● The book, which is now out of print, has all the information you need.
● This is the book that everyone is talking about.
In each example above, the subject of the sentence is described by a relative clause (italicized).
As these clauses describe a noun, they are also known as adjective clauses, because they act
like adjectives in the sentence. Each clause is introduced by a relative pronoun (in bold).
Relative pronouns connect the description to the rest of the sentence in an orderly way.
In the first sentence, the relative pronoun who together with the other words, “who ran the stop
sign”
is a relative clause that describes the driver, thus, the clause is used as an adjective for it
describes the noun, driver.
The same with the second sentence, the relative pronoun whom with the other words, “whom we
love dearly”, as the relative clause and as an adjective clause describes the noun children. In
the third sentence, “whose cat is adorable” modifies the noun friend. In the fourth sentence,
“which is now out of print” modifies the noun book, and in the last sentence, “that everyone is
talking about describes the noun book.

Interrogative Pronouns
An interrogative pronoun is used in a question. It helps ask about something or someone.
The interrogative pronouns are: what, which, who, whom, and compound words ending
in “ever,” such as, whatever, whichever, whoever, and whomever.
Examples:
What on earth is that? Who ate the last fig Newton?
An interrogative pronoun may look like an interrogative adjective, but it is used differently
in a sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Indefinite Pronouns
An indefinite pronoun refers to an indefinite, or general, person or thing. Indefinite
pronouns include all, any, both, each, everyone, few, many, neither, none, nothing,
several, some, and somebody.
Examples:
Something smells good. Many like salsa with their chips.
An indefinite pronoun may look like an indefinite adjective, but it is used differently in a
sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Relative Pronouns
A relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The
relative pronouns are that, which, who, and whom.
Examples:
You should bring the book that you love most.
That introduces “you love most,” which describes the book.

                            4. Previously, you were introduced and taught of what a personal pronoun is and how it’s
different from an indefinite pronoun. In this part of the module, you are again to learn more
about pronouns. These are the interrogative and relative pronouns. Again, let us continue
doing the activities here.
INTERROGATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS
Interrogative pronoun is in a question. It helps to ask about something.
Interrogative pronouns are, what, which, who, whom, and whose.
Examples:
● What on earth is that?
● What do you want for dinner?
● Which color do you prefer?
● Which seat would you lie?
● Who is going to take out the trash?
● Who was driving the car?
● Whom do you prefer to vote for?
● Whom do you live with?
● Whose sweater is that?
● Whose parents are those?
Relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The most
common relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, and that. Sometimes when and where
can be used as relative pronouns as well. Relative pronoun is placed directly after the noun it
modifies.
7
Examples:
● The driver, who ran the stop sign. was careless.
● The children, whom we love dearly, need better educations.
● I have a friend whose cat is adorable.
● The book, which is now out of print, has all the information you need.
● This is the book that everyone is talking about.
In each example above, the subject of the sentence is described by a relative clause (italicized).
As these clauses describe a noun, they are also known as adjective clauses, because they act
like adjectives in the sentence. Each clause is introduced by a relative pronoun (in bold).
Relative pronouns connect the description to the rest of the sentence in an orderly way.
In the first sentence, the relative pronoun who together with the other words, “who ran the stop
sign”
is a relative clause that describes the driver, thus, the clause is used as an adjective for it
describes the noun, driver.
The same with the second sentence, the relative pronoun whom with the other words, “whom we
love dearly”, as the relative clause and as an adjective clause describes the noun children. In
the third sentence, “whose cat is adorable” modifies the noun friend. In the fourth sentence,
“which is now out of print” modifies the noun book, and in the last sentence, “that everyone is
talking about describes the noun book.

Interrogative Pronouns
An interrogative pronoun is used in a question. It helps ask about something or someone.
The interrogative pronouns are: what, which, who, whom, and compound words ending
in “ever,” such as, whatever, whichever, whoever, and whomever.
Examples:
What on earth is that? Who ate the last fig Newton?
An interrogative pronoun may look like an interrogative adjective, but it is used differently
in a sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Indefinite Pronouns
An indefinite pronoun refers to an indefinite, or general, person or thing. Indefinite
pronouns include all, any, both, each, everyone, few, many, neither, none, nothing,
several, some, and somebody.
Examples:
Something smells good. Many like salsa with their chips.
An indefinite pronoun may look like an indefinite adjective, but it is used differently in a
sentence: it acts as a pronoun, taking the place of a noun.
Relative Pronouns
A relative pronoun introduces a clause, or part of a sentence, that describes a noun. The
relative pronouns are that, which, who, and whom.
Examples:
You should bring the book that you love most.
That introduces “you love most,” which describes the book.
