                                            what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</a>

                            20. what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</h2><br />
