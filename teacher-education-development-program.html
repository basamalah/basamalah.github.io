"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

Complete the table by writing thestatements that fall under fact, judgement and actionThe K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providingsufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, producelifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurshipand employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added twoyears of Senior High School (SHS) The courses that can be learned from SHS includeaccounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary andhospitality workAlthough the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there isstil a mismatch between our schooling system and working system As regards theimplementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materialsprovided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materialsfor one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack ofsufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem.Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers aswell. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with theimplementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016.Despite these observations, Department of Education (DEPED) is optimistic that theseshortages and problems will overcame as they claim that these are being addressedMeanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) laudeDepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its Chairman, additional twoyears of education should not be seen as a burden.(Barrot, 2016, p. 92)FACTJUDGEMENTACTION​pa helpp!</a>

                                            Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

                                            Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</a>

Enrollment in senior high school (SHS). which will comprise Grades 11 and 12, is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program. This Policy Note does note does an initial assessment of the K to 12 programs effects on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the additional demand for places in SHSs.

                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce.

(CMI Philippines, April 21, 2020) Afterwards label each paragraph according to the parts of a persuasive writing. Choose from the options given below. INTRODUCTION CALL TO ACTION 1. "Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines. EVIDENCE 2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 8. The FISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country it 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers. as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the FISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</a>

                                            The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.

"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 3. The PISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country is 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers, as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the PISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</h2><br />

                            11. Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author? Is s/he for or against the implementation of SHS? Justify your answer. 2. What is the central claim of the text? 3. Who do you think is the target reader of the text? Why? 4. What was currently happening when the text was written? What prompted the author to write the text? 5. Do you think there is sufficient and valid evidence against and for SHS? Justify your answer. 6. Based on your own experience, should SHS continue to be implemented?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The author's stand on the implementation of SHS is not clear from the given text. While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />

                            12. INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

                            14. Why Pinoy students ranked last in reading comprehension surveyMANILA - Filipino students ranked last among 79 countries in a global survey of reading comprehension because they are more used to narrative instead of informative text materials, a group said Thursday:Frederick Sotto Perez, president of the Reading Association of the Philippines, said this was the first time that the country joined the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The country joined the global survey which will provide us baseline data for our curriculum," he said. "The texts in the exam) are mainly informational and the evaluation of the text and understanding revolved on informational text and not narrative, to which our students are used to in the Philippines," Perez told ANC's Early Edition"People are alarmed by the results. This alarm may lead us to a more reflective education which we went to pursue."Perez said children should be taught expository texts that focus on factual information, at the age of 9."Reading ability is developed through practice. We can only develop fluent readers if we provide them with text, print and digital, and we practice them through teacher modeling, shared practice towards independent practice, he said.Another reason for Filipino students tenking last in the exam is poor connectivity in far-flung areas, Perez said, noting that the country "lacks reading materials." There's no internet, boolas are mainly children's books, and there are noencyclopedias and other digital texts," he said."Books and printed text are very essential. Reading culture may be promoted in schools through extended literacy projects, book talks of teachers. Schools should be active in fostering a reading culture by actually making their libraries functional."Students must also be taught to discern the credibility of a text which was one aspect that PISA tested, Perez added."I think it's important we know how to evaluate sources, that is being taught in high school, check the facts and actually cross-check," he said."Even in social media, for example, we see our students always sharing online without discerning what kind of texts they are sharing with other people."Teachers and parents must also be guided in handling digital literacy Perez said as he emphasized that all educators should be "reading teachers.""All teachers should undergo reading instruction strategy training. Our students to be able to do research should know how to read articles and facts, evaluate them, citation, distinguishing fact from opinion," he said."But if our teachers for example in science, social studies, or math are not equipped in helping our students develop those skills, the blame goes to our reading teachers."what is your personal opinion towards the subject of the new article? cite you belief or opinions why you think filipino students ranked last in the reading comprehension survey.​</h2><br />

                            15. With the enactment of the K to 12 programs, the basic education cycle is extended to include two additional years at th secondary level. Enrollment in senior high school (SHS). which will comprise Grades 11 and 12, is expected to increase to 2.0 million students in public schools and 0.7 million students in private schools in school year 2017/18. This will have an effect on the availability of classrooms for the SHS program. This Policy Note does note does an initial assessment of the K to 12 programs effects on the supply of classrooms and teachers vis-à-vis the projected demand. It points to some windows of opportunities that may be considered as possible solutions, such as allowing higher education institutions to absorb the additional demand for places in SHSs.

                            17. The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1. Vhat is the proposition of this selection? 2. What is the author's argument for his position? 3. What proof did the author present to support his argument? 4.

"Our students do not know how to process the text," opined Frederick Perez, current president of the Reading Association of the Philippines. EVIDENCE 2. The dismal performance of the Philippines in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) sends the message that the country's educational system need to take reading instruction seriously, particularly in upskilling teachers and developing effective materials for reading instructions. 8. The FISA report also revealed that expenditure per student in the country it 90 percent lower than the global average, and this limited funding results in the absence of viable teaching materials. This hampers the ability of each student to learn and comprehend the materials presented. 4. The reading problem is a national issue, so there has to be an immediate evaluation of the curriculum. Also, the government must consider allocating more funds to the education sector to make possible the training of teachers. as well as the creation and evaluation of teaching and learning materials. 5. Moreover, the Department of Education should develop materials that would introduce the learners to expository texts which deal with information. Filipino learners performed poorly in the FISA because the test is mostly made up of expository texts and calls for the processing of information, and they are not prepared for it.​</h2><br />

                            23. The implementation of the K-12 program this year has a tremendous effect on the Philippines' education system. The implementation by the Department of Education is in compliance with the Republic Act 10533 Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2012 mandating the ten-year to an additional two years, making it a twelve-year span of education for all. This paper will solely focus on its claim that an additional two years is necessary to improve the quality of education in the country. The quality of education reflects on the achievement scores of the Filipino students. To note, the Philippines ranked twenty-third (23rd out of twenty-five (25) countries that participated in the international test - the "Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study" (TIMMS). The mathematics and science test were taken by grade four students in 2003. DepEd itself pointed out that the decline in quality of education is partly attributed to the ten- year basic education cycle. The paper still stands on the claim that the additional school years are needed by our educational system. Based on the evidence presented including the low test scores in mathematics and sciences by grade four Filipino students, it shows that the additional two years will aid the student in gaining mastery of school subjects. Since our country has one of the highest number of labor workforce in the world, focusing on both on enhancing knowledge and skills are applicable to strengthen our workforce. For that reason, the paper suggests that DepEd and the govemment should focus on teacher training and development, for he law and its implementation will not fully succeed without these achers that are fully equipped and highly skilled. 1.

They offer cost-effective treatment that improves mobility and relieves pain, reduces the need for surgery and prescription drugs, and allows patients to participate in a recovery plan designed for their specific needs.  <p></p><strong>Sports coaches</strong> assist athletes in developing to their full potential. They are responsible for training athletes in a sport by analyzing their performances, instructing in relevant skills and by providing encouragement. But you are also responsible for the guidance of the athlete in life and their chosen sport. <p></p><strong>Nutritionists</strong> are experts in food and nutrition. They can promote health using nutrition information and are considered specialists who advise people on what to eat to keep a healthy lifestyle. <p></p>Health <strong>fitness specialists</strong> are often certified personal trainers, instructors and coaches who design and implement personalized exercise and fitness plans for individuals looking to improve their overall fitness levels and physical conditioning. They will perform a battery of tests to measure their clients’ aerobic capacity, strength, flexibility and mobility and subsequently offer a personalized exercise regimen that will help clients improve their physical fitness levels. <p></p><strong>Physical education teachers</strong>, commonly known as Phys Ed or P.E. teachers, are responsible for the education of primary and secondary school students in physical activity and psychomotor learning. Generally, physical education teachers instruct students in a variety of physical activities relevant to curriculum requirements. While teachers are typically allowed to create their own course syllabi, those outlines must adhere to school guidelines as well as the curriculum standards set out by governing bodies in the state, region or country. <br />

________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.
