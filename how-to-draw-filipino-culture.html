Manila, Philippines- When Supper Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban City on Nov. 8, 2013, the storm surge swept away the parents of seven-year-old boy. The tragedy did not just sweep his parents away from him, it took his voice as well.
We saw him four weeks later playing with a broken bike at the MacArthur Shrine. All that remained was the frail
body of seven-year-old boy whose faded eyes tried to hide a story so huge and too heavy to draw out. I greeted him and took his quick glance as a door that opened slightly to allow me into an incredible story of tragedy, survival, and anger.
The encounter with this young boy is by no means uncommon. Yet each story had always been unique in those
instances that we had purposely responded to human disasters and natural calamities in these past 1 years. In a calibrated response of rescue, relief and retrieval when calamities and disaster strikes, we would mobilize to
join the other teams in the field from 30 to 45 days after they hit the ground. What we had experienced in the field had taught us that the survivors are not the only ones affected by the
extraordinary experience. The tragedy of loss drains the survivors of their emotional capital. The gaping vacuum of human vitality and the unending stream of needs create a growing helplessness among the first responders. This easily replaces the energy that is sapped from them day after day. Apart from the survivors therefore, the responders are likewise affected in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.
This is the natural narrative of a people who are in the path of typhoons, whose land sits on an earthquake belt, and
whose cultural history is spiced by intrusions and invasion. Yet those who get a glimpse of this collage of colors on the
Philippine palette would gush in amazement at how resilient the Filipinos are.</a>

                                            The parol of Pampanga is a mix of Filipino and Spanish culture. The Spanish introduced us to lanterns and their construction. The Filipinos then made use of indigenous materials and creativity to give it a "folk' touch. Aside from the form and aesthetic, it is the ritual behind the parol that Filipinos can draw from. There is a team effort in its correction. The community comes together to be able to fix the lights. If not, the lights will be all tangled. A group of people helping each other in order to reach the goal is a very beautiful thing I proves that there is a sense of community in the area. I think in many places around the Philippines especially in Manila. there has been a loss of the sense of community with the rise of capitalism and profit oriented mindset, it has become every man for himsell. The sense of community needs to be restored in Filipino culture. Helping one another and the realization that we as Filipinos are all connected is important for national progress and the improvement of the quality of life. I do not mean the kind of quality of life that comes out every year that ranks the best quality of life among countries. I mean the kind of quality of life where we can trust our neighbors. Like in Bataan, there is a store with no tindera just a cash box to drop the cash in. Take what you want and drop the amount into the box. The case that comes to mind when the door is unlocked but it is ſine because the neighborhood is safe. The ſecling of being able to depend on the people around you and your community when you need help- all these come from a sense of community This is not something new to our culture. Questions: 1.

                                            Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

Usually the whole family prepares and everyone, especially with culinary expertise, brings out the best of their specialty dishes. This was so in the home of our Lola Asyon in Talisay. Lola Asyon has long gone but the tradition lives on with her grandchildren and great grandchildren. There was lechon, of course, but there was much more as prepared by the family. We were excited to taste the contribution of each. These fiestas are melancholic. The house of Lola Asyon was a highlight of my youth when we would all gather usually in the Sunday afternoons. A whole bunch of us would jump into that tiny kidney pool (how 20 of us fitted is incomprehensible now), have banca rides along the Matab-ang river, and it was pure joy playing games with fellow cousins. Fiestas are important events because they merge and nurture culture, history, family relationships and camaraderie, and also introduce us to new acquaintances. We pray that the tradition of celebrating fiestas in honor of our patron saints will not be relegated to an urban legend in the future.

Filipino resilience: Family, Faith, and Fun (An Excerpt)
By Henry Manucia
Manila, Philippines- When Supper Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban City on Nov. 8, 2013, the storm surge swept away the parents of seven-year-old boy. The tragedy did not just sweep his parents away from him, it took his voice as well.
We saw him four weeks later playing with a broken bike at the MacArthur Shrine. All that remained was the frail
body of seven-year-old boy whose faded eyes tried to hide a story so huge and too heavy to draw out. I greeted him and took his quick glance as a door that opened slightly to allow me into an incredible story of tragedy, survival, and anger.
The encounter with this young boy is by no means uncommon. Yet each story had always been unique in those
instances that we had purposely responded to human disasters and natural calamities in these past 1 years. In a calibrated response of rescue, relief and retrieval when calamities and disaster strikes, we would mobilize to
join the other teams in the field from 30 to 45 days after they hit the ground. What we had experienced in the field had taught us that the survivors are not the only ones affected by the
extraordinary experience. The tragedy of loss drains the survivors of their emotional capital. The gaping vacuum of human vitality and the unending stream of needs create a growing helplessness among the first responders. This easily replaces the energy that is sapped from them day after day. Apart from the survivors therefore, the responders are likewise affected in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.
This is the natural narrative of a people who are in the path of typhoons, whose land sits on an earthquake belt, and
whose cultural history is spiced by intrusions and invasion. Yet those who get a glimpse of this collage of colors on the
Philippine palette would gush in amazement at how resilient the Filipinos are.</h2><br />

                            12. The parol of Pampanga is a mix of Filipino and Spanish culture. The Spanish introduced us to lanterns and their construction. The Filipinos then made use of indigenous materials and creativity to give it a "folk' touch. Aside from the form and aesthetic, it is the ritual behind the parol that Filipinos can draw from. There is a team effort in its correction. The community comes together to be able to fix the lights. If not, the lights will be all tangled. A group of people helping each other in order to reach the goal is a very beautiful thing I proves that there is a sense of community in the area. I think in many places around the Philippines especially in Manila. there has been a loss of the sense of community with the rise of capitalism and profit oriented mindset, it has become every man for himsell. The sense of community needs to be restored in Filipino culture. Helping one another and the realization that we as Filipinos are all connected is important for national progress and the improvement of the quality of life. I do not mean the kind of quality of life that comes out every year that ranks the best quality of life among countries. I mean the kind of quality of life where we can trust our neighbors. Like in Bataan, there is a store with no tindera just a cash box to drop the cash in. Take what you want and drop the amount into the box. The case that comes to mind when the door is unlocked but it is ſine because the neighborhood is safe. The ſecling of being able to depend on the people around you and your community when you need help- all these come from a sense of community This is not something new to our culture. Questions: 1.

                            13. Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

Usually the whole family prepares and everyone, especially with culinary expertise, brings out the best of their specialty dishes. This was so in the home of our Lola Asyon in Talisay. Lola Asyon has long gone but the tradition lives on with her grandchildren and great grandchildren. There was lechon, of course, but there was much more as prepared by the family. We were excited to taste the contribution of each. These fiestas are melancholic. The house of Lola Asyon was a highlight of my youth when we would all gather usually in the Sunday afternoons. A whole bunch of us would jump into that tiny kidney pool (how 20 of us fitted is incomprehensible now), have banca rides along the Matab-ang river, and it was pure joy playing games with fellow cousins. Fiestas are important events because they merge and nurture culture, history, family relationships and camaraderie, and also introduce us to new acquaintances. We pray that the tradition of celebrating fiestas in honor of our patron saints will not be relegated to an urban legend in the future.
