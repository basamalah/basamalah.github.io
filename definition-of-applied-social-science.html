The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3.

ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on.

The search for practical applicationscientific knowledge to develop more Often referred to as "technology Technology comes from the Greek wark "technologia, which is a combination of techne meaning craft, andApplied science is a discipline that is used to apply existing practical applications, for example: technology or inventions.logia means study.The first technological tools were simple hand-axes made by our ancestors millions of years ago. Technology is a product of engineering and science. Science aims to understand why and how nature andengineering seeks to shape the natura world to meet human need as and wents.Examples of Applied ScienceScientist invent motion pictures, eyeglasses and contact lenses.Pharmacologist make and manufacture drugs and medicines. Engineers created bridges and tall buildings.1.3 Field study of ScienceScience has three major branches1. Social Sciences-It focuses primarily on the study of people and culture2. Formal Sciences-It is concerned with properties of formal systems based on definition3. Natural Sciences-It tries to understand the real world.Division of Natural ScienceBiological Science- any of the branches of natural science dealing with living things, such as their structure, behavior, organization, life processes, as well as their interactions with each other and with the natural environment Supplement. It includes biology and other related disciplines. Physical Science - the sciences concerned with the study of inanimate natural objects, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and related subjects. The study of non-living things.________________________1.DIRECTIONS: Read and answer the questions carefully.WORKSHEET NO.11 It is the search for facts.2. tuses the discoveries of pure science to create practical solutions to existing problems. 3. It is the Greek word for technology.4. It came from the Latin word means "Scientia",5. Technology comes from the Greek word technologia, techne means logia mean.II. ESSAYScience and technology feed off of one another, propelling both forward. Scientific knowledge allows us tobuild new technologies, which often allows us to make new observations about the world, which in turn, alow us to build even more scientific knowledge, which then inspire technology and so on.
