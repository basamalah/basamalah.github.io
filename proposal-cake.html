Below are scenarios which call for a specific organizational design. If you were the
manager, what is the most appropriate organizational design that you will choose?
Scenario
Best Organizational
Design that you will
choose and why?
1. There are lots of milktea shops which sprout within
your locality. Because of this, you want to have
another line of business which will complement your
milktea business. You come up with an idea of
opening a cake and dessert shop. You hire a cake
and pastry chef and two store attendants. This is in
addition to your existing two milktea shop employees.
Moreover, you will put up two additional stores in the
nearby municipalities. You hire a manager and a
supply officer for each branch and the same number
of employees in the first store. Because of the
growing number of employees, you also hire an
administrative staff to take care of the employment
concerns.
2. You are an overseas Filipino worker who decides to
quit working abroad and put up an agricultural
supply business. You plan to hire one sales clerk,
two warehouse men and one office clerk. You will
oversee the day-to-day operations of the store.
3. Your company knows that your hand sanitizer
sales
seem to have been overtaken by other competitor
brands in the market. The board of directors has
approved your proposal to form a core group who will
conduct a research that will find out the current
demand and trends in hand sanitizers and come up
with a new product. You have instructed the ten area
managers from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao to
send the names of their marketing head and company
researchers. The twenty men and women will be the
members of the national product development group
who will be led by a marketing research head.
Although they are assigned to be a member of this
endeavor, they will still report their participation and
accomplishments to their mother branch manager.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A Proton<strong> </strong>is a positively charge particle located in the nucleus of an atom.</p><p>2.<strong> </strong>Electron.Anegatively charged particle found circling or orbiting an atomic nucleus. An electron, like a proton is a charged particle, although opposite in sign, but unlike a proton, an electron has negligible atomic mass. Electrons contribute no atomic mass units to the total atomic weight of an atom.</p><p>3. Neutron,neutral subatomic particle that is a constituent of every atomic nucleus except ordinary hydrogen</p><p>4. Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons but the same number of protons and electrons.</p><p>5. Scientists once thought the most fundamental building block of matter was a particle called the atom. Now we know that the atom is made of many smaller pieces, known as subatomic particles. </p><p>Every atom contains a central core called the nucleus, made of particles called protons and neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by mostly empty space, except for very tiny particles called electrons that orbit the nucleus. Recently, scientists have discovered that protons and neutrons are made of smaller particles known as quarks.</p><p>6. Chadwick James,By 1920, physicists knew that most of the mass of the atom was located in a nucleus at its center, and that this central core contained protons. In May 1932 James Chadwick announced that the core also contained a new uncharged particle, which he called the neutron.</p><p>7. In 1909, Ernest Rutherford’s student reported some unexpected results from an experiment Rutherford had assigned him. Rutherford called this news the most incredible event of his life.In the now well-known experiment, alpha particles were observed to scatter backwards from a gold foil. Rutherford’s explanation, which he published in May 1911, was that the scattering was caused by a hard, dense core at the center of the atom–the nucleus.</p><p>8. Thrompsons proposed a model, sometimes called a "plum pudding" or raisins cake model.</p><p>9. An elements mass A number is the sum of the numbers of protons and the numbers of neutrons.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sa comment na yung no.10</p><p></p><br />

Rutherford discovered them in experiments with cathode-ray tubes that were conducted between 1911 and 1919. Protons are about 99.86% as massive as neutrons according to the Jefferson Lab. The number of protons in an atom is unique to each element.</p><p>2.<strong>E</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong> </strong>have a negative electrical charge.
