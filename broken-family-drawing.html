Filipino resilience: Family, Faith, and Fun (An Excerpt)
By Henry Manucia
Manila, Philippines- When Supper Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban City on Nov. 8, 2013, the storm surge swept away the parents of seven-year-old boy. The tragedy did not just sweep his parents away from him, it took his voice as well.
We saw him four weeks later playing with a broken bike at the MacArthur Shrine. All that remained was the frail
body of seven-year-old boy whose faded eyes tried to hide a story so huge and too heavy to draw out. I greeted him and took his quick glance as a door that opened slightly to allow me into an incredible story of tragedy, survival, and anger.
The encounter with this young boy is by no means uncommon. Yet each story had always been unique in those
instances that we had purposely responded to human disasters and natural calamities in these past 1 years. In a calibrated response of rescue, relief and retrieval when calamities and disaster strikes, we would mobilize to
join the other teams in the field from 30 to 45 days after they hit the ground. What we had experienced in the field had taught us that the survivors are not the only ones affected by the
extraordinary experience. The tragedy of loss drains the survivors of their emotional capital. The gaping vacuum of human vitality and the unending stream of needs create a growing helplessness among the first responders. This easily replaces the energy that is sapped from them day after day. Apart from the survivors therefore, the responders are likewise affected in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.
This is the natural narrative of a people who are in the path of typhoons, whose land sits on an earthquake belt, and
whose cultural history is spiced by intrusions and invasion. Yet those who get a glimpse of this collage of colors on the
Philippine palette would gush in amazement at how resilient the Filipinos are.</a>

Underline all the textual evidence that supports it.2. “COVID-19 has chillingly robbed the rights of a person in death. Our hearts turn heavy at every piece of news of a passing friend, relative, or stranger, whom hospital authorities decide must be buried with the special protocol. In several places in the country, ugly squabbles have broken out, where families have clashed with police and hospital staff over bodies of their loved ones, shouting their refusal of the COVID-19 burial protocol. They snatched the bodies from the morgues and ambulances, even though the hospitals provide the basic religious rites with hospital staff and a few family members. The families instead insisted on proper rites and funerals, ignoring the risk of contamination when the body is washed or dressed.” – Ati Nurbaiti​</a>

Filipino resilience: Family, Faith, and Fun (An Excerpt)
By Henry Manucia
Manila, Philippines- When Supper Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban City on Nov. 8, 2013, the storm surge swept away the parents of seven-year-old boy. The tragedy did not just sweep his parents away from him, it took his voice as well.
We saw him four weeks later playing with a broken bike at the MacArthur Shrine. All that remained was the frail
body of seven-year-old boy whose faded eyes tried to hide a story so huge and too heavy to draw out. I greeted him and took his quick glance as a door that opened slightly to allow me into an incredible story of tragedy, survival, and anger.
The encounter with this young boy is by no means uncommon. Yet each story had always been unique in those
instances that we had purposely responded to human disasters and natural calamities in these past 1 years. In a calibrated response of rescue, relief and retrieval when calamities and disaster strikes, we would mobilize to
join the other teams in the field from 30 to 45 days after they hit the ground. What we had experienced in the field had taught us that the survivors are not the only ones affected by the
extraordinary experience. The tragedy of loss drains the survivors of their emotional capital. The gaping vacuum of human vitality and the unending stream of needs create a growing helplessness among the first responders. This easily replaces the energy that is sapped from them day after day. Apart from the survivors therefore, the responders are likewise affected in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.
This is the natural narrative of a people who are in the path of typhoons, whose land sits on an earthquake belt, and
whose cultural history is spiced by intrusions and invasion. Yet those who get a glimpse of this collage of colors on the
Philippine palette would gush in amazement at how resilient the Filipinos are.</h2><br />
