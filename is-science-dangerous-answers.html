Anhidrosis is the inability to sweat normally. When you don't sweat (perspire), your body can't cool itself, which can lead to overheating and sometimes to heatstroke — a potentially fatal condition</p><p></p><p>3. The liver cells convert ammonia to a much less toxic substance called urea, which is released into the blood.

When nitrogen waste products, such as creatinine and urea, build up in the body, the condition is called azotemia. These waste products act as poisons when they build up.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Science is normally carried out in safe conditions by trained people, so considerably safer than many other occupations, such as forestry working or farming. In my over 22 years in labs, there were no real disasters. getting splashed with acid meant diving under a strong shower- happened once, no permanent damage. Nasty fumes are born away by fans, dangerous chemicals used in fume cupboards, sometimes through gloves, and in our case we had an active safety committee which would bollock people if they were seen doing anything . </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>you know i dont know ok me too</p><br />

                            23. Answer the questions in not more than five sentence each. According to Science, shape and volcanic eruption may have a direct relationship and it is said that stratovolcanoes are the most dangerous volcanoes. What if all volcanoes had the same shape or structure? What do you think would happen? Consider this situation. You live in a place near a stratovolcano with your knowledge about the types of volcanoes according to their structure, how will you spread awareness in your community to help them prepare for what might come?Pasagot po ASAP Pls po need help </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Most land volcanoes have the same basic structure, but volcano shape and size varies considerably. There are several elements that these different volcano types have in common are: a summit crater - the mouth of the volcano, where the lava exists. a magma chamber - where the lava wells up underground</p><p></p><p>If all the depositors went to ask for their money at the same time, then there will be a huge cash crisis in the banks as they will run out of the money. </p><p>They will not be able to give loan to investors and companies.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dry season</p><p>The dry season is a yearly period of low rainfall, especially in the tropics. The weather in the tropics is dominated by the tropical rain belt, which moves from the northern to the southern tropics and back over the course of the year.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Wet season</p><p>The wet season is the time of year when most of a region's average annual rainfall occurs. Generally, the season lasts at least a month. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics.</p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><p>STAY SAFE</p><p>#CARRYONLEARNING</p><br />
