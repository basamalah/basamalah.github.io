                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Transitional devices are like bridges between parts of your paper. They are cues that help the reader to interpret ideas a paper develops. Transitional devices are words or phrases that help carry a thought from one sentence to another, from one idea to another, or from one paragraph to another. And finally, transitional devices link sentences and paragraphs together smoothly so that there are no abrupt jumps or breaks between ideas.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several types of transitional devices, and each category leads readers to make certain connections or assumptions. Some lead readers forward and imply the building of an idea or thought, while others make readers compare ideas or draw conclusions from the preceding thoughts.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>paki brain list</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here’s what I noticed when looking at my own relationships. Those that were heavily based in contact through social media outlets were much less substantial than those relationships where we kept in touch in person, over the phone, or via email on a regular basis. How those deeper relationships are maintained varied mostly based on physical distance.</p><p></p><p>For example, I have plenty of colleagues I consider friends. Many of them I keep in touch with solely through Twitter, social networks like LinkedIn, and blog comments. Those relationships tend to be much more casual, and we tend to know much less about each other. Once we hit the phase of emailing each other though, things change. Those relationships were much deeper than the social media based ones. We could have more private conversations. We could have longer conversations. And I found that people tended to open up much more about things unrelated to work via email than they did in social media.</p><br />

Do this on a separate sheet of paper. &amp; (Write your own title) Introduction: (In the introduction part you should capture the reader's attention, define the issue given and state your claim.)

                        <p><strong>Title</strong>: The Complexity of Social Media</p><p></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: In recent years, social media has become a ubiquitous presence in the lives of people around the world. While it has brought many benefits, it has also created new problems and challenges. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of social media and ultimately argue that it is a complex phenomenon that cannot be simply classified as a "boon" or a "bane."</p><p></p><p><strong>Body</strong>:</p><p>One argument in favor of social media is that it has greatly expanded the ability of individuals and organizations to connect and communicate with one another. This has opened up new opportunities for the exchange of ideas, the formation of communities, and the sharing of information on a global scale. For example, social media platforms have been instrumental in enabling social movements to mobilize and gain visibility, such as the Arab Spring and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p></p><p>However, social media has also been criticized for its negative impacts on mental health and well-being. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, as well as sleep disturbances and decreased face-to-face communication skills. In addition, the spread of misinformation and propaganda on social media has the potential to cause harm to individuals and society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Another concern is the issue of data privacy and security on social media. Many people are unaware of the extent to which their personal information is being collected and shared by these companies, and there have been numerous instances of data breaches and misuse of user data.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it is clear that social media is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has both positive and negative aspects. While it has brought many benefits, it is important to recognize and address the risks and challenges that it has created.</p><br />

</p><p>2. Parents feel happy when they bond with their children. </p><p><strong>Answer: Happy emoji</strong>
</p><p>3. Reading books is better than playing mobile games.
</p><p><strong>Answer: Happy emoji</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Adjectives </strong>are words that describe the qualities or states of being of nouns: enormous, doglike, silly, yellow, fun, fast. They can also describe the quantity of nouns: many, few, millions, eleven.</p><p></p>DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADJECTIVESDescriptive Adjectives<p>A descriptive adjective is a word which describes nouns and pronouns. Most of the adjectives belong in this type. These adjectives provide information and attribute to the nouns/pronouns they modify or describe. Descriptive adjectives are also called qualitative adjectives.</p><p>Examples:
</p>I have a <strong>fast </strong>car.  I am <strong>hungry</strong>.  I saw a <strong>flying </strong>Eagle.<p>
</p>
Quantitative Adjectives<p>A quantitative adjective provides information about the quantity of the nouns/pronouns. This type belongs to the question category of ‘how much’ and ‘how many’.
</p><p>
Examples:
</p>
I have <strong>20 </strong>bucks in my wallet. (How much)
They have <strong>three </strong>children. (How many)
You should have completed the <strong>whole </strong>task.
<p></p>Proper Adjectives<p>Proper adjectives are the adjective form of proper nouns. When proper nouns modify or describe other nouns/pronouns, they become proper adjectives. ‘Proper’ means ‘specific’ rather than ‘formal’ or ‘polite.’</p><p>Example:
</p><p>
<strong>American </strong>cars are very strong.
</p><p><strong>Chinese </strong>people are hard workers.
</p><p>I love <strong>KFC </strong>burgers.</p><p>
</p>Demonstrative Adjectives<p>A demonstrative adjective directly refers to something or someone. It works alone and does not precede a noun, but a demonstrative adjective always comes before the word it modifies.</p><p>Examples:
</p><p>
<strong>That </strong>house is so gorgeously decorated.  </p><p><strong>This</strong> bike<strong> </strong>car is mine.</p><p><strong>These</strong> bracelets are cute. </p><p>
</p>Possessive Adjectives<p>A possessive adjective indicates possession or ownership. It suggests the belongingness of something to someone/something.</p><p>Examples:
</p><p>
<strong>My </strong>car is parked outside.
</p><p><strong>His </strong>cat is very cute.
</p><p><strong>Our </strong>job is almost done.</p><p>
</p>Interrogative Adjectives<p>An interrogative adjective asks a question. An interrogative adjective must be followed by a noun or a pronoun. </p><p>Examples:
</p><p>
<strong>Which </strong>phone do you use?
</p><p><strong>What </strong>game do you want to play?
</p><p><strong>Whose </strong>car is this?
</p><p>
</p>Indefinite Adjectives<p>An indefinite adjective describes or modifies a noun unspecifically. They provide indefinite/unspecific information about the noun.</p><p>Examples:
</p><p>
I gave <strong>some </strong>candy to her.
</p><p>I want a <strong>few </strong>moments alone.
</p><p><strong>Several </strong>writers wrote about the recent incidents.</p><p></p><p>Adjective is a part of sentence.
