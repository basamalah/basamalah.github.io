                                            Plants, like animals live on land and in water. Plants that live on land are called terrestrialplants while those that live in water are called aquatic plants. They exist in different kinds and sizes.Plants are food makers and are fed by some animals. In this lesson, you will learn how to identify thespecialized structures of terrestrial and aquatic plants. Do you have a garden at home? Do you know atleast 10 plants in your area? Now, write at least 3 plants and complete the chart below.Name of PlantsDescribe and draw.StemRootsLeavesFlower1.2.3.Example: Rosehard w/ thorndeep rootedmany leavesred color w/ scent​</a>

A geometric series is a series whose related sequenceis geometric. It results from adding the terms of a geometricsequence. Take for example the problem below.Problem:An online seller doubles his profit every day. If he gained P 20.00 onthe first day, what would his total income be after 2 weeks (14 days)?This problem can be solved using geometric series. Moreover, it is afinite sequence because there are only 14 terms in the sequence​</a>

Graphs are diagrams showing the relationbetween variable quantities, typically of twovariables, each measured along a pair of axesat right angles2. Bar graphs show letters that are independentof each other.3. A pictograph/pictogram is a special type of bargraph. Instead of using an axis with numbers,it uses pictures to represent a particularnumber of items.4. A pie graph (pie chart) shows you how awhole is divided into different parts.5. A table, also known as matrix, refers anorderly arranged quantitative data usingpictures to represent number of items6. A flowchart shows the sequenceofmovements or actions of people or thingsinvolved in a complex system or activity.7. Anime Poster is an example of text visualelement.8. Visual element's primary function is toimprove comprehension of a reading material9. The concept of visual-verbal symbiosis isrooted in the idea that "visuals" support"verbals," and vice versa.10.

                            21. (True or False) 1. Vascular plants have true transporting tissues called the xylem and phloem. 2. Mosses, liverworts and hornworts are vascular plants. 3. Gumamela, mango tree and coconut tree are example of vascular plants. 4. Ferns are non-vascular plants because they do not bear flowers. 5. Plants are classified into two big groups according to their special tissues used for transporting food nutrients and water to all parts. 6. Mosses, liverworts and hornworts are anchored to the ground through true roots. 7. Rhizoids are the root-like structures used by nonvascular plants to anchor themselves to the ground. 8. Pine trees are example of conifers. 9. Green algae is the closest ancestor of non-vascular plants.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>True</strong></p><p>Vascular plants (tracheophytes) differ from the nonvascular bryophytes in that they possess specialized supporting and <strong>water-conducting tissue, called xylem, and food-conducting tissue, called phloem.</strong></p><p></p><p>2. <strong>False</strong></p><p>Bryophytes (liverworts, mosses, and hornworts) are <strong>non-vascular plants </strong>that appeared on earth over 450 million years ago. The most important feature of mosses and liverworts is that they have no vascular system. A vascular system in plants is a series of tubes that can transport water and nutrients over a distance. That vascular system of xylem and phloem allows redwood and sequoia trees to grow to over one hundred feet tall.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>True</strong></p><p>Vascular plants are also referred to as tracheophytes. Vascular plants also produce seeds and flowers, although some of them do produce spores as well.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>False</strong></p><p>A fern is a member of a group of <strong>vascular plants</strong> that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having specialized tissues that conduct water and nutrients and in having life cycles in which the sporophyte is the dominant phase.</p><p></p><p>5. <strong>True</strong></p><p>It is made of two specialized conducting tissues xylem and phloem. Xylem tissue transports water and nutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant. Unlike xylem-conducting cells, phloem-conducting cells are alive at maturity. The xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other.</p><p></p><p>6. <strong>False</strong></p><p>non-vascular land plants commonly referred to as <strong>hepatics or liverworts</strong>. Like mosses and hornworts, they have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information.</p><p></p><p>7. <strong>True</strong></p><p>Most bryophytes are small. They not only lack vascular tissues. They also lack true leaves, seeds, and flowers. Instead of roots, <strong>they have hair-like rhizoids to anchor them to the ground and to absorb water and minerals</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p>8. <strong>True</strong></p><p>Conifers are, most simply, plants that have cones. So yes, <strong>pine trees are conifers</strong></p><p></p><p>9. <strong>True</strong></p><p>green algae are the closest living relatives to modern land plants. The major plant lineages and features that are characteristic of each group. The evolutionary relationships among the <strong>nonvascular plants, seedless vascular plants, nonflowering seed plants, and flowering seed plants.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>CARRYONLEARNING</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

They exist in different kinds and sizes.Plants are food makers and are fed by some animals. In this lesson, you will learn how to identify thespecialized structures of terrestrial and aquatic plants.

A geometric series is a series whose related sequenceis geometric. It results from adding the terms of a geometricsequence. Take for example the problem below.Problem:An online seller doubles his profit every day. If he gained P 20.00 onthe first day, what would his total income be after 2 weeks (14 days)?This problem can be solved using geometric series.
