                                            SELF DISCIPLINE IN THE AMIDST OF PANDEMIC
The corona virus or known for the name Covid-1, According to health experts believe that
the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to
humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person
contact. (Goodwin, 2020). Later on this corona virus has spread drastically in many parts of the
world. And to be exact, March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the Covid-19 as pandemic.
At this time of pandemic there are a lot of problems an individual may experience. It can
be either internal or external problem. But let us consider managing ourselves by mean of
achieving self-discipline. This may be difficult but in order to have a healthy and professional life.
One must take a look at this. He/She might experience problem on dealing with everyday living.
Because of the problem caused by the pandemic. One of the best ways to achieve sel-disciplined
person makes optimum use of time, provide a timetable for everything and will fall into it's proper
places.
The reason why a lot of people feel they lack self-discipline it is because they lack clear
goals to achieve. Then often lack of clear plan, self-confidence, and a lot more. What is the
cause of this? Once you set a goal for example and then you miss it. That's the time where the
effect of that day will ruin everything you have planned. But that's okay, you can start over and
over again. Then later on the good thing is, when you think about the things you already manage
to do, the goals you already have, you might have realized that you are achieving something at
the end of the day.
How to maintain inner peace in the midst of this pandemic? First is to have a self-
discipline that means self-control, it gives you the ability to control yourself from everything
especially right now. It helps you deal with your actions and reaction in different aspects of life.
Second is to do meditation, the best way to connect our energy in the right way. It helps you
maintain your focus and think of the most important things. Lastly, stay away from distractions
or negative vibes. Although this may happen at times, but make sure to have a balance on how
to deal with it.
The life we had before the pandemic is really different from the life we have today. There
are things we usually do before the pandemic happens. Before, people can easily earn money
because they have the assurance of being paid by their institution. But now, Everyday people
are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return. No matter what
happen we have to remember that everything happens for a reason. Through self-discipline, It
is one of the most important and useful skills to achieve success and everyone should possess
this quality especially during this time.

                            17. SELF DISCIPLINE IN THE AMIDST OF PANDEMIC
The corona virus or known for the name Covid-1, According to health experts believe that
the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to
humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person
contact. (Goodwin, 2020). Later on this corona virus has spread drastically in many parts of the
world. And to be exact, March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the Covid-19 as pandemic.
At this time of pandemic there are a lot of problems an individual may experience. It can
be either internal or external problem. But let us consider managing ourselves by mean of
achieving self-discipline. This may be difficult but in order to have a healthy and professional life.
One must take a look at this. He/She might experience problem on dealing with everyday living.
Because of the problem caused by the pandemic. One of the best ways to achieve sel-disciplined
person makes optimum use of time, provide a timetable for everything and will fall into it's proper
places.
The reason why a lot of people feel they lack self-discipline it is because they lack clear
goals to achieve. Then often lack of clear plan, self-confidence, and a lot more. What is the
cause of this? Once you set a goal for example and then you miss it. That's the time where the
effect of that day will ruin everything you have planned. But that's okay, you can start over and
over again. Then later on the good thing is, when you think about the things you already manage
to do, the goals you already have, you might have realized that you are achieving something at
the end of the day.
How to maintain inner peace in the midst of this pandemic? First is to have a self-
discipline that means self-control, it gives you the ability to control yourself from everything
especially right now. It helps you deal with your actions and reaction in different aspects of life.
Second is to do meditation, the best way to connect our energy in the right way. It helps you
maintain your focus and think of the most important things. Lastly, stay away from distractions
or negative vibes. Although this may happen at times, but make sure to have a balance on how
to deal with it.
The life we had before the pandemic is really different from the life we have today. There
are things we usually do before the pandemic happens. Before, people can easily earn money
because they have the assurance of being paid by their institution. But now, Everyday people
are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return. No matter what
happen we have to remember that everything happens for a reason. Through self-discipline, It
is one of the most important and useful skills to achieve success and everyone should possess
this quality especially during this time.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>pa</strong><strong> </strong><strong>brainliest</strong><strong> answer</strong><strong> po</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p></p><p>Community immersion is an essential aspect of the National Service Training Program (NSTP) 2, which aims to expose student-trainees to the realities and needs of the marginalized sectors of the society. As a student-trainee, I believe that a self-reliant and self-managed community is the primary goal of every community organization. A sustainable community is one that can meet the needs of its residents without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This involves creating a community that is economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable.</p><p></p><p>In order to achieve this goal, community organizations must work hand in hand with the residents of the community. Empowering the community through education, training, and the provision of resources is crucial in building a self-reliant and self-managed community. It is also important to ensure that the community's culture and traditions are respected and preserved, as these are essential components of their identity.</p><p></p><p>As a student-trainee, I can involve myself in the community by participating in community projects and initiatives that aim to address the needs and concerns of the residents. I can also volunteer my time and skills to organizations that work for the betterment of the community. Additionally, I can actively participate in community meetings and forums to express my views and ideas on how to improve the community.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the government and private sectors' involvement in trends such as modernization of jeepneys, hazing, teenage pregnancy, and many more, I believe that their role is crucial in addressing these issues. The government must provide support and resources to organizations and initiatives that aim to address these issues. The private sector must also take responsibility and actively participate in initiatives that promote the well-being of the community. Overall, community immersion is a vital aspect of NSTP 2, and I believe that student-trainees have an important role to play in building self-reliant and sustainable communities.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>based on what I have learned, I can provide some insights on the topic of community immersion in the course NSTP 2.</p><p></p><p>Community immersion is an important component of the NSTP program as it aims to instill social responsibility and civic consciousness among college students. Through community immersion, students can learn about the realities of the community they are serving, gain first-hand experience on the different issues and problems that affect the community, and contribute to the development of sustainable solutions to address these issues.</p><p></p><p>The primary goal of every community organization is to develop a self-reliant and self-managed community that is sustainable in the long run. This means that community organizations should not only focus on providing immediate relief to the community's needs but also develop programs and initiatives that will empower the community members to become self-sufficient and resilient in the future.</p><p></p><p>As an NSTP 2 student-trainee, there are several ways on how you can involve and engage yourself in the community where you belong. Here are some ideas:</p><p></p><p>Participate in community outreach programs and volunteer work such as medical missions, feeding programs, and environmental clean-up drives.</p><p>Conduct community needs assessments to identify the issues and concerns that affect the community and develop sustainable solutions to address them.</p><p>Organize and facilitate community forums and workshops that aim to promote awareness and education on various issues such as health, environment, and human rights.</p><p>Regarding the government or private sectors that involve in trends such as modernization of jeepneys, hazing, teenage pregnancy, and many more, it is essential to take a critical and objective view of their actions. While some initiatives may be beneficial to the community, others may have unintended consequences and negative impacts. It is important to evaluate their programs and initiatives based on their effectiveness, efficiency, and impact on the community. It is also important to promote transparency and accountability to ensure that these organizations are working for the benefit of the community and not for their own interests.</p><p></p><p>Overall, community immersion in the course NSTP 2 is an essential component of promoting social responsibility and civic consciousness among college students. By involving themselves in the community and developing sustainable solutions to address the community's needs, students can contribute to the development of a self-reliant and self-managed community that is sustainable in the long run.</p><br />
