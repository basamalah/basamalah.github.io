They work best when integrating two or more independent, connected sentences into one.</p><p></p><p>Because they frequently contain coordinating conjunction, also known as a <strong>FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, and So)</strong> word, compound sentences are simple to spot. A conjunction is not required when using a semicolon to join two clauses in complex sentences, though.</p><p></p><p>There are two punctuation <strong>rules</strong> to remember while writing compound sentences:</p>Separate each coordinating conjunction with a comma.Put a semicolon between each phrase if you're not utilizing coordinating conjunction in your sentence.<p></p><p><strong>Learn more about compound verbs here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/549862#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Attitude:</p><p>Chun Yang: She is a kind and selfless woman who always puts others before herself. She has a positive attitude towards life and is determined to help those in need, even if it means risking her own safety. She also believes in the power of love and the importance of forming strong relationships with others.</p><p></p><p>Jae Hyo Shin: He is a proud and selfish man who only cares about himself and his desires. He has a negative attitude towards life and is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals, even if it means hurting others. He also does not value relationships and sees people as tools to be used for his own benefit.</p><p></p><p>Culture:</p><p>The tale of Chun Yang is set in ancient Korea and portrays the cultural values of the time. One of the key cultural beliefs is the importance of filial piety and respect for elders. Chun Yang is praised for her devotion to her parents and for respecting the wishes of her father. Another cultural belief highlighted in the tale is the importance of relationships and community. Chun Yang forms strong bonds with those around her, while Jae Hyo Shin is seen as an outsider due to his selfish behavior.</p><p></p><p>Belief:</p><p>The tale also highlights the belief that good deeds are rewarded while bad deeds are punished. Chun Yang is rewarded for her selflessness, kindness, and willingness to help others. Jae Hyo Shin, on the other hand, suffers the consequences of his selfish actions, ultimately leading to his downfall. The tale also promotes the idea that true love conquers all, as Chun Yang and her lover are able to overcome the obstacles and challenges they face through their love for each other.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>anyongaseyo</p><p>bues dias</p><p>tsungkwa </p><p></p><br />
