                            1. Write an "informative speech" about Mobile Games . The speech should also include not less than 5 cohesive devices.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good evening everyone,</p><p></p><p>Today I'd like to talk to you about mobile games - a topic that I'm sure is near and dear to many of our hearts. Mobile games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment over the years, with millions of people around the world spending hours each day playing their favorite games on their phones or tablets.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, let me begin by defining what we mean by mobile games. Mobile games are games that are played on smartphones, tablets, or other handheld devices. They come in a variety of genres, from casual games like Candy Crush to more complex games like role-playing games and first-person shooters.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's talk about why mobile games are so popular. One of the main reasons is their accessibility. With most people carrying their smartphones with them at all times, mobile games are always within reach. In addition, many mobile games are free to download and play, making them an easy and affordable way to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>Another reason for their popularity is the social aspect. Many mobile games allow players to connect with friends and other players online, making the gaming experience more interactive and engaging. This also creates a sense of community among players, which can be particularly important during times of isolation and social distancing.</p><p></p><p>Despite their popularity, some people may view mobile games as a waste of time or a distraction from more important things. However, research has shown that playing mobile games can have several benefits, including improving cognitive function, reducing stress and anxiety, and increasing social interaction.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's move on to cohesive devices. Cohesive devices are words or phrases that help to connect ideas and make a text or speech more coherent. Here are some examples of cohesive devices I will be using in this speech:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, as I mentioned earlier, cohesive devices can be used to indicate the order of ideas. In this speech, I've used "firstly" to introduce my first point about defining mobile games.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, cohesive devices can be used to add information to a previous point. For example, I used "in addition" to add more information to my point about the accessibility of mobile games.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, cohesive devices can be used to show contrast between ideas. For instance, I used "despite their popularity" to introduce a contrasting point about the negative perceptions some people have of mobile games.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, cohesive devices can be used to summarize or conclude an argument. Towards the end of my speech, I'll use phrases like "in conclusion" and "to sum up" to wrap up my main points.</p><p></p><p>Finally, cohesive devices can be used to give examples to support a point. For example, I used "from casual games like Candy Crush to more complex games like role-playing games and first-person shooters" to give examples of different types of mobile games.</p><p></p><p>To sum up, mobile games are a popular form of entertainment that provide accessibility, social interaction, and cognitive benefits. They are not just a waste of time, but can have several positive effects on our well-being. So next time someone tells you to put down your phone and stop playing games, you can tell them that you're actually improving your cognitive function and reducing stress!</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            2. Write an informative, entertaining, or persuasive speech (choose only one) about Mobile Games . The speech should also include not less than 5 cohesive devices.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Persuasive Speech on the Benefits of Mobile Games</p><p></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>Today, I would like to talk to you about mobile games and why they are more than just a source of entertainment. Mobile games have become a global phenomenon and are enjoyed by people of all ages. However, many still view them as a waste of time or even harmful to our well-being. I am here to persuade you otherwise.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, let's consider the cognitive benefits of mobile games. Studies have shown that playing games can improve cognitive function, such as attention, memory, and problem-solving skills. Games like Candy Crush, Sudoku, and Brain Training apps can stimulate the brain and enhance mental agility.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, mobile games can be a great stress-reliever. Whether it's a quick round of Angry Birds or a longer gaming session, playing games can be a fun way to unwind and forget about our daily stresses. It can also provide a sense of achievement and boost self-esteem.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, mobile games can be an excellent social activity. Many games allow players to connect with others and play together, creating a sense of community and shared experience. Online multiplayer games like Fortnite and Among Us have become popular worldwide and provide a fun way to connect with friends and family.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, mobile games can also be educational. Many games are designed to teach new skills or reinforce existing ones. For example, language learning games like Duolingo can help users improve their language skills while having fun.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, mobile games can be a source of inspiration and creativity. Many games allow players to create their content, such as levels, characters, and stories. This encourages creativity and can even lead to the development of new skills like coding and game design.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, mobile games are more than just a source of entertainment. They offer a range of benefits, from improving cognitive function to providing stress relief, social interaction, education, and creativity. So, the next time someone tells you that mobile games are a waste of time, remind them of the many benefits that come with playing them.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's talk about the cohesive devices I have used in this speech. Firstly, I used repetition by emphasizing the phrase "more than just" to emphasize the many benefits of mobile games. Secondly, I used transitional phrases such as "Firstly," "Secondly," and "Lastly" to structure my argument and guide the audience. Thirdly, I used rhetorical questions to engage the audience and encourage them to think about the topic. Fourthly, I used examples to illustrate my points and make my argument more compelling. Finally, I used contrast to highlight the difference between the negative perception of mobile games and their many benefits</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Have you ever not believed your parent when they told you something? Or argued back? Most of us do. Most of us also like video games. And most parents say they're bad for you. But really video games can be just as good as bad if not better. Today's generation prefers to play video games or computer games, as a form of entertainment, which can improve the minds of those who play them. Amid all the cool and colorful graphics, the fantastic music. and the intriguing and exciting plots, which can attract for those played them.</p><p>There are many benefits in playing video games but I would like to stress out the two most beneficial in playing video games which is reduce the stress and video games work as mind exercise. Does anyone know that games can reduces stress? As humans, we crave the need to play because it is instinctive and fundamental to human existence. With regular play, our problem-solving and adaptive abilities will be in much better shape to handle this complex world.</p><p>The reason for this is that play teaches us how to manage or "transform" our negative emotions, and it is the foundation for sound mental, physical, and emotional health. Play can make work seem like pleasure, and aside from this, it is just plain fun. It creates laughter and freedom that can instantly reduce stress and add a feeling of relaxation to our daily living. For example playing 'The Sims' will make your relax and enjoy as being the character in the game.</p><p>You will have your own house, family and you have your own carrier. Besides reducing stress in playing games it also, work as mind exercise. Playing video games is the best mind exercise as it not only makes the mind sharp but also keeps it fit. By various studies, it is discovered that video games help in improving problem solving ability as we can solve the problem without anyone's help. Else than that video games that tend to demand the player to make quick and accurate decision-making is its impromptu situations.</p><p>The mental fitness can only be achieved through engaging in activities that are aimed at increasing your mental activity, and they involve activities such as reading, solving of riddles and crossword puzzles. Numbers games like Sudoku, as well as word games, can be addicting but, unlike most addictions, they are actually good for your brain. Playing them helps to stimulate your mind; it improves your memory and may aid in delaying the effects of aging.</p><p>The video game world is changing constantly so it is very necessary that players should</p><p>have the knowledge about the games that will be beneficial for them. Believe me it is pay</p><p>off when you spend your time by playing a video games. Do not just only think the negative</p><p>effect of games but also try thinking the positive side. Video games not only reduce you</p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p><strong>Persuasive Speech:</strong> Why Mobile Games are the Future of Gaming</p><p></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, today I am here to talk to you about something that has been a major part of our lives for the past decade - mobile games. Mobile games have been an integral part of the gaming industry, and have been continuously evolving and improving with each passing day. Today, I want to convince you that mobile games are the future of gaming.</p><p></p><p><strong>Firstly</strong>, mobile games are more accessible than traditional console or PC games. Mobile phones are ubiquitous, and almost everyone has access to one. This makes mobile gaming more accessible to a larger audience than console or PC gaming. Additionally, mobile games can be played on the go, making them a great way to pass the time during commutes or breaks. This accessibility makes mobile games the perfect platform for casual gamers who want to unwind after a long day, or for people who are just starting out in the gaming world.</p><p></p><p><strong>Secondly</strong>, mobile games are cheaper than traditional console or PC games. The price of a mobile game is usually a fraction of what you would pay for a console or PC game. Additionally, most mobile games have a freemium model, where you can play the game for free and then pay for additional features if you want to. This makes mobile games more affordable and accessible to a wider audience.</p><p></p><p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, mobile games are more social than traditional console or PC games. This makes it easy to connect with other players from all over the world and play with them in real-time. This social aspect of mobile gaming is a major reason why it has become so popular in recent years.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fourthly</strong>, mobile games are constantly evolving and improving. Mobile game developers are constantly updating their games with new features, characters, and levels. This means that you never get bored playing the same game over and over again. Additionally, mobile games are always pushing the boundaries of what is possible with mobile technology, making them more immersive and engaging than ever before.</p><p></p><p><strong>Lastly</strong>, mobile games are more environmentally friendly than traditional console or PC games. Most mobile games are digital and can be downloaded directly onto your phone, eliminating the need for physical discs and packaging. This reduces waste and is better for the environment.</p><p></p><p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, mobile games are the future of gaming. They are more accessible, affordable, social, constantly evolving, and environmentally friendly than traditional console or PC games. So the next time you're looking for a way to pass the time, give mobile gaming a try. You won't be disappointed.</p><p></p>Cohesive devices:<p></p>Firstly, secondly, thirdly, fourthly, lastlyAdditionallyThis makesIn conclusionSo<br />
