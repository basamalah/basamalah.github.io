                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Philippine Social Issues.</p><p></p><p>￼￼</p><p></p><p>social issues of Philippines example? and why it is belong to social issues?</p><p></p><p>There are several social issues in the Philippines, some of which include:</p><p></p><p>Poverty: The Philippines has a high poverty rate, with over 20% of the population living below the poverty line. This has led to issues such as malnutrition, lack of access to education and healthcare, and high unemployment rates.</p><p></p><p>Corruption: Corruption is a significant problem in the Philippines, with many politicians and public officials accused of embezzlement, bribery, and other forms of corruption. This has led to a lack of trust in government and institutions, as well as hindered economic growth and development.</p><p></p><p>Human rights abuses: The Philippines has been criticized for its human rights record, particularly in regards to extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, and torture. This has led to concerns over the rule of law and the protection of citizens' rights.</p><p></p><p>Gender inequality: Gender inequality is a significant problem in the Philippines, with women often experiencing discrimination in areas such as employment, education, and healthcare. Violence against women is also a significant issue, with high rates of domestic violence, sexual harassment, and rape.</p><p></p><p>These issues are considered social issues because they affect society as a whole and are often rooted in systemic problems such as poverty, corruption, and inequality. They can also have a wide-ranging impact on the economy, political stability, and social cohesion of the country.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Poverty</strong>: Poverty is a major social issue in the Philippines, with 21.6% of the population living below the national poverty line in 2015. This has led to a lack of access to basic necessities such as food, water, and healthcare for many Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Education</strong>: The quality of education in the Philippines is low compared to other countries in Southeast Asia due to inadequate funding and resources for schools and teachers. This has resulted in high dropout rates and low literacy rates among Filipino children, which can lead to further social issues such as poverty and unemployment later on in life.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Gender Inequality</strong>: Gender inequality is still an issue in the Philippines, with women facing discrimination both socially and economically due to traditional gender roles that are still prevalent today. Women are often underrepresented or excluded from decision-making processes within their communities or workplaces, leading to unequal access to resources and opportunities for advancement compared to men.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope makatulong </p><br />
