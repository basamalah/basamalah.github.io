                        <p>The study about early exposure of teachers in research and its impact on the readiness of grade 11 students in practical research is significant for several reasons:</p><p></p><p>1. Improved teaching quality: When teachers are exposed to research early in their careers, they gain a deeper understanding of current teaching practices and are better equipped to incorporate new teaching strategies and techniques into their classrooms. This, in turn, can lead to improved teaching quality and better learning outcomes for students.</p><p></p><p>2. Increased student engagement: Students who are exposed to practical research at an early age are more likely to develop an interest in science and research, which can lead to greater engagement in their studies and increased motivation to pursue careers in science and technology.</p><p></p><p>3. Better preparation for higher education: Practical research skills are essential for success in higher education, particularly in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). By providing grade 11 students with early exposure to practical research, they will be better prepared for the rigors of higher education and have a greater chance of success.</p><p></p><p>4. Improved research culture: Encouraging teachers to engage in research can help to create a culture of research within schools and educational institutions. This can lead to increased collaboration and knowledge-sharing among teachers and students, which can ultimately benefit the entire education system.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the study on early exposure of teachers in research and its impact on the readiness of grade 11 students in practical research has the potential to improve teaching quality, increase student engagement, better prepare students for higher education, and foster a culture of research within educational institutions.</p><br />

The data show that the inequalities between private schools and government schools are sharpened by the move to online education.
