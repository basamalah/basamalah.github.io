                                            Background Any biological organisms that are not originally found in certain locality are known as invasive species or alien species. Since they are not considered to be native members of a certain population, they could alter the ecological and evolutionary mechanism in the community by competing against environmental requirements or affecting the possible gene flow of those populations that originally inhabiting a certain locale. Situation A certain Filipino agriculture community reported cases of new species that are commonly found in their area. Examples are trees and shrubs found in the highland community forest or new types of freshwater animals that serve as predators in the native fauna of lakes and streams in the community. Generally, these invasive species serve as a threat to the local community but unfortunately, people within the community are unaware of the serious effects of these invasive species. Therefore, a collective citizen science is necessary and as an expert about evolutionary mechanisms and relationships, you are requested to draft a position paper that will be addressed to the local community and policy makers. Task Select one alien species that are already reported in the Philippines. Explain why this was considered as an invasive species and what was the usefulness or harmfulness it had gave in a certain Filipino community. Afterwards, write a local action plan that you will propose to the local policy makers how you are going to inform the general public on a possible long-term impact of these alien species.​</a>

1. What do you think your country's foreign policy goals should be? Do you want to gain power and influence overseas or simply protect your sovereignty? Explain why you think these goals are appropriate, using historical examples.
2. Should the country align itself with NATO, the Warsaw Pact, or the Unaligned Movement? Explain your answer, using historical examples.
3. However the country chooses to align itself, what type of foreign policy should it have toward the rest of the world? Should it be more aggressive or more diplomatic? Explain your answer, using historical examples.
pls answer asap</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>As a country, Karmin's foreign policy goals should primarily focus on protecting its sovereignty and security while also promoting economic growth and stability. This can be achieved through a combination of diplomatic and military means, as well as through economic and trade agreements. Historically, countries that have prioritized their own security and economic prosperity have been able to maintain stability and prosperity for their citizens.In terms of alliances, Karmin should align itself with the Unaligned Movement. This will allow the country to maintain its independence and autonomy in decision-making while also allowing it to form partnerships and alliances on a case-by-case basis. Historically, non-aligned countries have been able to navigate the complexities of international relations more effectively as they are not bound by the constraints of a specific alliance.In terms of foreign policy towards the rest of the world, Karmin should adopt a balanced approach that combines elements of both diplomacy and assertiveness. This approach will enable the country to engage with other nations on a wide range of issues, from trade and economic cooperation to security and defense. However, it is important for the country to be prepared to defend its interests when necessary. This type of foreign policy has been shown to be effective in the past, as demonstrated by countries that have been able to maintain good relations with other nations while also effectively defending their own interests.<p></p><br />

Since they are not considered to be native members of a certain population, they could alter the ecological and evolutionary mechanism in the community by competing against environmental requirements or affecting the possible gene flow of those populations that originally inhabiting a certain locale. Situation A certain Filipino agriculture community reported cases of new species that are commonly found in their area. Examples are trees and shrubs found in the highland community forest or new types of freshwater animals that serve as predators in the native fauna of lakes and streams in the community. Generally, these invasive species serve as a threat to the local community but unfortunately, people within the community are unaware of the serious effects of these invasive species. Therefore, a collective citizen science is necessary and as an expert about evolutionary mechanisms and relationships, you are requested to draft a position paper that will be addressed to the local community and policy makers. Task Select one alien species that are already reported in the Philippines. Explain why this was considered as an invasive species and what was the usefulness or harmfulness it had gave in a certain Filipino community. Afterwards, write a local action plan that you will propose to the local policy makers how you are going to inform the general public on a possible long-term impact of these alien species.​</h2><br />
