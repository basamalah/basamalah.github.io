                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Friends, I wish to say a few words about "Culture".  It is vast topic really. But I will say a little of what I know.</p><p></p><p>Introduction : what is it and what do we understand by saying culture</p><p></p><p>       Culture comprises of all the good ways of living of people in a civilization.  Culture consists of the beliefs, customs, traditions, ethical and moral values of groups of persons.  People with similar culture live together in general.  People of a region have a culture that evolves over many decades.</p><p></p><p>       Culture also means various performing arts like dance, instrumental music, singing, painting, drama, creating writing, craft making, debating, elocution and many more.  These are often characteristic of a civilization.</p><p></p><p>Continuing on :</p><p></p><p>       Culture of a person means the way a person speaks, behaves, responds to various incidents and the conduct of the person including his manners.  Culture has a very important impact on the growth of a person or a society.  When there is no culture, people in the society do not have a common understanding of what is good and what is not good.</p><p></p><p>   Our culture tells us what practices, if we follow, will enable us to live better in our region.  Nowadays, the fast growing India has adopted several cultures and has forgotten many of its traditions and cultures.  The olden traditions and value systems are being forgotten and new values systems are coming in from all parts of the world.  This may be good for some Indians. But respecting one's own culture and upholding is be our responsibility.</p><p></p><p>   The culture is changing from village and small town living style to city and apartment in micro families, shopping malls, pubs, cinemas, entertainment etc.  </p><p></p><p>conclusion :</p><p></p><p>   Often we try to praise western culture and insult our own.  Our culture gives us a great identity.  Be proud of it. Protect it and uphold it. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>“<strong>Culture</strong> is the total way of life that people in the society are blessed with. Culture is the characteristics of a particular <strong>group of people</strong>, defined by everything from language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts. Through culture we are governed by <strong>norms and customs</strong>, which are the pillars of any society. If these pillars are not properly followed in our society, our culture will resemble a perfume with no smell. It’s a gradual existence of presenting those norms and customs to people who surround us through music, dances, arts, crafts, food, dressing style, languages just to mention a few.
</p><p>Culture has been known since man came to an existence and till today we are still practicing it. Through culture we learn how to be better people in the society like living as brothers and sisters. It’s very hard for a person to live without culture because it’s like an antelope at the middle of hungry lioness. A human being is a very complex creature. Every individual human has a distinguished attitude, behaviors as well as traits. It is only through culture where human beings act uniformly and live as a society. Thus, in a simple definition of culture we all agree that culture is a totality way of life of a certain given society as they live and continue to struggle against the nature.  
</p><p>Africa is believed to be the cornerstone of culture and every year, thousands of people from all over the world visit Africa to witness the beautiful culture, history and other amazing natural phenomena which Africa is blessed with and which it cherishes, for instance the earth surface features, wild animals, water bodies as well as hospitality of the people in the continent. Also, food, songs, costumes just to mention a few. Just as we are going to witness in this very day.
</p><p>The way, we Africans handle our lives and whatever surrounds us; that is actually our culture, and it is through which we are identified. However, there are many different cultures from other communities and from other parts of the world, which remain to be the part of great adventure and identity to those people who live in those communities. We also recognize and appreciate their cultures. Wherever you are and wherever you live, your culture is of great value since it is the one which made you to be who you are today. Under no circumstance, a brave should not abandon his or her culture because if one abandons his or her culture, I dare to say he or she would abandon him or herself.
</p><p>It is high time for us to protect all what we have in our culture and whatever is good should be taken to great heights and we should try all our level best to eliminate all those practices which are against human rights even if they have been practiced in our culture for centuries. Practices such as female genital mutilation, discrimination of any kind, torture to women and children and any kind of maltreatment to our society members. Culture is not static, it changes as the human being develops so let us not be prisoners of our own culture.
</p><p>For those who have been here for four years will agree with us that we have been improving always from our first Cultural Day in 2010, 2011 and last year. The event is about commemorating our culture and other cultures beyond our boarders and beyond our continent. It must be well understood that, preserving our culture doesn’t mean to disrespect other peoples’ cultures. Cultures create and develop identities.
</p><p>God bless Africa, God bless Tanzania, and God bless St Jude.
</p><p>Remember, “Jasiri haachi asili,” The brave do not abandon their culture.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that define a group of people. Every community has its unique culture that shapes their way of life and interactions with others. It influences their language, food, clothing, music, arts, and religion.</p><p></p><p>Beliefs are the ideas or convictions that a community holds to be true.

Beliefs can shape attitudes, behaviors, and decision-making processes.</p><p></p><p>Traditions are the customs or practices that have been passed down from generation to generation. They can be cultural, religious, or family-oriented. Traditions help to maintain the identity and heritage of a community and provide a sense of continuity and belonging.</p><p></p><p>Cohesive devices are linguistic tools used to connect sentences, paragraphs, and ideas within a text. They include pronouns, conjunctions, adverbs, and transitional phrases. Cohesive devices help to create a flow and coherence in writing and improve its readability.</p><p></p><p>For example, the use of conjunctions such as "however," "therefore," and "in addition" can connect contrasting or complementary ideas in a text. The use of pronouns such as "they" or "it" can refer to previously mentioned subjects, avoiding repetition and maintaining coherence. Adverbs such as "nevertheless" or "consequently" can signal a shift in the direction or tone of a text.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the culture, beliefs, and traditions of a community are essential aspects that define their way of life and interactions with others.

In this period of time Vietnamese was written with Chữ Hán, a Chinese script, and afterward a Vietnamese script (Chữ Nôm) that was based on Chinese, but which included invented characters to represent native Vietnamese words. This large impact on Vietnamese culture means that Vietnam is often considered to be part of the East Asian cultural sphere (with China, Taiwan, South Korea, North Korea, and Japan).[3]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ima not sure i see this in my research djike</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I was born in rural Missouri, but my family moved to St. Louis before I was a year old. My mother is 100 percent Irish and comes from a family that identifies very strongly with Irish culture. My father is Middle Eastern, but was adopted by an English family who moved to the United States when he was 5. We lived in a pretty big house in a subdivision. My parents had two more kids after me, they were both boys as well. My father wasn't religious, but my mom was a practicing Catholic. She went to mass every week. My brothers and I both had first communion and were confirmed, but stopped going to church as teenagers. We weren't really encouraged to play sports because our parents thought we should focus on our studies. They really emphasized math and science. I did well in these classes, but I didn't enjoy them. In high school, I became active in music and theater. Most of my friends were also into that as well. I earned a scholarship to study engineering on the East Coast, but I dropped out as a sophomore. I returned home to study music, needless to say my parents were disappointed. My brothers both pursued careers in technical fields. One is a mechanical engineer and the other is a software engineer. I am close with my family, but we do not have much in common. My circle of friends is fairly varied when it comes to race, ethnicity, religion, and economic background, but it consists almost entirely of people who are artists, musicians, writers, or people involved in those industries.</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that your essay may look nothing like this. In our example, the writers choice of career, talents, and interests influenced his cultural identity more than his religious, ethnic background, or family values did. This may not be the case for you. Remember that when you are writing your paper there are no wrong answers. You just have to ask yourself insightful questions and keep the theory of cultural identity in mind as you write. Here are some questions to ask yourself:</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope this helps because this speech is becoming a presidential speech</p><br />

As Africans became literate in their own languages, they often reacted against colonial repression in their writings. Others looked to their own past for subjects.

                        Dear friends,<br /><br />Today, I want to talk about the importance of resilience in learning and how showcasing skills and talents in culture and arts and technology can contribute to building this resilience.<br /><br />As we all know, learning can be a challenging and sometimes even a frustrating process. We encounter difficulties and setbacks that can make us want to give up. However, resilience is the ability to bounce back from these setbacks, to persevere through challenges, and to continue moving forward towards our goals.<br /><br />One way to develop resilience is through the showcasing of our skills and talents in culture, arts, and technology. When we have the opportunity to demonstrate our abilities in these areas, we are building our self-confidence and self-esteem. We are also able to receive feedback and recognition for our accomplishments, which can motivate us to continue pushing ourselves and developing our skills.<br /><br />Culture and arts can provide a unique outlet for individuals to express themselves and to connect with others. By participating in cultural activities and creating art, we can develop a sense of belonging and community. These activities can also be a source of inspiration and comfort during difficult times, helping us to cope with stress and adversity.<br /><br />Technology is another area where individuals can showcase their skills and talents. In today's digital age, technology is an essential part of our lives, and those who are proficient in this area have a distinct advantage. By learning to code, develop apps, or design websites, individuals can create innovative solutions to real-world problems, and make a positive impact on their communities and society.<br /><br />In conclusion, showcasing skills and talents in culture and arts and technology can help individuals develop resilience in learning. By participating in these activities, we can build self-confidence, receive recognition for our accomplishments, develop a sense of community, and create innovative solutions to real-world problems. Let us embrace these opportunities and continue to grow and develop as individuals. Thank you.<br />
