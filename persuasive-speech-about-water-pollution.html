                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good morning everyone!</p><p></p><p>My name is [name], and I am here today to talk to you about why you should stay in your evacuate area in the face of disaster.</p><p></p><p>Now, I know this may seem like a difficult concept to understand. It's common to want to escape danger and seek safety, but sometimes staying put is the best choice for you and your family.</p><p></p><p>The first thing to consider is the cost involved in evacuation. Taking a family away from their home and finding alternative housing can be expensive. Leaving your home may also mean leaving behind your belongings. It may also mean taking children out of school and disrupting their normal routines.</p><p></p><p>The second benefit of staying in your evacuate area is that some of the infrastructure may still be salvageable even after a disaster. Power, water and other vital services may be available and ready to be used, therefore reducing the cost of rebuilding.</p><p></p><p>The third benefit is the sense of community. People who stay in the evacuate area are likely to band together in order to rebuild their homes and their lives. This can create a strong bond between you and your new neighbours which can be invaluable following a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Finally, staying put can actually be the safest option in some cases. It can be safer to stay in your home rather than attempting to evacuate an unstable area. In addition, staying put may be the only option if you have special needs that require electricity or other services that are not available elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I urge you to consider the cost, benefits, and safety when making a decision about staying or evacuating. In some cases, staying put can actually be the best choice. So please, take the time to evaluate your situation and make the decision that's best for you and your loved ones.</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><p>here↑</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>Today, I want to talk to you about a critical issue that affects us all: evacuating an area in times of emergency. In particular, I want to persuade those of you who may be hesitant to evacuate during a crisis that it is vital to do so.</p><p></p><p>I understand that leaving your home and possessions behind can be a daunting prospect, but sometimes, it is necessary to preserve your life and the lives of your loved ones. In the face of natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, staying behind can be a fatal decision. Therefore, I implore you to take the necessary steps to evacuate when advised to do so.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it is essential to remember that emergency personnel, such as firefighters and rescue workers, are trained to handle these situations. They are there to help, but they need you to follow their instructions. If they ask you to evacuate, it is because they believe that it is in your best interest to do so. By staying behind, you not only put yourself at risk but also those who may have to rescue you.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, your home can be replaced, but your life cannot. No material possession is worth risking your life for. Your house, your car, your belongings can all be replaced, but your life is precious and irreplaceable. It is vital to value your life above all else.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, when you evacuate, you are not alone. You are part of a community that is facing the same crisis, and the evacuation center is there to help you. The center provides food, shelter, and medical care if needed. You will have access to resources that will help you and your family through this difficult time.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I urge you all to take evacuation orders seriously. Remember that your life is precious, and emergency personnel are there to help. Do not hesitate to evacuate when advised to do so. By doing so, you will not only be saving your life but also that of your loved ones. Thank you.</p><br />

But with the world's population increasing and climate change causing more droughts, our water supply is becoming increasingly scarce. </p><p></p><p>That's why it's so important that we all take steps to live more sustainably. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can reduce our water consumption and help preserve this vital resource for future generations. </p><p></p><p>For example, one way to save water is by taking shorter showers. A five-minute shower uses about 25 gallons of water, while a 10-minute shower uses up to 50 gallons! So if you can cut your shower time in half, you'll be saving a lot of water each day. </p><p></p><p>Another way to conserve water is by using low-flow fixtures in your home. Low-flow toilets and faucets use less water than traditional fixtures, so they're a great way to reduce your water usage without sacrificing comfort or convenience. </p><p></p><p>Finally, you can also save water by using rain barrels or other rainwater collection systems. This will allow you to collect rainwater for use in your garden or other outdoor activities instead of relying on municipal sources of water which are often overused and polluted. </p><p></p><p>These are just a few of the ways that we can all work together to conserve this precious resource and ensure its availability for future generations. So let's all do our part and be the change by living more sustainably! Thank you for listening!</p><br />

                            14. Write a persuasive speech about "Be the Change: Sustainable Lifestyle To Save
Water"</h2><br />
                        <p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p></p><p>Water is one of the most essential resources on our planet. It sustains life, nourishes our bodies, and helps to grow the food we eat. However, despite its importance, our water resources are being depleted at an alarming rate. Climate change, pollution, and unsustainable consumption patterns are all contributing to the depletion of our water resources. We must take action to save water and preserve this precious resource for future generations.</p><p></p><p>One of the most effective ways we can save water is by adopting a sustainable lifestyle. By making small changes to our daily habits, we can reduce our water consumption and help to protect our planet. Here are some simple steps we can take:</p><p></p><p>First, reduce your water usage at home. This can be done by turning off the tap when you are brushing your teeth, fixing any leaky faucets, and taking shorter showers. By reducing the amount of water you use at home, you can make a significant impact on your water usage.</p><p></p><p>Second, consider the products you use and the impact they have on water resources. For example, opt for eco-friendly laundry detergents and dish soaps that are biodegradable and phosphate-free. By choosing sustainable products, you can reduce the amount of harmful chemicals that end up in our waterways.</p><p></p><p>Third, make changes to your diet. Eating a plant-based diet can significantly reduce your water footprint, as meat production requires much more water than plant-based foods. By reducing your consumption of meat and dairy, you can save water and reduce your carbon footprint.</p><p></p><p>Finally, advocate for change in your community. Speak up about the importance of water conservation, and encourage others to adopt sustainable practices. By working together, we can create a culture of sustainability and protect our water resources for future generations.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, we all have a responsibility to protect our planet and preserve our water resources. By adopting a sustainable lifestyle, we can make a difference and create a brighter future for ourselves and future generations. So, let's be the change we want to see in the world, and start living sustainably today. Thank you.</p><br />

But nature is not only about the free resources around us. It also includes <strong>weather</strong>, good or bad. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Just this year, <strong>more than ten earthquakes</strong> and typhoons have already visited the Philippines. Most number of earthquakes than have ever been listed in the country. Where are these disastrous quakes coming from? What makes them? <strong>Who makes them.</strong> Think. It’s us, humans. Over the years, written in our science books is forbidding the burning of plastics because it will cause the ozone layer to have holes and the <strong>ultra violet rays</strong> to heat the earth. We all know that these rays will cause<strong> climate change</strong> and yet, <strong>burning plastics</strong> have just become ordinary. Minings are everywhere and now the earth is suffering from <strong>climate change.</strong> The earth is still intact my friends. We can still <strong>stop whatever worse </strong>is yet to come. Hand in hand, let’s <strong>save the earth</strong> and the nature that serve us. Let’s plant trees and clean the rivers and seas.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>      Journalism plays a significant role in any place or country. It is the primary source of information of what is happening around the globe. However, I believe, the significant role of journalism vanishes if it is not "true" journalism.</p><p>      True journalism is a kind of journalism which upholds not only excellence and quality, but also justness and fairness. And to me, ABS-CBN is not even close to giving just and fair news at all times. Hence, the network should be shutdown.</p><p>       The act of ABS-CBN not showing true journalism is enough reason to shut it down. Such kind of journalism like of ABS-CBN's has certainly no place in the country. It should be stopped already so that it would not be able to create and report or present unjust and unfair news to people. The people deserve quality, excellent and most importantly just and fair news presenting. And any media outlet who cannot provide such should be shutdown to paralyze and disable them to further influence the people with unjust and unfair information and or news.</p><p>          Unjust and unfair news reporting should be stopped already. A lot of medias out there who are still doing such things, and it is now the right time to show those medias that the government is not tolerating such actions. ABS-CBN should be shutdown. Shut down ABS-CBN and significant change could happen in the kind of journalism the Philippines has.</p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>--------------</p><p>Techniques in writing persuasive essay.

                        <p>I would start with some examples of individuals destroyed, driven to suicide by cyber bullying. Go straight into it; “Sally was an honors student in medicine, highly praised for her intellect and loved by her friends and family. Great things were expected of her. She might one day cure cancer… But she never will. She is dead. Cyber bullying killed her…”
</p><p>
</p><p>Don’t drag them on too long, because the idea is to pepper the audience with quick examples so they understand the issue is not with what happened to one or a few people, but that this is endemic and happens frequently. List three or four such examples, citing something that personalizes the individual to create empathy (similar to what I wrote above), the sort of attacks they were subject to using adjectives for accent, and finally the horror that resulted.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then mention statistics to show how these are not isolated incidents. Use voice inflection and dramatic pauses for emphases.
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally delve into a personal story of how it has affected you or someone close to you. This need not and likely should not be one of suicide (unless someone close to you ‘has’ been pushed that far). The emphases in this should be the emotional pain. Do what you need to do for the audience to fully appreciate the depth of it. Belabor the lasting effect this has had on you and/or your friends.
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point, your audience should be primed to hear whatever you have to say about how to address the problem. They may not agree with your proposed solutions, but they almost certainly will agree with the need that it be addressed.</p><br />

                            27. Persuasive Essay : Persuade residence to stay in a evacuation areas (a speech)​</h2><br />
                        <p>Good afternoon and thank you for coming. I am here to discuss the necessity of staying in evacuation areas during emergency times. As a university academician, I have done extensive research on the topic, and the facts and figures I am about to present to you should help illustrate the seriousness of the issue.</p><p></p><p>Let us begin by taking a look at the data of the initial damage inflicted by natural disasters. It has been determined that lives and property are most threatened in the initial stages of a disaster. By far the greatest destruction is not caused by the actual disaster itself, but rather by the destruction caused by people fleeing. This can be attributed to the displacement of people, disrupting the flow of goods and services in the market and the destruction of property during relocation.</p><p></p><p>Hence, the first way in which staying in evacuation areas can help is that it can lessen the destruction caused by displacement. The benefit here is two-fold: it reduces the destruction caused by people evacuating and it reduces the destruction caused by the disaster itself.</p><p></p><p>Another key reason for staying in evacuation areas is the improved access to assistance. Many disaster relief organizations are set up only in evacuation areas which offer temporary housing, medical and other services. By staying in these areas, you increase the chances of getting immediate assistance both during and after the disaster.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, staying in evacuation areas reduces the impact of the current disaster as well as the dangers of future disasters. First, by having people stay in these areas, there is less disruption to the market and government services which can lead to a swift return to normalcy. Second, by having people stay in these areas during one disaster, it will incentivize them to do the same for future disasters, thus reducing the toll of displacement on property and people in the future.</p><p></p><p>All of this just goes to highlight the importance of staying in evacuation areas during times of disaster. Yes, it can be uncomfortable and inconvenient, but it is the responsible thing to do both for yourself and for the community. Staying in evacuation areas helps reduce the destruction caused by displacement and improves access to assistance. Moreover, it also reduces the impact of the current disaster and risks of future disasters. Therefore, I urge you to think of your safety and the safety of others by staying in evacuation areas when a disaster strikes. Thank you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, success is something that we all strive for in life, but what does success truly mean? Success is subjective and can mean different things to different people. Some may see success as financial stability, others may see it as a fulfilling personal life, and still others may see it as a combination of both.</p><p></p><p>No matter what success means to you, there are a few key traits and habits that successful people have in common. One of the most important is determination. Successful people are not afraid of failure and they do not give up easily. They are willing to put in the hard work and make the sacrifices necessary to achieve their goals.</p><p></p><p>Another key trait of successful people is the ability to stay focused. They are able to set clear goals and keep their eye on the prize, no matter what distractions or obstacles come their way. They understand that success is not a destination, but a journey, and they are willing to put in the effort every day to get closer to their goals.</p><p></p><p>Finally, successful people are also positive and optimistic. They see the glass as half full and they focus on the opportunities, rather than the challenges. They are able to bounce back from setbacks and maintain a positive attitude, even when things get tough.</p><p></p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, success is not something that just falls into our laps. It takes hard work, determination, focus, and a positive attitude. If you have these traits, then you have what it takes to be successful. So embrace your dreams, believe in yourself, and never give up. Success is within your reach, and with determination and hard work, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#<strong>pabrainliest</strong></p><p>#<strong>FOLLOW</strong></p><p>#<strong>CARRYONLEARNING</strong> </p><br />
