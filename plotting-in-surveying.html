As the sample size n increases without limit, the shape of the distribution become less normal. 12. The mean of the sample is equal to the mean of the population 13. The variance of the sampling distribution is equal to the population variance multiplied by the sample size. 14. The value of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is always greater than the standard deviation of the population. 15. Another name for the standard deviation of a distribution of means is the standard error of the mean 16. The sampling distribution of the mean is a plot of sample means drawn from a population. 17. The sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normally distributed only when the sample is small 18. You draw successive random samples of nine participants from a population, calculate the mean of each sample, and plot the sample means. If the population has a mean of 12 and a standard deviation of 6, the standard deviation of your distribution is 2. 19. Samples of size 25 are selected from a population with mean 40 and standard deviation 7.5. The mean of the sampling distribution of sample means is 40. 20. A survey will be given to 100 students randomly selected from the freshmen class at Lincoln High School. The population will be all freshmen at Lincoln High School.​</a>

                        <p>Since we know that the area of the triangular plot is 4,000 square meters, and the triangular plot is a right triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a right triangle to solve for the missing leg. The formula for the area of a right triangle is:</p><p></p><p>Area = 1/2 * base * height</p><p></p><p>where the base and height are the two legs of the right triangle.</p><p></p><p>Let x be the length of the missing leg.

As the sample size n increases without limit, the shape of the distribution become less normal. 12. The mean of the sample is equal to the mean of the population 13. The variance of the sampling distribution is equal to the population variance multiplied by the sample size. 14. The value of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is always greater than the standard deviation of the population. 15. Another name for the standard deviation of a distribution of means is the standard error of the mean 16. The sampling distribution of the mean is a plot of sample means drawn from a population. 17. The sampling distribution of the mean becomes approximately normally distributed only when the sample is small 18. You draw successive random samples of nine participants from a population, calculate the mean of each sample, and plot the sample means. If the population has a mean of 12 and a standard deviation of 6, the standard deviation of your distribution is 2. 19. Samples of size 25 are selected from a population with mean 40 and standard deviation 7.5. The mean of the sampling distribution of sample means is 40. 20. A survey will be given to 100 students randomly selected from the freshmen class at Lincoln High School. The population will be all freshmen at Lincoln High School.​</h2><br />

Defining what you really want to know , stating the problems you need to solve , and deciding what project do you like to have are important considerations in preparing what step of survey.3. Do not mix fruits, classify them according to ripeness, size, and shape. This must be observed to maintain the good condition and quality of products. 4. The process can be done in 7 to 15 days before transplanting to make the tissue of the plants firmer and survive the rigors of transplanting. 5. It is the process where seedling is transferred from the seed box or other containers to the ground or plot for growth, development, and production. 6. What elements to be observed in planting trees are being described by: choose the right place for planting, select seeds that best suited for both soil and the seasons and apply the right kind and amount of fertilizer? 7. Usually done through picking when fruits are mature enough and ready to be sold to the market fresh and in good condition. 8. It refers to consumers or buyers' attitude on how much they want a certain product in a given period of  time. 9. Trees and fruit-bearing trees need vitamins and minerals for their growth. These elements are found in the soil but are improved when mixed with either organic or inorganic materials. 10.
