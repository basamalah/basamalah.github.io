                                            Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the lived experiences and struggles of 22, on-campus working students of ISAT U-Miagao Campus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants' dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helping these students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.tittle:author/s: kind:strength:Weakness:importance:pahelp naman sa pr1 namin huhu​</a>

I needed something I could control and grades provided that for me. The research perspective I learned in classes also made me feel more in control at doctor and therapy appointments. Around Finn's third birthday, he reached age level on all developmental and physical tasks. I transitioned from being a caregiver to "just" a parent. The shift was profound. It had a significant impact on my lived experience as a parent, my lived experience as a student, and my lived experience of health. The worry that consumed me, and the exhaustion I felt as a caregiver dissipated when my role was reduced to parent. I was able to focus on my studies in a more balanced way and I had the energy to build relationships with fellow students in my program. I have the benefit of understanding the experience of being a student as both a caregiver and as a non-cargegiver. My personal experience as a student caregiver, combined with my academic path in student affairs, sowed the seeds for this phenomenological study</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps, make me as a brainliest</p><br />
