One day, Armida and her mother were admiring some newly hatched chicks. Armida picked up one and held it tightly that it almost smothered. It struggled to escape from Armida’s hold. Casually her mother said, “If you hold a chick too tightly, it wants only to get away. Try holding one gently.”	The next chick nestled peacefully in Armida’s open palm. Her mother said, “You know dear, people are the same as chicks. If we hold those whom we love too closely to us, they will struggle for freedom. Hold them with open hands and they won’t feel smothered or suffocated.	Armida understood the message in her mother’s words.

Theme is the meaning or concept left to the readers after reading a piece of fiction. A theme usually depicts and unifies the central topic of the story. It gives the reader a deeper significance of the work to people's day to day lives. Moral/lesson of the story is not the theme of the story. Theme is the author's way of sharing ideas, perceptions, and feelings with readers, and it may be directly stated or it may only be implied. The theme unifies the concept of the story. It must adhere to the following requirements: 1. The theme must account all the major details of the story. 2. The theme must not be contradicted by any detail of the story. 3. It must not only rely on supposed facts- facts not actually stated or clearly implied by the story. Furthermore, let us take time and consider some suggestions in creating a theme of a work of literature by Laurence and Thomas Arp, 1993. 1. Theme should be expressed in a statement form having a subject and predicate. 2. Theme must be stated as a generalization about life. 3. Do not make the generalization larger (or smaller) than is justified by the terms of the story. 4. Theme unifies the concept of a story. Therefore, a theme accounts all the major details of the story, it is not contradicted by any detail of a story and it does not rely upon supposed facts. 5. There is no single way of stating a theme. 6. Avoid using statement that reduces the theme to some familiar saying, proverb, or axiom. HOME BASED ACTIVITIES TASK 1: CHARACTER SKETCH BE LIKE!

                            22. vainly to warn Snow White, knowing what will happen when she bites into the apple. This shows dramatic irony. G. Theme. Theme is the meaning or concept left to the readers after reading a piece of fiction. A theme usually depicts and unifies the central topic of the story. It gives the reader a deeper significance of the work to people's day to day lives. Moral/lesson of the story is not the theme of the story. Theme is the author's way of sharing ideas, perceptions, and feelings with readers, and it may be directly stated or it may only be implied. The theme unifies the concept of the story. It must adhere to the following requirements: 1. The theme must account all the major details of the story. 2. The theme must not be contradicted by any detail of the story. 3. It must not only rely on supposed facts- facts not actually stated or clearly implied by the story. Furthermore, let us take time and consider some suggestions in creating a theme of a work of literature by Laurence and Thomas Arp, 1993. 1. Theme should be expressed in a statement form having a subject and predicate. 2. Theme must be stated as a generalization about life. 3. Do not make the generalization larger (or smaller) than is justified by the terms of the story. 4. Theme unifies the concept of a story. Therefore, a theme accounts all the major details of the story, it is not contradicted by any detail of a story and it does not rely upon supposed facts. 5. There is no single way of stating a theme. 6. Avoid using statement that reduces the theme to some familiar saying, proverb, or axiom. HOME BASED ACTIVITIES TASK 1: CHARACTER SKETCH BE LIKE!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Paragraph 1:</p>Biased word: "best"Explanation: The word "best" is a biased word because it implies that the Philippines is superior to other countries as a tourist destination. While it is possible that Amira may have a personal preference for her home country, the statement does not acknowledge that different people may have different opinions about what makes a place the "best" to visit.<p></p><p>Paragraph 2:</p>Biased word: "all"Explanation: The word "all" is a biased word because it implies that every mother has an innate understanding of their child's needs through their crying. While it is true that mothers often develop a better understanding of their child's communication over time, not every mother may have the same level of intuition or experience.<p></p><p>Paragraph 3:</p>Biased word: "forgotten"Explanation: The word "forgotten" is a biased word because it implies that the youth of this era are entirely at fault for neglecting the virtue of obedience. It fails to consider external factors such as changing cultural values or societal pressures that may contribute to the lack of obedience in younger generations.<p></p><p>Paragraph 4:</p>Biased word: "outstanding"Explanation: The word "outstanding" is a biased word because it suggests that Roberto's public service was exceptional and noteworthy. While he may have been a good public servant, the statement does not provide any evidence or objective criteria to support the claim that he was "outstanding." Additionally, the statement portrays Roberto's family as dedicated to public service without acknowledging any potential biases or privileges that may have contributed to their success.<p></p><p></p><br />

They weremean to Cinderella, making her work all day cleaning, sewing, and cooking. She tried her best tomake them happy.Cinderella's stepmother, Lady Tremaine, was cold, cruel, and jealous of Cinderella's charmand beauty. She enjoyed giving Cinderella extra chores to do, such as Bathing her cat, Lucifer.One day, a messenger arrived with a special invitation. There was going to be a royal ball atthe palace! The King wanted his son to find a bride. Every young woman in the kingdom wasinvited—including Cinderella!Cinderella was very excited about the ball. In the attic, she found a dress that had belongedto her mother. It was a bit old-fashioned, but Cinderella could make it beautiful. Lady Tremaine didn'twant Cinderella to go the ball. She wanted the Prince to meet Anastasia and Drizella. Maybe hewould marry one of them. Lady Tremaine kept Cinderella busy with chores that would take her allnight to finish.While Cinderella was working, the mice and birds fixed her dress. They added ribbons andbeads thatv the two stepsisters had thrown away. Working together, the animals turned a simpledress into a fabulous gown! Cinderella was overjoyed when she saw the dress. Now she could goto the ball! "Oh, thank you so much!" Cinderella said to Guz, Jaq, and the birds. They ripped thedress and pulled off the beads. Lady Tremaine didn't stop them. Cinderella's dream of going to theball was throughCinderella run away to the garden to cry. Suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared. With awave of her wand, she turned a pumpkin into an elegant coach. Cinderella could now go to the ball,but her dress was still ruined. "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!" said the Fairy Godmother, waving her wandagain. Cinderella was now wearing a beautiful gown and sparkling glass slippers. But all pof thiscame with a warning: When the clock struck midnight, the magic spell would wear off!At the ball, Prince Charming couldn't take his eyes off Cinderella. The orchestra played, andthe Prince began to dance with the wonderful girl whose name he still didn't know. For Cinderella,the night was a dream come true. Before too long, the clock began to strike midnight. "Good-bye!"Cinderella said, hurrying away."Come back!" called the Prince." I don't even know your name! As Cinderella fled, one of herglass slippers came off. Then Lady Tremaine tripped the Grand Duke, and the glass slippersshattered... but Cinderalla had other in her pocket. And if fit!
