                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I chose this study because I am interested in understanding how senior high school students perceive the new normal educational system. This new system of learning has been implemented in many countries around the world as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is important to understand how students are adapting to this new way of learning. By understanding the perceptions of senior high school students on the new normal educational system, we can better understand how to support them in this transition and ensure that they are receiving the best education possible.</p><p></p><p>2. To collect data for this research topic, I used a variety of sources, including surveys, interviews, focus groups, and online forums. I also consulted with experts in the field to get their views on the topic. Additionally, I used existing research and reports on the topic to gain further insight into the perceptions of senior high school students on the new normal educational system.</p><p></p><p>3.The primary audience for this research would be educators, school administrators, and policy makers. Additionally, parents and students might be interested in the results of this research, as it could provide valuable insights into how they can best adjust to the new normal educational system.</p><p></p><p>4. One of the most surprising research findings was that the majority of senior high school students reported feeling positive about the new normal educational system. This was contrary to the expectations of many educators and parents, who had assumed that the transition to online learning would be difficult for students. However, the research found that students felt that the new system was more flexible and allowed them to better manage their time and workload.</p><p></p><p>5. I chose this respondent because they were able to provide an in-depth perspective on how senior high school students are perceiving the new normal educational system. The respondent was able to provide an honest and unbiased opinion on the topic, which was invaluable in understanding the issues and challenges that senior high school students are facing with the new normal educational system.</p><p></p><p>6. From my study, I learned that the senior high school students have mixed feelings about the new normal educational system. On the one hand, they are appreciative of the increased flexibility and convenience of learning from home. On the other hand, they are concerned about the lack of social interaction, the difficulties of staying focused, and the potential loss of academic opportunities. Additionally, some students expressed feelings of loneliness and isolation due to the lack of face-to-face contact with their classmates and teachers.</p><p></p><p>7. The topic of perception of the senior high school on the new normal educational system is an important one to discuss because it can provide insight into how students and teachers are adapting to the changes brought about by the pandemic. It can also provide insight into how schools are responding to the challenges posed by the new normal and the potential issues that may arise. Understanding the perceptions of students and teachers can help inform decisions about how to best support students and teachers during this difficult time.</p><p>Why did you choose this study?</p>The study was chosen to understand the perception of senior high school students on the new normal educational system, particularly on the shift to online or blended learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<p>What sources did you use for data collection?</p>The sources used for data collection may vary depending on the research methodology. Common sources include surveys, interviews, focus group discussions, and secondary data from government agencies, academic institutions, and online platforms.<p>Who will be most interested in your research?</p>Educators, policy-makers, students, and parents will be most interested in the research findings to gain insights into the challenges and opportunities of implementing the new normal educational system.<p>What research finding surprised you?</p>Research findings that may be surprising to some include the digital divide among students, the impact of online learning on students' mental health and well-being, and the effectiveness of online assessment tools.<p>Why did you choose this respondent?</p>The choice of respondents may depend on the research objectives and sampling method. The study may involve a random sample of senior high school students or a purposive sample of students from specific schools or regions.<p>What did you learn from your study?</p>The study may provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the new normal educational system, the challenges faced by students in adapting to online or blended learning, and the best practices for promoting student engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes.<p>What are the reasons for choosing this topic?</p>The topic is relevant and timely as it addresses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education sector, particularly on senior high school students. The study may help identify strategies for enhancing the quality and accessibility of education in the new normal.<br />

​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. i would choose to prioritize studying. it is the very foundation of everything. it provides great opportunities and lessons that we need in a daily life basis. if you're talented, educated and well mannered, you'll be rich not only with the money and wealth but also with knowledge and wisdom that you've gained from studying.</p><p>b. face to face instruction is more effective compared to modular distance learning. in the face to face instruction, there's interaction between the students and the teachers which allows the students to comprehend even more and they/we are not distracted with different stuff going on around us.</p><p>C. it would be on the health and/or education. the welfare of the people is what matters most and should be given attention. as well as the education that will serve as the way for less fortunate people to uplift themselves and to defend themselves from people who'll try to take advantage of their weaknesses.</p><p>2. no, it is not that difficult because these questions are timely and somehow relatable.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope this helps </p><br />
