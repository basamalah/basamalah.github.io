                        <p>Goodwill speeches are those that seek to introduce oneself or entity to another group, organization, or even country, while at the same time building a goodwill relationship with that audience.</p><br />

                        I found this somewhere...<br /><br />Appreciate every 
sacrifice of a person.This is so true to our community today that one's 
sacrifice is forgotten along with the person's death. This is the moral 
lesson that the story of Keesh wanted to convey. Keesh was a brave young
 boy who wanted to continue his father's desires--to feed his countrymen
 and save them from hunger. <br />Being inspired with his father's tale as
 a great huntsman, he make himself brave and continued the legendary 
exploits of his late father. <br />Even at his young age, he was able to make history,whereby people remembered him as a skilled and great huntsman. <br /><br /><br /><br />

                            7. What is the goodwill for keesh</h2><br />
                        Keesh was thirteen 
years old . He was the son of Bok, a great huntsman,
 who desired to feed his fellowmen to fight hunger. He, as a sole son 
wanted to continue his father's will. He was a young boy with a big 
heart for his countrymen. He spoke against the council after sharing his
 sentiments that he and his countrymen is suffering-- unfair division of
 meat. <br />After being ridiculed by other villagers and being scorned by
 the council, he set forth to hunt alone. Few days after, he returned 
with an ice bear and two cubs on his shoulders, freshly-killed polar 
bears. <br />The council doubted his hunting. He was spied and accused, 
but, after revealing the mystery of his marvelous hunting, he was awed 
and recognized by everybody.<br /><br />Keesh was truly a great huntsman not
 because of his skills and devised means in hunting, but because he was 
hunting to feed his countrymen. He was an inspiration to everybody to 
become great hunters. <br /><br /><br />

                        <p>In this special occasion I want to say thank you to all sponsors who has helped us, the Goodwillers, so that we can continue our study and being a better and competitive student. Then I thank to Ibu Mien as the Chairperson of Yayasan Goodwill International and our beloved Mbak Rosa and Pak Broto who never feel tired to help us in every goodwill session.</p><p>So I want to use this opportunity to share two stories to you. The first one is how did The Goodwill program affected me and shaped me a to be better student. The second one is my experience in performing Saman Dance in Ohio University last year.</p><p>Since July 2010, I received a scholarship from Goodwill. I was so happy because I can help my parents to afford my study. Then I became happier after I attended a lot of training provided by Goodwill. Those training helped me to find my own voice and pushed me to do more than I’ve never realized before. Goodwill training has enhanced my skills in writing and speaking in English. But not only that, a leadership training that was held in October last year has motivated me to do more than before.</p><p>Now, I’ve finished my final research and graduated. But the training that I’ve said before convinced me to do more than just finishing my final research. What I’ve done? My research was aimed to produce a biodegradable styrofoam from corn and cassava starch. I wrote my proposal research in English than I submitted my proposal to Japan. Alhamdulillah, Thanks to God. My proposal was one among 10 best proposal that received a funding from Tokyotech Indonesia Commitment Award. I was also surprised that I got another achievement. My proposal was also selected as the best 50 proposal in Student Innovation Award 2011 held in Japan. I know that maybe I can never achieved all of them without Goodwill training. So once again, I want to say thank you the sponsors and Goodwill staff.<br />Let me continue to my second story. Last year I received a scholarship form US Department of State to study in Ohio University for two months. The program was named IELSP (Indonesia English Language Study Program). Two weeks before we went back to Indonesia, there was an International Street Fair in Ohio University. In that fair, every international student had an opportunity to show their talents and art performance. Indonesian Student Union helped us to performed Saman Dance in the fair. Four weeks before the fair, we had already started the preparation. We trained the dance and the music twice a week after class and we also prepared the costumes. During we were preparing the dance, there were two young women and one man from Taiwan, Argentina and USA who were interested to join us. We were so happy and proud because they really appreciate our own culture and want to learn how to perform the Saman Dance.</p><p>Finally the day came. Every country had their own art performance such as belly dance, samba dance, percussion music performance, and many more. In addition, each country also had a stand to sell their handy craft or traditional food. Before noon, our turn was come. We went to the stage and start performing. Beyond our expectation, there were a lot of people stopped their activity and came to the front of the stage to watched our performance. Some of them was videotaping us while the other never stop clapping. When our performance was finished the crowd gave us a very big applause. On the following day, our picture became the header of the official website of Ohio University and the news in the newspaper talking about our performance. Start from that experience, I realized that it is not enough for us to just being proud of our national art and culture and doing nothing. We should do more by learning and practicing at least one of them. Because it is the most effective way to preserve our culture. I heard that there are some of the Goodwillers who will perform a music performance today. So let’s support them.</p><p>That is one of the goodwill speech examples.</p><p><br /></p><br />

                        Keesh was a young brave man who made a history in his village. <br />He
 wanted to give honor to his father's memory as a man who risk his life 
to feed his fellow villagers.  Being inspired to his father's notable 
deed, he emboldened himself and proved that he can do great as his 
father. Even if he was ridiculed,scorned, and doubted, Keesh was 
encouraged to hunt alone. His courage and will to continue his father's 
deeds made him more determined to be successful in hunting.<br /><br />We can say that Keesh was

                        Appreciate every sacrifice of a person.This is so true to our community today that one's sacrifice is forgotten along with the person's death. This is the moral lesson that the story of Keesh wanted to convey. Keesh was a brave young boy who wanted to continue his father's desires--to feed his countrymen and save them from hunger. <br />Being inspired with his father's tale as a great huntsman, he make himself brave and continued the legendary exploits of his late father. <br />Even at his young age, he was able to make history,whereby people remembered him as a skilled and great huntsman.   <br /><br /><br />

Keesh wanted to air their concern but the council made him a laughing stock by ordering him to go to bed for he is still a little boy. He talked against the council by sharing his late father's goodwill. His late father Bok, was a great hunter who wanted to give a fair share of meat. Keesh admitted the fact that they received a share of meat but it was often old and tough and had many bones. <br /><br />

                        <p>“<strong>Culture</strong> is the total way of life that people in the society are blessed with. Culture is the characteristics of a particular <strong>group of people</strong>, defined by everything from language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts. Through culture we are governed by <strong>norms and customs</strong>, which are the pillars of any society. If these pillars are not properly followed in our society, our culture will resemble a perfume with no smell. It’s a gradual existence of presenting those norms and customs to people who surround us through music, dances, arts, crafts, food, dressing style, languages just to mention a few.
</p><p>Culture has been known since man came to an existence and till today we are still practicing it. Through culture we learn how to be better people in the society like living as brothers and sisters. It’s very hard for a person to live without culture because it’s like an antelope at the middle of hungry lioness. A human being is a very complex creature. Every individual human has a distinguished attitude, behaviors as well as traits. It is only through culture where human beings act uniformly and live as a society. Thus, in a simple definition of culture we all agree that culture is a totality way of life of a certain given society as they live and continue to struggle against the nature.  
</p><p>Africa is believed to be the cornerstone of culture and every year, thousands of people from all over the world visit Africa to witness the beautiful culture, history and other amazing natural phenomena which Africa is blessed with and which it cherishes, for instance the earth surface features, wild animals, water bodies as well as hospitality of the people in the continent. Also, food, songs, costumes just to mention a few. Just as we are going to witness in this very day.
</p><p>The way, we Africans handle our lives and whatever surrounds us; that is actually our culture, and it is through which we are identified. However, there are many different cultures from other communities and from other parts of the world, which remain to be the part of great adventure and identity to those people who live in those communities. We also recognize and appreciate their cultures. Wherever you are and wherever you live, your culture is of great value since it is the one which made you to be who you are today. Under no circumstance, a brave should not abandon his or her culture because if one abandons his or her culture, I dare to say he or she would abandon him or herself.
</p><p>It is high time for us to protect all what we have in our culture and whatever is good should be taken to great heights and we should try all our level best to eliminate all those practices which are against human rights even if they have been practiced in our culture for centuries. Practices such as female genital mutilation, discrimination of any kind, torture to women and children and any kind of maltreatment to our society members. Culture is not static, it changes as the human being develops so let us not be prisoners of our own culture.
</p><p>For those who have been here for four years will agree with us that we have been improving always from our first Cultural Day in 2010, 2011 and last year. The event is about commemorating our culture and other cultures beyond our boarders and beyond our continent. It must be well understood that, preserving our culture doesn’t mean to disrespect other peoples’ cultures. Cultures create and develop identities.
</p><p>God bless Africa, God bless Tanzania, and God bless St Jude.
</p><p>Remember, “Jasiri haachi asili,” The brave do not abandon their culture.”
