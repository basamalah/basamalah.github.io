                                            h Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 30) — NEW COVID-19 cases in the country hit another grim record on Monday, with 22,366 infections reported by the Department of Health. This is the first time singlo-day cauen topped 20,000, beating the previous record of 19,441 recorded on Saturday, Aug, 28. It also marked the fourth time this month that the daily count reached an all-time high. The total case tally rose to 1,976,202, of which 148,594 or 7.5% are active cases. Of the currently III , 95.7% exhibit mild symptoms, 1.7% are asymptomatic , 0.97% are moderate cases, 1.1% are severe, and 0.6% are critical. Data from two non-reporting testing laboratories were not part of the count, the DOH noted. The two contribute around 0.1% of samples tested and 0.1% of positive individuals, based on department data over the last two weeks. The death toll also struck 33,330 with 222 more fatalities, including 105 earlier classified as recoveries. This is the thirteenth consecutive day the country saw a triple-digit increase in deaths. Meanwhile, 16,864 were added to the survivor count, which has reached 1,794,278. These mean COVID-19 has killed 1.69% of all confirmed patients nationwide, while 90.8% have gotten well. After final validation, the DOH also sald it deleted 187 duplicates, including 174 recoveries and a death. Its report further showed 65,237 COVID-19 tests were reported on Aug. 28, with 27.5% turning out positive. A positivity rate of above 20% is considered "critical level" and indicates inadequate testing efforts, according to the U.S. nonprofit Covid Act Now. This lack of sufficient testing also suggests that new cases and the infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported, the organization explained. he DOH has earlier warned fresh cases may continue to climb in the following days. On Sunday, it also ported that around 69%, or 516, of the 748 samples in the latest batch of whole genome sequencing were und to be of the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant spite the rising numbers, the independent group OCTA Research said Metro Manila may see a downward nd in infections by mid-September, although it said hospitals will likely continue to deal with a high level of upancy rate. ir Summary:​</a>

The government is promoting another way of greeting another person while ensuring health safety amid the pandemic. House Resolution No. 408 urges the government to promote placing one's palm at the center of the chest together with a slight nod as a customary Filipino gesture of goodwill. This is more commonly known as "Bating Filipino." The resolution was filed by Marikina Rep. Bayani Fernando in July 2019, and was officially adopted last February 2020. This intends to replace the usual handshake to reduce transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, people are being reminded to always practice social distancing since the virus can be passed through droplets coming from an infected person. Fernando told CNN Philippines' News.PH that the new way Filipino greeting shows sincerity and respect towards another person. The representative added that government agencies, specifically the Department of Education, should help in spreading awareness about this. A video has been circulating online that promotes the use of such greeting.

                            4. h Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 30) — NEW COVID-19 cases in the country hit another grim record on Monday, with 22,366 infections reported by the Department of Health. This is the first time singlo-day cauen topped 20,000, beating the previous record of 19,441 recorded on Saturday, Aug, 28. It also marked the fourth time this month that the daily count reached an all-time high. The total case tally rose to 1,976,202, of which 148,594 or 7.5% are active cases. Of the currently III , 95.7% exhibit mild symptoms, 1.7% are asymptomatic , 0.97% are moderate cases, 1.1% are severe, and 0.6% are critical. Data from two non-reporting testing laboratories were not part of the count, the DOH noted. The two contribute around 0.1% of samples tested and 0.1% of positive individuals, based on department data over the last two weeks. The death toll also struck 33,330 with 222 more fatalities, including 105 earlier classified as recoveries. This is the thirteenth consecutive day the country saw a triple-digit increase in deaths.

Its report further showed 65,237 COVID-19 tests were reported on Aug. 28, with 27.5% turning out positive. A positivity rate of above 20% is considered "critical level" and indicates inadequate testing efforts, according to the U.S. nonprofit Covid Act Now. This lack of sufficient testing also suggests that new cases and the infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported, the organization explained. he DOH has earlier warned fresh cases may continue to climb in the following days. On Sunday, it also ported that around 69%, or 516, of the 748 samples in the latest batch of whole genome sequencing were und to be of the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant spite the rising numbers, the independent group OCTA Research said Metro Manila may see a downward nd in infections by mid-September, although it said hospitals will likely continue to deal with a high level of upancy rate. ir Summary:​</h2><br />

The government is promoting another way of greeting another person while ensuring health safety amid the pandemic. House Resolution No. 408 urges the government to promote placing one's palm at the center of the chest together with a slight nod as a customary Filipino gesture of goodwill. This is more commonly known as "Bating Filipino." The resolution was filed by Marikina Rep. Bayani Fernando in July 2019, and was officially adopted last February 2020. This intends to replace the usual handshake to reduce transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, people are being reminded to always practice social distancing since the virus can be passed through droplets coming from an infected person. Fernando told CNN Philippines' News.PH that the new way Filipino greeting shows sincerity and respect towards another person. The representative added that government agencies, specifically the Department of Education, should help in spreading awareness about this. A video has been circulating online that promotes the use of such greeting.
