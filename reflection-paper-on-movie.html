about the films, what did you realize? Which for you is more interesting to do in order to know
or to learn something new? Will you still go for the traditional print based text reading, or will
you go with multimodal texts like listening to audio books (since these types of materials are
available on the internet) or go visual like examining still or moving images just like pictures,
posters and motion pictures or movies? Which is easier for you? Write your reflection on your
paper.
For me, it is easier to learn when ___________________________________________________</a>

My remarkable community quarantine experience It was a couple of months ago when the strictest quarantine was lifted nationwide and the patience of almost every one of us was put into test. Since I had nothing to do, I decided to become productive. I worked a lot of things, specifically my paper works from my full-time job and fixed some of my personal stuff which I was able to enjoy and finish. After those tasks, I spent the rest of my time getting along with my family, we watched numerous movies together which we truly enjoyed. Well, that may be very simple as how it seemned, but for me, it was the most remarkable experience that I had during quarantine because I got an opportunity to become even bonded with my family. Write your own paragraph about your community quarantine experience and tell how the experience became remarkable for you.

                            1. Write your reflection and reaction paper about the movie "Matilda"</h2><br />
                        In the movie Matilda, Matilda's family doesn't see the special gift of wisdom that Matilda has. Except (the teacher). She was kind and gentle. And might just be the perfect mother for Matilda. <p>The first few pages in the book tell about the funny things about parents. First I thought: ”What is here the context with story about Matilda?” But later I understood. These things she tells to the reader will be like a statement. Then the story about Matilda is really the opposite.</p><p>I like the story about Matilda and her family. Matilda has always funny ideas to give them a hard time. But this is their fault. Her parents show no interest in their own children. They are glad, when they can live their own live. So I ask me “Why do they have children?” </p><br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here is a 131 word reflection/reaction paper about the movie The Hail:</p><p></p><p>The 2016 Russian film The Hail (also known as The Stone) left a strong impression on me. The story of three teenagers in a remote Russian village who get caught up in the turmoil and violence of the Chechen war is a stark and sobering depiction of the loss of innocence. The cinematography is stunning, with sweeping shots of the austere Russian countryside juxtaposed with the brutality of war.  </p><p></p><p>More than anything, I was struck by how quickly normal life descends into chaos and cruelty. The main character, Sasha, transforms from a carefree teen focused on girls and skateboarding into a child soldier. The scene where he first kills a man is heartrending. By the end of the film, all three teens have blood on their hands and have grown up too quickly. They emerge profoundly changed, aged well beyond their years. </p><p></p><p>The Hail is not an easy film to watch, but serves as an important reminder of the deep toll that violence and war can take, especially on the young. Although the setting is specific to the Chechen conflict, the story is tragically universal. The loss of innocence and the psychological impacts of war know no borders or native tongues. This film will stay with me as a sobering depiction of how fragile our humanity can be.</p><br />

                            10. So, after reading the story of Mulan in Activity 3 and reading the comparison article
about the films, what did you realize? Which for you is more interesting to do in order to know
or to learn something new? Will you still go for the traditional print based text reading, or will
you go with multimodal texts like listening to audio books (since these types of materials are
available on the internet) or go visual like examining still or moving images just like pictures,
posters and motion pictures or movies? Which is easier for you? Write your reflection on your
paper.
For me, it is easier to learn when ___________________________________________________</h2><br />

My remarkable community quarantine experience It was a couple of months ago when the strictest quarantine was lifted nationwide and the patience of almost every one of us was put into test. Since I had nothing to do, I decided to become productive. I worked a lot of things, specifically my paper works from my full-time job and fixed some of my personal stuff which I was able to enjoy and finish. After those tasks, I spent the rest of my time getting along with my family, we watched numerous movies together which we truly enjoyed. Well, that may be very simple as how it seemned, but for me, it was the most remarkable experience that I had during quarantine because I got an opportunity to become even bonded with my family. Write your own paragraph about your community quarantine experience and tell how the experience became remarkable for you. Criteria in marking the paragraph: Unity - 3 Organization -3 Spelling and Punctuation - 5 Use of Simple Past Tense - 4 Total - 20 (Title) 7​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Hellooo! I worked hard on this and I hope it helps in some way </strong></p><p>     I recently watched the movie "All Hail" and it left me with mixed emotions. The story revolves around a group of teenagers who are forced to survive in a world where technology is no longer accessible, and society has crumbled. While some scenes were intense and gripping, I felt that the overall plot lacked depth and failed to fully captivate my attention.</p><p>     That being said, the acting was commendable and the special effects were impressive. It's clear that the filmmakers put a lot of effort into creating a visually stunning film. However, there were times when the dialogue seemed contrived and unnatural.</p><p>     Overall, while "All Hail" may not be the most compelling post-apocalyptic movie out there, it still had its moments. If you're looking for an action-packed adventure with impressive visuals, then this movie may be worth a watch. But if you're seeking a more thought-provoking and emotionally-driven storyline, you might want to look elsewhere.</p><p><strong>There it is! Have an amazing day :D </strong></p><br />

                        <p>a. It is dramatized. The <strong>Marcoses </strong>are reenacting themselves in the movies as a family who has been wronged by history. The issue with that is how the public will react considering that we have been fed the soap-opera narrative of wealthy families being treated unfairly for decades. The Marcoses identify with that family. The Marcoses are familiar with movies; their late father produced a biography to support his presidency, and the daughter, who is referred to as "darling genius of a girl" in the movie, is aware of what cinema is capable of.</p><p></p><p>b. My feeling was a bit sad about the story line and the happenings about the <strong>Marcos family</strong>.</p><p></p><p>c. It is inappropriate to evaluate <strong>"Maid in Malacanang"</strong> as a doctoral history dissertation because it is only a movie. Our difficulty is distinguishing reality from fiction, history from the director's artistic license or wild speculation. It's ridiculous that Cory Aquino was playing Mahjong with Carmelite nuns when the future of the country was on the line. As I walked out of the cinema, I felt awful for President Marcos Jr. because he had been misrepresented. Who needs enemies when you have an oldest sister like this, the President and his followers might ponder in the wake of this distorted recounting of history.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about the movie Maid in Malacanang, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/30298283</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My writing experience was not bad at all because I  still managed to have good knowledge about  writing. I still remember when we are given only 10 minutes to write an essay/paragraph that consist 200 words. What I did is that I avoid using apostrophe on  my words and I write things again and again in a way that my teacher wouldn't really notice because of the amount of time she had given. I wanted to learn more about writing, to enhance my knowledge about writing because to be honest I have already forgotten some of the lessons we had when I was in highschool. So I'm hoping to learn more and to have more knowledge about writing.</p><p>PS: I'm only Highschool!</p><br />
