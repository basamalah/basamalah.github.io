                        I say that I'm AGAINST it, Why? Because those places are historical and no one can bring it back if they'll destroy it.

                        this is horrible... many years passed that bridges are build / established by many people who suffered from a few people who controlled the government this idea is not applicable to do their plan w/o the concert of a historian .... yes i think it has benefits to every Filipinos but... its just an entertainment for some people.<br />

                        disagree because many farmers like me will suffer in our everyday life and my work job that can affect our food supply and income,and the bridge that has historical value affects everyones history value and transporting our harvest  also crossing,if i was a farmer i will talk to the council and tell what will be the effect on somepeople like me....<br />

                        I would disagree with the idea. The bridge is far too valuable to be demolished like that. It has a significant part in the town's history.<br />

                        <p>Thermal expansion can affect bridges with either expanding or contracting the bridge (or, by essentially distorting it's shape) Expansion joints fill gaps within the bridge and act as a flexible, variable filler that help the bridge adapt to temperature changes without distorting.</p><br />

                        <strong>i would not agree  to the plan of the government which is converting the town rice fields into an industrial park especially if one of the bridges  with historical value will be demolished.</strong><br /><strong> </strong><br /><strong> i am a very historical person and i value the history so as  with the culture and tradition  of my country.</strong><br /><strong> </strong><br /><strong>   just what happen to our mother earth? did you not think the condition of  our mother earth is not his place as us.. :(</strong><br /><strong>  </strong><br /><strong>           </strong><br /><strong>we need to protect our country . coz there's someone who want to kill mother earth .. at kasama tayo dun.. :(</strong><strong>     I DISAGREE.</strong> First let's go with them planning my town's rice fields into an industrial park. I want them to know that I DON'T CARE, and that I don't want it to be converted into a trivial industrial park. Well, they can convert other towns' rice fields but NOT MINE. I want my town to be true, to be special and to be original. I don't care if what's in there is just a plain, boring rice field because what matters in here and for me is the fact that it is unique. I don't care even if the towns founded in the whole wide world are all converted into industrial parks, malls, or whatsoever because I just want mine to be something peculiar and special. I want mine to be something that the whole humanity will going to look forward to. I want them to appreciate the beauty of being monotonous or being a mediocre. I want them to realize that even a plain and a jejune ricefield can be an ideal place that they can go to sometimes. If the rest of the world's town's rice fields are converted into malls and buildings, mine will something that will stand out. I don't want to conform with them, I just want mine that will look different with everything. Eventually, people will going to be tired with the cliche world they're living (the buildings, malls and whatsoever) so basically, they will going to ascertain a place something distinctive and that would be my ricefield. I want the next generations to see the value of history.<br /><br />      One of the bridges with a historical value being demolished?? THAT'S SO LAME FOR GOD'S SAKE. That's a cheap move, I swear. So cheap. Why not appreciate its value? Why not give significance with the things it has done to us and to our world? I love history and as a historian, I want the society to learn and to appreciate history. One day, the next generations will going to stand with awe about this bridge and I want that to happen. It's important and it's necessary for people to learn what happened in the past, because they have the right to do so. They are curious what, how, why, when?..?? Then this bridge will be the answer. <strong>History will be the answer.<br /><br />--<br />﻿<br />﻿</strong>﻿--﻿Have a buoyant Saturday﻿--<br /><br />

                        No, because the next generations future will be affected. They will not see the historical places anymore and they might have less food because other people are trying to make fields for planting to modern facilities, etc. ^_^v<br />

                        Vendor: As an ordinary people, I know the feeling of having a rice field converted into an industrial park. I know how the farmers would grieve for that plan because that rice field is their source of income. And about the bridge I also disagree in demolishing that because I know that the value of a thing increases as the time passes by. And nothing could replace, even money, that bridge with historical value.<br />

                        For me, the answer is no. If we lose our rice field then our rice production would decrease, although we have a benefit of having a town park, we still need physiological needs than anything else like industrial parks. Also, we can't demolish historical bridges with historical value. Yes we could restore them, but if we could demolish then that place won't be historical anymore and as a result children would have a lesser knowledge about this specific knowledge.<br /><br />Hope this helps ^-^<br />
