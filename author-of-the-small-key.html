The ability to identify the main idea in text is a key in reading comprehension skills. Similarly, it also helps in remembering text, to understand the purpose of the author and to determine the importance and meanings of the entire texts. After going through this lesson, you are expected to: 1. Identify the main idea, key sentence and supporting details from the text 2. Note details in an informational text Every story, passage or paragraph has a main idea, key sentence and supporting details. called the big idea and the most important thought about the topic. The topic The main idea tells what the story, poem or paragraph is all about. It is also the person, thing or idea about. A key sentence is the sentence directly stated from the paragraph that expresses the main idea or topic of the paragraph, story or poem. It can be found at the beginning, middle or last sentence of the paragraph. But generally. appears at the beginning of the paragraph. It is often the paragraph's very f sentence. important details that explain, prove and describe the main idea for be Supporting details or small ideas tell more about the main idea.

Also, the extent of the effect may be dampened by the level of capability of teachers to use digital learning tools and resources effectively to achieve learning outcomes. More effective use of digital teaching to raise attainment includes the ability of teachers to identify how digital tools and resources can be used to achieve learning outcomes and adapting their approach, as well as having knowledge and understanding of the technology. This applies in all schools.Where learners use digital learning at home as well as school for formal and non-formal learning activities these have positive effects on their attainment, because they have extended their learning time. This is particularly important for secondary age learners.The assessment framework, set out in Annex 2, identifies a number of educational benefits that digital learning and teaching has the potential to help learners aged 5 to 18 to realise, through the opportunity to learn in different ways, access more sources of information, and be tested and get feedback differently. In terms of raising attainment, these benefits include short term outcomes, such as having a greater feeling of control over learning and more confidence to practise a skill, through to medium term outcomes such as faster acquisition of knowledge and skills, and improved impacts in terms of learners achieving higher exam or test results where digital technology has been used.In this section, the impact of digital technology on children's attainment in a range of areas is discussed, followed by the impact on aspects of numeracy, literacy and science learning.Raising children's attainmentThere is a substantial body of research that has examined the impact of digital tools and resources on children's attainment in a range of areas.Higgins et al (2012) provide a summary of research findings from studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which have been combined in meta-analyses to assess the impact of digital learning in schools. Their search identified 48 studies which synthesised empirical research of the impact of digital tools and resources on the attainment of school age learners (5-18 year olds).They found consistent but small positive associations between digital learning and educational outcomes. For example, Harrison et al (2004) identified statistically significant findings, positively associating higher levels of ICT use with school achievement at each Key Stage in England, and in English, maths, science, modern foreign languages and design technology. Somekh et al (2007) identified a link between high levels of ICT use and improved school performance. They found that the rate of improvement in tests in English at the end of primary education was faster in ICT Test Bed education authorities in England than in equivalent comparator areas. However, Higgins et al note that while these associations show, on average, schools with higher than average levels of ICT provision also have learners who perform slightly higher than average, it may be the case that high performing schools are more likely to be better equipped or more prepared to invest in technology or more motivated to bring about improvement.Higgins et al report that in general analyses of the impact of digital technology on learning, the typical overall effect size is between 0.3 and 0.4 - just slightly below the overall average for researched interventions in education (Sipe &amp; Curlette, 1997; Hattie, 2008) and no greater than other researched changes to teaching to raise attainment, such as peer tutoring or more focused feedback to learners. The range of effect sizes is also very wide (-0.03 to 1.05),which suggests that it is essential to take into account the differences between technologies and how they are used.​</a>

The nation is subsisting on a diet of high-calorie convenience food in fact, Americans have increased their spending on fast-food items from $6 billion to nearly $160 billion annually over the past four decades. What may come as a shock. however, is the accumulation of evidence suggesting that the inain ingredients in the typical "hamburger, fries, and a cola are addictive compounds that their fix. lining keep next for customers up (2) The key culprits are sugar and far. Empirical studies reveal that the heavy dosage of these substances in today's super-sized standard of a fast-food meal can trigger brain activity similar to that endured when a person is on hard drugs. A representative individual serving at McDonald's or Burger King can dish out up to 2000 calories, including more than a cup of sugar and 84 grams of fat. Single-handedly. this meal sized portion meets the full daily caloric requirement for the average woman. Moreover, it exceeds the recommended daily allowances of both sugar and fat for any adult, regardless of gender (3) Whercas heroin opiate, both sugar and fat stimulate endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphins in the hypothalamus. just above the brain stem. These naturally oecumng painkillers activate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, into a small cluster of cells located in the midbrain called the nucleus acumens. Here. dopamine functions to elicit feelings of pleasure or euphoria. What's more. it motivates an individual to proactively repeat any action that onginally fucled its production. In the case of sugar and fat, purported addiction is a consequence of the body raving the release of dopamine inherent in consumption (4) To validate reports that fat and sugar bchavc in A drug-like fashion researchers have conducted laboratory studios demonstrating that they induce classic addictive symptoms. For example, eliminating sugar from the nutritiona regime of rats that are used to a primarily sweet diet produced anxiety asymptomatic of heroin and nicotine withdrawal. Moreover, increased tolerance to addictive food substances was noted. In one experiment, rates were fed chocolate drink containing a high ratio of both fat and sugar. Although the animals were found to ingest increasing amounts of the potent liquid, their tota production of resulting brain opiates was, in fact, diminished. This would sugges that the rodents had become progressively more tolerant to the effects of fnt ang in order achieve sugar.

But how could that simple shading in your ballot be so important? According to Republic Act No. 8189 known as the Voter’s Registration Act pf 1996, Section 9, all citizens of the Philippines not otherwise disqualified by law who are at least 18 years of age, who shall have resided in the Philippines for at least one year and in place wherein they propose to vote for at least six months immediately preceding the election, may register as a voter. In the next two years, these youth will be the registered voters who will be the key to change what the people are currently experiencing into something better. Recently, we heard news about how people in the government abuse their power of authority like what happened in a slay video which shows how a cop shot a mother and her son mercilessly in front of the cop’s daughter and the victim’s family. Corruption in the national government is also evident like the alleged anomalies in the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth). These issues in the government must serve as our eye opener to use our right to vote in a much responsible way.         We should be more educated and aware on how to vote wisely in elections in order to save our country from abusive leaders. We should know the importance of one vote. Let’s be aware and careful on how the people we elected turn to be the exact opposite of what they have promised during the campaign. We should use our right to vote wisely because as we vote, we are giving our trust to the future leaders of the country. We should advocate responsible voting by expressing our opinions and encouraging others on not to engage in illegal acts like vote buying because vote buying is similar to buying their rights as citizens. Let us persuade them not to be deceived by the good sides that candidates put up during campaign period. We should capitalize on the current state of our government and country and let it be the basis for the significant improvements we all hope for. It’s better to be governed by a leader who is responsible and trustworthy than a candidate who only knows how to sugar-coat words and make false promises.Let us agree that voting may look like a small thing, but it is the voice we all have. It is a right that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Voting will help people express their voices and it will be heard through shading in ballots. Voting is part of your democracy, your freedom as a citizen which we should not fail to exercise.If you think that one vote in a sea of millions cannot make a change, think about how raindrops can make floods. It may be a small thing, but it can change course of this game called live. Let your vote count be the game changer.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is about a woman named Soledad who is married to a man named Pedro Buhay. They live on a farm. One morning Soledad finds herself knowing that the farm will produce plenty but that she still had some inner feeling of discontent. She planned to mend some of her husband's shirts, which were in a locked trunk. Pedro took out from his pocket a string which held two keys, one large and shiny and one small and rusty. He gave Soledad the large key to his trunk and put the small key back in his jacket pocket. Since it was hot that morning, he removed his coat before leaving to work in the field. When he was gone, Soledad began to fold the jacket and the small key fell to the floor. It is obvious that Pedro values the small key while Soledad fears it.</p><p></p><p>Soledad knows that the small key is a key to a different trunk. She tries to busy herself so that she will not think about what the smaller trunk contains, but she cannot stop thinking about it and reveals that the small trunk contains clothing that belonged to Pedro's first wife. She wonders why it is that he keeps her old clothing and why he seems to have a special feeling about them. She obviously fears that Pedro still loves his first wife even though she has been dead for many years by now. She reveals that she hates the things in the small trunk and worries that they will destroy the relationship between her and her husband. Despite her attempts to not think about the contents of the small trunk, Soledad opens it. At this point, Pedro returns home to find Soledad in bed supposedly with a fever. It turns out she does not. The next morning Pedro discovers a pile of ashes and half burnt clothing in the backyard. He realizes what Soledad has done and rushes to look in the trunk to confirm it. Soledad has indeed, burned his first wife's clothing.</p><p></p><p>Pedro is angry and bitter that this has happened and he expects that Soleda will explain things later. He thinks to himself that he will forgive her because he loves her but that even if she did it out of love for him, it will always remain a matter of some resentment toward her for doing it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope is helps</p><br />

Also, the extent of the effect may be dampened by the level of capability of teachers to use digital learning tools and resources effectively to achieve learning outcomes. More effective use of digital teaching to raise attainment includes the ability of teachers to identify how digital tools and resources can be used to achieve learning outcomes and adapting their approach, as well as having knowledge and understanding of the technology. This applies in all schools.Where learners use digital learning at home as well as school for formal and non-formal learning activities these have positive effects on their attainment, because they have extended their learning time. This is particularly important for secondary age learners.The assessment framework, set out in Annex 2, identifies a number of educational benefits that digital learning and teaching has the potential to help learners aged 5 to 18 to realise, through the opportunity to learn in different ways, access more sources of information, and be tested and get feedback differently. In terms of raising attainment, these benefits include short term outcomes, such as having a greater feeling of control over learning and more confidence to practise a skill, through to medium term outcomes such as faster acquisition of knowledge and skills, and improved impacts in terms of learners achieving higher exam or test results where digital technology has been used.In this section, the impact of digital technology on children's attainment in a range of areas is discussed, followed by the impact on aspects of numeracy, literacy and science learning.Raising children's attainmentThere is a substantial body of research that has examined the impact of digital tools and resources on children's attainment in a range of areas.Higgins et al (2012) provide a summary of research findings from studies with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which have been combined in meta-analyses to assess the impact of digital learning in schools. Their search identified 48 studies which synthesised empirical research of the impact of digital tools and resources on the attainment of school age learners (5-18 year olds).They found consistent but small positive associations between digital learning and educational outcomes. For example, Harrison et al (2004) identified statistically significant findings, positively associating higher levels of ICT use with school achievement at each Key Stage in England, and in English, maths, science, modern foreign languages and design technology. Somekh et al (2007) identified a link between high levels of ICT use and improved school performance. They found that the rate of improvement in tests in English at the end of primary education was faster in ICT Test Bed education authorities in England than in equivalent comparator areas. However, Higgins et al note that while these associations show, on average, schools with higher than average levels of ICT provision also have learners who perform slightly higher than average, it may be the case that high performing schools are more likely to be better equipped or more prepared to invest in technology or more motivated to bring about improvement.Higgins et al report that in general analyses of the impact of digital technology on learning, the typical overall effect size is between 0.3 and 0.4 - just slightly below the overall average for researched interventions in education (Sipe &amp; Curlette, 1997; Hattie, 2008) and no greater than other researched changes to teaching to raise attainment, such as peer tutoring or more focused feedback to learners. The range of effect sizes is also very wide (-0.03 to 1.05),which suggests that it is essential to take into account the differences between technologies and how they are used.​</h2><br />

Read the report below then do the tasks that follow                      Fast-food Addiction 1 it is no secret that the US is leading the world in its swelling obesity. The nation is subsisting on a diet of high-calorie convenience food in fact, Americans have increased their spending on fast-food items from $6 billion to nearly $160 billion annually over the past four decades. What may come as a shock. however, is the accumulation of evidence suggesting that the inain ingredients in the typical "hamburger, fries, and a cola are addictive compounds that their fix. lining keep next for customers up (2) The key culprits are sugar and far. Empirical studies reveal that the heavy dosage of these substances in today's super-sized standard of a fast-food meal can trigger brain activity similar to that endured when a person is on hard drugs. A representative individual serving at McDonald's or Burger King can dish out up to 2000 calories, including more than a cup of sugar and 84 grams of fat. Single-handedly. this meal sized portion meets the full daily caloric requirement for the average woman. Moreover, it exceeds the recommended daily allowances of both sugar and fat for any adult, regardless of gender (3) Whercas heroin opiate, both sugar and fat stimulate endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphins in the hypothalamus. just above the brain stem. These naturally oecumng painkillers activate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, into a small cluster of cells located in the midbrain called the nucleus acumens.

But how could that simple shading in your ballot be so important? According to Republic Act No. 8189 known as the Voter’s Registration Act pf 1996, Section 9, all citizens of the Philippines not otherwise disqualified by law who are at least 18 years of age, who shall have resided in the Philippines for at least one year and in place wherein they propose to vote for at least six months immediately preceding the election, may register as a voter. In the next two years, these youth will be the registered voters who will be the key to change what the people are currently experiencing into something better.

Corruption in the national government is also evident like the alleged anomalies in the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth). These issues in the government must serve as our eye opener to use our right to vote in a much responsible way.         We should be more educated and aware on how to vote wisely in elections in order to save our country from abusive leaders. We should know the importance of one vote. Let’s be aware and careful on how the people we elected turn to be the exact opposite of what they have promised during the campaign. We should use our right to vote wisely because as we vote, we are giving our trust to the future leaders of the country. We should advocate responsible voting by expressing our opinions and encouraging others on not to engage in illegal acts like vote buying because vote buying is similar to buying their rights as citizens. Let us persuade them not to be deceived by the good sides that candidates put up during campaign period. We should capitalize on the current state of our government and country and let it be the basis for the significant improvements we all hope for. It’s better to be governed by a leader who is responsible and trustworthy than a candidate who only knows how to sugar-coat words and make false promises.Let us agree that voting may look like a small thing, but it is the voice we all have. It is a right that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Voting will help people express their voices and it will be heard through shading in ballots.
