                                            ACTIVITY #2. Identify in which section of the research paper each of these extracts is likely to appear and write it beside the extract. Use the 12 section names that were referred to in ACTIVITY#1. You don't need to try to understand the exact content of each extract. Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</a>

                                            here are three types of truth. The first is seeking truth in the arts. The
creative artist tries to explore beneath the surface of things so as to obtain a more
in-depth understanding of human experience. The expressiveness of the artist.
However, it takes on different forms. Forms inherent to the arts. The artist seeks
truth not in rational argumentation, but rather through his perception, his
imagination, his institutions and even emotions.
The second type of truth is scientific truth. Just like the philosopher and the
artist the scientist is engaged in truth seeking activities. He makes discoveries
about the world; and he tries to make rational sense and coherent explanations of
his observations. He conducts physical experiments and often making use of
mathematical formulas either to verify or negate his starting assumptions.
Eventually he draws conclusions concurring to the results of his experiments. That
is how the scientist defines truth.
The third type of truth is, of course, philosophical truth. Here, reason and
reasoning pervades. To arrive at philosophical truths, inquiry is absolutely
required. Philosophers delve into and scrutinize cases involving human affairs and
conduct. They ask fundamental questions pertaining to such cases. They disagree
and argue amongst themselves on the merits of these cases. Such is the procedure
in trying to ascertain philosophical truths. Such is he establishing of the Socratic
method the first great critical method.

                                            PERFORMANCE TASK 1: Read the article below and answer the following questions. Health Benefits of Origami This article was written and shared in the Origami-List by Larry Wood Can the folding of paper or the practice of Origami be of benefit to our health? Yes, the practice of Origami can be beneficial to our health. A recent AARP (American Association of Retired People) article entitled, “Boost Your Brain Health” discussed things we can do to keep our brain healthy as we age. Tasks that challenge our mind, building on innate talents and abilities through a variety of mentally challenging tasks, strengthen our brain. Origami is one avenue that provides both mental and physical stimulus with exercise. Origami helps develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and mental concentration. Use of the hands directly stimulates areas of the brain. Origami is used in various therapeutic settings, including art therapy and in stroke and injury rehabilitation. Paper folding challenges us at the cognitive level as we follow instructions, learning new skills and activities. Physically our hands become active. Impulses are sent to the brain activating both left and right hemispheres of the brain. Tactile, motor and visual areas of the brain are activated and brought into use. Memory, non-verbal thinking, attention, 3D comprehension and imagination are further stimulated by the brain's exploration of Origami. Emotional satisfaction is a byproduct of our work as we watch a piece of paper transformed into a new creation. Many find the folding of paper, a form of relaxation. In addition, grandchildren are often fascinated when we share our skills and creations with them. source: https://www.origamispirit.com/2011/01/health-benefits-of-origami Answer the following questions.

Just look for clues that help you find the answer.1.As youths look for sources of information, emotional understanding and cues for the expression of their emerging social and personal identity, they often find music to provide them with valuable meanings (Zillman and Gan, 1987). 2. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of teen pop lyrics and their significance at the personal and sociocultural level.3.In our analysis, we included all the artists featured on the Disney Channel Network (hereafter, DCN) during the third week of December 2000 in order to draw a broad sample of contemporary teen pop performers. We chose the DCN because it is one of only two TV cable channels whose programming is dedicated TIV exclusively to pre-adolescents and adolescents. Whereas the label 'rock' has often been used as an umbrella term to catch just about any genre other than classical, one particular style that has been largely ignored by academic observers is teen pop. The influence of teen pop in pre-adolescent and adolescent.4.culture can no longer be ignored given its increasingly dominant role in music sales, TV and radio airplay, the proliferation of popular female performers and all-boy bands, and the integration of individual teen pop stars into advertising campaigns by Fortune 500 corporations (e.g., Burger King, McDonald's, PepsiCo, Inc.).5. While reading these lyrics, we encountered numerous stories of obsessive thinking, potent feelings of attachment, and mentions of much emotional and physical support received and offered through care and sex that seem to guarantee these lovers vital stimulation and freedom. In short, dependence on love seems to be a form of perceived self-insufficiency, a feeling that one cannot bear one's existence by oneself. Teen pop music writers and performers narrate vividly the details of these feelings of insufficiency.​pasagot po thanks</h2><br />

                            10. here are three types of truth. The first is seeking truth in the arts. The
creative artist tries to explore beneath the surface of things so as to obtain a more
in-depth understanding of human experience. The expressiveness of the artist.
However, it takes on different forms. Forms inherent to the arts. The artist seeks
truth not in rational argumentation, but rather through his perception, his
imagination, his institutions and even emotions.
The second type of truth is scientific truth. Just like the philosopher and the
artist the scientist is engaged in truth seeking activities. He makes discoveries
about the world; and he tries to make rational sense and coherent explanations of
his observations. He conducts physical experiments and often making use of
mathematical formulas either to verify or negate his starting assumptions.
Eventually he draws conclusions concurring to the results of his experiments. That
is how the scientist defines truth.
The third type of truth is, of course, philosophical truth. Here, reason and
reasoning pervades. To arrive at philosophical truths, inquiry is absolutely
required. Philosophers delve into and scrutinize cases involving human affairs and
conduct. They ask fundamental questions pertaining to such cases. They disagree
and argue amongst themselves on the merits of these cases. Such is the procedure
in trying to ascertain philosophical truths. Such is he establishing of the Socratic
method the first great critical method.

                            24. PERFORMANCE TASK 1: Read the article below and answer the following questions. Health Benefits of Origami This article was written and shared in the Origami-List by Larry Wood Can the folding of paper or the practice of Origami be of benefit to our health? Yes, the practice of Origami can be beneficial to our health. A recent AARP (American Association of Retired People) article entitled, “Boost Your Brain Health” discussed things we can do to keep our brain healthy as we age. Tasks that challenge our mind, building on innate talents and abilities through a variety of mentally challenging tasks, strengthen our brain. Origami is one avenue that provides both mental and physical stimulus with exercise. Origami helps develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and mental concentration. Use of the hands directly stimulates areas of the brain. Origami is used in various therapeutic settings, including art therapy and in stroke and injury rehabilitation. Paper folding challenges us at the cognitive level as we follow instructions, learning new skills and activities. Physically our hands become active. Impulses are sent to the brain activating both left and right hemispheres of the brain. Tactile, motor and visual areas of the brain are activated and brought into use. Memory, non-verbal thinking, attention, 3D comprehension and imagination are further stimulated by the brain's exploration of Origami. Emotional satisfaction is a byproduct of our work as we watch a piece of paper transformed into a new creation. Many find the folding of paper, a form of relaxation. In addition, grandchildren are often fascinated when we share our skills and creations with them. source: https://www.origamispirit.com/2011/01/health-benefits-of-origami Answer the following questions.
