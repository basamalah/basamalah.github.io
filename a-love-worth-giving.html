"Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle challenged government leaders involved in the anomalies to undergo conversion and renewal. “There is corruption everywhere. If proven, there should be conversion from those who committed it,” Tagle said over Radio Veritas. The cardinal earlier said that the pork barrel scam was a form of injustice, saying that “instead of giving what is due to others and to the country, resources are being denied from them.” “We do not only lack love for others but we also lack a sense of justice,” he said during Caritas Manila’s Generosity Conference on Sunday. Tagle called on Filipinos to turn their back from greed by “letting the values of fairness and generosity reign in their lives.” He urged the faithful to be sensitive to the needs of the less fortunate."</a>

She says I must love to argue because I go looking for arguments, but I don't. I just want her to love me. She loves my brother who is older. Every time we argue she brings him up and tell me she never had this trouble with him. It's so annoying. She doesn't understand I'm not my brother. I love her so much and I just want her to see that. I want us to get along like other mothers and daughters. Fights With Mum​</a>

                                            Is there any love that is nobler
Purer and more sublime
Than the love of the native country?
What love is? Certainly none.
Though the mind may not cease reflecting
And sifting with perseverance
What humanity has printed and written:
That will be the result, none other.
Sacred love! when thou reignest
In a loyal heart, be it even
A plebeian's, a rustic's untutored
Thou makest it grand and revered.
To give the fatherland boundless honor
Is the purpose of all who are worthy
And who sing, or compose, or make verses
To spread their country's glory.
There is nothing worth having the patriot
Will not give for his native land:
Blood and wealth, and knowledge and effort,
Even life, to be crushed and taken.
Why? What thing of infinite greatness
Is this, that all knees should be bended
Before it? that it should be held higher
Than the things most precious, even life?</a>

                                            ctivity 7 A simple paragraph is composed of three basic parts: a topic sentence (provides the focus), supporting details (explains the information) and concluding sentence (provides the summary). Directions: Copy and do the following in your notebook: Underline the topic sentence Box the supporting sentences, •Circle the closing/concluding sentence. 1. There are many reasons why a cat makes a great pet. First, a cat is always happy to see you when you get home. Second, they will love you unconditionally, which is a really nice thing when you are having a bad day Cats don't require regular grooming. They are easy to take care of on a regular basis. All they need is to be loved, fed and play with. They love to purr near hands and feet, they are easy to train. They are great pets that the love and care you give them are worth what they give you in return. 2. Not taking proper care of your teeth can lead to many unhealthy and unappealing consequences. If you do not properly brush your teeth and floss daily, bacteria builds up around the gum line and between your teeth. This leads to decay or cavities. These bacteria can also lead to gum disease. If you do not get proper attention to your teeth and let the decay and gum disease continue, your teeth will eventually rot and have to be removed. The rotting teeth and gum disease will cause you to have bad breath, as well as unappealing smile; and worse, dental bacteria leads to heart disease. Taking care of your teeth is not only for you to have a beautiful smile but it is important to your health.

                                            1. Read the provided essay.
2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

Also, give the paragraph a catchy title. Both children and adults love to celebrate the Holiday season. Childrendo not go to school. Adults get a few days off from work. Children love to sing lively songs. Adults listen to the children when they sing. Children receive cool gifts from children’s parents, friends, and they also receive presents from other relatives. The children also give the people simple yet nice presents. Receiving gifts make adults happy, too. Adults receive more money during holiday season. They receive holiday bonuses. Adults are more capable to buy gifts for the people they love. They can even give the special people in their lives fancy gifts even if they don’t really have to give fancy gifts. Holiday season is a great season. People show love. People show kindness. People show generosity. Enemies, young and old, become friends. It’s a wonderfulcelebration. It is worth celebrating.​</a>

                                            praise to my seven love sja My first love is my mother sweet, I am blessed with her sweet caress. She carries me in grace and despise me less. Her embrace and kiss holds me in peace, And it sure puts me in a perfect place. Second love comes the golden sun, His heat and fury brings fun. And a minute of his absence, everyone is gone, Yet his fiery loadth makes you run. In a chilling and soaking lan. Third love is the water clear. An element of life and bear, At times of plague and draught should he be near. For we will vanish unaware. Yet in his moist and humid state you'll find a life well taken care. A breathe of air is the fourth, For in its absence life ain't worth. Thus as he blow we go forth. To the south, the east, the west and even north. Yes he's the reason for someone's birth. The fifth is the pastured land, A gift from heavens entrust in hand. Where the green fields stood and stand, And people celebrate with band, Giving a life galore and grand. My sixth love is you, Not a lady nor a beau, Yet could love without ado And could trap a raging bow. Because that's what brothers do. My seventh love is our Almighty God, For without thee these things won't bud, Although He's last on list that's odd, Yet this latter makes Him the most important lad. A perfect embodiment of my long lost dad.PAGAWA PO CRITIQUE ABOUT DYAN PLEASE NEED KONA BUKAS DIAKO MAKAKA TAKE NG EXAM PAG WALA AKONG PROJECT ​</a>

Instead we become more and more close to each other and we receive more and more blessings from God. That's why it is worth. It is because the real love that we all have to each other. And also we find real love to God and it is so worth it that we face our challenges in our life with the Lord by our side.</p><br />

"Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle challenged government leaders involved in the anomalies to undergo conversion and renewal. “There is corruption everywhere. If proven, there should be conversion from those who committed it,” Tagle said over Radio Veritas. The cardinal earlier said that the pork barrel scam was a form of injustice, saying that “instead of giving what is due to others and to the country, resources are being denied from them.” “We do not only lack love for others but we also lack a sense of justice,” he said during Caritas Manila’s Generosity Conference on Sunday. Tagle called on Filipinos to turn their back from greed by “letting the values of fairness and generosity reign in their lives.” He urged the faithful to be sensitive to the needs of the less fortunate."</h2><br />

These emotions and feelings help establish a certain atmosphere or mood. The writer of the poem creates the mood using a number of elements such as setting, tone and theme. To define the mood of a poem, the reader should analyze how these different elements interact and what feeling or atmosphere they evoke.</p><br />

                            10. Is there any love that is nobler
Purer and more sublime
Than the love of the native country?
What love is? Certainly none.
Though the mind may not cease reflecting
And sifting with perseverance
What humanity has printed and written:
That will be the result, none other.
Sacred love! when thou reignest
In a loyal heart, be it even
A plebeian's, a rustic's untutored
Thou makest it grand and revered.
To give the fatherland boundless honor
Is the purpose of all who are worthy
And who sing, or compose, or make verses
To spread their country's glory.
There is nothing worth having the patriot
Will not give for his native land:
Blood and wealth, and knowledge and effort,

                            15. 1. Read the provided essay.
2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />

The children also give the people simple yet nice presents. Receiving gifts make adults happy, too. Adults receive more money during holiday season. They receive holiday bonuses. Adults are more capable to buy gifts for the people they love. They can even give the special people in their lives fancy gifts even if they don’t really have to give fancy gifts. Holiday season is a great season. People show love. People show kindness. People show generosity. Enemies, young and old, become friends. It’s a wonderfulcelebration.

Her embrace and kiss holds me in peace, And it sure puts me in a perfect place. Second love comes the golden sun, His heat and fury brings fun. And a minute of his absence, everyone is gone, Yet his fiery loadth makes you run. In a chilling and soaking lan. Third love is the water clear. An element of life and bear, At times of plague and draught should he be near. For we will vanish unaware. Yet in his moist and humid state you'll find a life well taken care. A breathe of air is the fourth, For in its absence life ain't worth. Thus as he blow we go forth. To the south, the east, the west and even north. Yes he's the reason for someone's birth. The fifth is the pastured land, A gift from heavens entrust in hand. Where the green fields stood and stand, And people celebrate with band, Giving a life galore and grand. My sixth love is you, Not a lady nor a beau, Yet could love without ado And could trap a raging bow. Because that's what brothers do. My seventh love is our Almighty God, For without thee these things won't bud, Although He's last on list that's odd, Yet this latter makes Him the most important lad.
