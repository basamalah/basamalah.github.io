                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>n school, students indeed experience bullying. May it be offensive words of one's physicality, misunderstanding of words or body language, misjudged, etc.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are three things to consider in a situation of a bully and the victim. We must not forget also the bystander. In my opinion, it is the worst of them all. Why? Because a bystander in a situation like this doesn't care at all, a bystander doesn't care if you're bullied or not. A bystander who doesn't report to the principal's office or stand up for the victim. This type does apply to many, which makes us look like hypocrites. Why hypocrites? Because we're similar to what the bully is doing to the victim. As a matter of fact, not everyone is going to be the bully intentionally but not everyone is going to be the victim. Life is full of choices, you either choose what you're going to do because it's your life. What you do today will affect someone's life, may it be good or bad. What you don't do today will not affect you but you will lose something.
</p><p>
</p><p>How to avoid being a bystander, a bully and a victim of bullying? First, you need to respect yourself first. Why? Because if you know how to respect yourself, you will also know how to respect others. Second, you need to accept people's corrections without lashing out. Lastly, love God before loving yourself, because God is the whole definition of love.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>nabasa ko lng po</p><br />

                            7. Essay about cause and effect about cyber bullying</h2><br />
                        <strong></strong>Most people know that bullying is wrong. Calling someone names has absolutely no beneficial purpose. Moreover, hitting someone makes a bully feel good in the moment while doing permanent damage to the person being victimized. With the Internet, people now have even more opportunities to bully through cyberbullying. This includes sending crude pictures, posting fake web pages, or tweeting slanderous messages. Cyberbullying has subsequently led to a rise in a completely new kind of bullying.<p>One of the effects of bullying is that it can change the victim’s personality. It can cause people who are normally confident and happy to become self-conscious, shy, and unsure. Additionally, victims of bullying may also become sad or depressed. Their confidence might completely disappear, keeping them from trying new things or trusting people. Once a person has been bullied, they may hesitate to participate in situations where he or she might be ridiculed, such as in public speaking or in sports. A bullying victim might even begin to possess previously absent anxious<br />behavior.</p><p>Despite all the negative effects of bullying, there are even far more serious consequences. People who have been bullied sometimes become so upset, scared, or depressed that they see no worth in themselves and no way out of their torment. There have been countless reports over the past few years of students committing suicide because they were bullied. Meanwhile, there are times when victims see no recourse but to seek revenge by serious acts of violence against the bully and instigators. As a result of bullying, people can lose their ability to love and trust, denying them the chance to experience a quality relationship later in their life. They might find themselves as a submissive partner or they may want to be completely alone. Compounding all of these problems, victims often develop eating disorders, begin to self-injure, or require extensive counseling. Social bullying can also leave people without a supportive group of friends that they can lean on and spend time with.</p><p>Another unfortunate consequence of this is that bullying is often cyclical. People who have been bullied can, in an attempt to gain their power and self-esteem back, become bullies themselves. In relation to this, bullies who are not confronted or stopped may find themselves in future positions where they can bully as adults. This is where manipulative bosses and child abusers come from.</p><p>Aside from its long-term effects, some consequences of bullying can be seen and felt immediately. When one child calls another child names, the victim might cry and a bruise might appear after a punch to the arm. However, some effects of bullying are not always obvious to the naked eye. The results of bullying might grow and appear over time, damaging a person in profound ways for the long term. There are so many effects of bullying that they are impossible to count or predict. This is why it is so important to stop bullying.</p><br />

                        <p>Typed this one for ya 'lad </p><p></p><p></p><p>   Cyberbullying is a form of harassment that occurs online or through electronic devices such as smartphones, computers, and tablets. This type of bullying can have a profound negative impact on the lives of young people, and it is important to take steps to control it to prevent any further harm. While some may argue that cyberbullying is simply a part of modern life and that children should just toughen up, it is essential to acknowledge the severity of the issue and work to prevent it from happening in the first place.</p><p></p><p>   One of the most significant concerns about cyberbullying is the impact it has on young people's mental health. Constant harassment and humiliation can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Cyberbullying can also lead to physical harm, including self-harm and suicide. The rise in cyberbullying-related incidents over the years is a clear indication that this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p></p><p>   Some may argue that cyberbullying is just a part of growing up, and children need to learn to deal with it. However, this is not a valid argument. Bullying of any kind should never be accepted, and we should work to prevent it from happening altogether. Children should not be subjected to the pain and suffering that comes with cyberbullying, and it is our responsibility to protect them.</p><p></p><p>   The issue of cyberbullying can also have a ripple effect on the community. Children who are bullied may become bullies themselves, perpetuating the cycle of harassment and humiliation. This can create a negative environment, where children are afraid to speak out and seek help.</p><p></p><p>   One way to prevent cyberbullying is to regulate online behavior. Parents, teachers, and other adults should monitor online activity and take action when necessary. Schools and organizations should also provide education on the dangers of cyberbullying and how to prevent it. We must create a culture where bullying of any kind is unacceptable, and there are severe consequences for those who engage in it.</p><p></p><p>   In conclusion, cyberbullying is a serious issue that needs to be controlled to prevent a negative influence on youth. The impact of cyberbullying can be devastating, and it is our responsibility to protect our children from harm. While some may argue that cyberbullying is just a part of modern life, we must work to prevent it from happening and create a safe and positive environment for our youth. By taking action and regulating online behavior, we can make a difference and create a better future for our children.</p><br />

The expectations of most parents of the school, is protection. Meanwhile, many staff feel unprepared and unwilling to be prosecutors and judges because they do not want to be sued for something done which might seem right to them but not to others, especially to parents who are responsible for the child's well being.<br />             Students and teachers should always have conversations about relationships on a daily basis. Although teachers can't preach kindness to students; but they can teach students how to be nice and kind to one another. Teachers needs to structure learning activities in which children can learn to view individual differences as unique sources of strength. For example, a lawsuit was filed against a high school about bullying in upstate New York; a gay teenager sued the Mohawk Central School District, saying school officials had not protected him. "The district said it would increase staff training to prevent harassment" (Eckholm and Katie 3). It is very important that every student, not just the few that sign up for special projects or after school activities, but students who are involved in any various activities in school should attend meetings about teaching students how to respect each other. This will help teachers prevent cyber-bullying in school by drawing students together. People have to understand that some children bully because they have emotional and developmental problems, or because they come from abusive families. <br />
