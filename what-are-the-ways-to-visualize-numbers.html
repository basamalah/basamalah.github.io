                                            How can distance be determined? It can be determined through describing it by means of visuals. Also, the distance of an object can be determined in terms of its position and in many other ways. Words can be used to describe how far an object is. Diagrams or graphs can also help us to determine how far an object is in a descriptive position. By using a diagram the position of the objects can be shown and determined through visuals along the coordinate of the number line. Activity 1: How far is the object? Directions: In the diagram below determine the distance of the following objects from a specific frame of reference and answer the following questions based on the diagram. -10m 5m Om 5m 10m 15m -15m Questions: 1. What is the distance of the dog along the coordinate number line? 2. What is the distance of the tree in the coordinate number line? 3.

Graphs highlight the salient features of the data. They can show relationships that are not obvious from studying a list of numbers. They can also provide a convenient way to compare different sets of data. Different situations call for different types of graphs, and it helps to have a good knowledge of what types are available. The type of data often determines what graph is appropriate to use. Qualitative data, quantitative data, and paired data each use different types of graphs. How do you pick the right chart or graph for your data? If you have data you want to visualize, make sure you use the right charts/graphs. While your data might work with multiple chart types, it's up to you to select the one that ensures your message is clear and accurate. Remember, data is only valuable if you know how to visualize it and give context.​</a>

Images or graphics display information which cannot be expressed in letters and words.13. Examples of multimedia are charts, graphs, tables, and diagrams.14. Visual elements are included in the text to help the readers "hear” what they are reading.15. Multimedia elements use more than one type of medium.16. Multimedia is the only way that can help readers clarify the meaning of the text.17. Visuals or interactive images help the readers to understand the unfamiliar words in the text.18. Visual or a video presentation of a text can demonstrate and show what the character is feeling or thinkingthrough their facial expressions and body language.19. The interaction between the audience and multimedia program involves the use of text, graphics, audio, videoand animation20.

                            6. How can distance be determined? It can be determined through describing it by means of visuals. Also, the distance of an object can be determined in terms of its position and in many other ways. Words can be used to describe how far an object is. Diagrams or graphs can also help us to determine how far an object is in a descriptive position. By using a diagram the position of the objects can be shown and determined through visuals along the coordinate of the number line. Activity 1: How far is the object?

Create a story behind the given graph below, write at least 5 insights based the graph. 4th Grading 1st Grading 2nd Grading 3rd Grading 4th Grading 17% LESSON 2: GRAPHS COMMONLY USED IN STATISTICS Good graphs convey information quickly and easily to the user. Graphs highlight the salient features of the data. They can show relationships that are not obvious from studying a list of numbers. They can also provide a convenient way to compare different sets of data. Different situations call for different types of graphs, and it helps to have a good knowledge of what types are available. The type of data often determines what graph is appropriate to use. Qualitative data, quantitative data, and paired data each use different types of graphs. How do you pick the right chart or graph for your data? If you have data you want to visualize, make sure you use the right charts/graphs. While your data might work with multiple chart types, it's up to you to select the one that ensures your message is clear and accurate. Remember, data is only valuable if you know how to visualize it and give context.​</h2><br />

                        Answer:<br /><br />1.) Line graph<br /><br />Explanation:<br />A line graph is a graphical display of information that changes continuously over time.<br /><br />2.) Pie chart<br /><br />Explanation:<br />A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice, is proportional to the quantity it represents.<br /><br />3.) Concept diagram <br /><br />Explanation:<br />A concept map or conceptual diagram is a diagram that depicts suggested relationships between concepts. It is a graphical tool that designers, engineers, technical writers, and others use to organize and structure knowledge.<br /><br />4.) Venn diagram <br /><br />Explanation:<br />A Venn diagram is a visual depiction of the similarities and differences between two or more different items. It consists of a series of shapes - usually circles - whose edges overlap. Venn diagrams are useful in any situation requiring a direct comparison of two or more categories or concepts.<br /><br />5.) Bar graph<br /><br />Explanation:<br />A bar graph (also known as a bar chart or bar diagram) is a visual tool that uses bars to compare data among categories. A bar graph may run horizontally or vertically. The important thing to know is that the longer the bar, the greater its value.<br /><br />6.) Linear text<br /><br />Explanation:<br />Linear text refers to traditional text that needs to be read from beginning to the end while nonlinear text refers to text that does not need to be read from beginning to the end.<br /><br />7.) Non-Linear text<br /><br />Explanation:<br />(Again)<br />Linear text refers to traditional text that needs to be read from beginning to the end while nonlinear text refers to text that does not need to be read from beginning to the end.<br /><br />8.) Reading path<br /><br />Explanation:<br />READING PATH. It is the way that the text or text plus other features, can determine or order the way the we read it.<br /><br />9.) Pictograph<br /><br />Explanation:<br />Pictograph. A pictograph uses pictures or symbols to display data instead of bars. Each picture represents a certain number of items.<br /><br />10.)
