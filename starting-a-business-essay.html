                                            Arrange the parts of the essay in logical order. It should start from introduction to conclusion. "What Makes a Speech?"In any speech, all these appeals- logical, emotional, and ethical- work together to convince the audience. When using the ethical appeal, the speaker must strike the audience as a sensible, good person if they are to believe his message. In addition to logic, emotional appeal is a powerful means of swaying people, especially groups. Most rhetoricians agree that any argument must be based on logic; that is, it must appeal to the intellect of the listeners. Speeches are not magic. They are not some combination of sorcery and show business. In fact, to win support from an audience, a speaker may use three major appeals: logical, emotional, and ethical.​</a>

                                            Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

In addition to logic, emotional appeal is a powerful means of swaying people, especially groups. Most rhetoricians agree that any argument must be based on logic; that is, it must appeal to the intellect of the listeners. Speeches are not magic.

                            16. Read the essay in the box and do what is asked.Some people believe that everyone needs a college degree. Educationis important, but I don’t think a four-year university education is needed tobe successful in our society.Electricians, plumbers, and carpenters go through specialized trainingin their fields. They don’t need to be college graduates to do their work.Blue-collar workers are the backbones of our society. Where would we be ifno one took vocational training? Who would repair our cars and unclog oursinks? The college-educated professional won’t do it. Unskilled work isimportant too. Dishwashers and taxi drivers may not have even a highschool education, but many people rely on the services they provide.On the other hand, a practical education combined with college coursesin business administration might mean the difference between being anelectrician and owning a successful electrical contracting business. BillGates is a good example. He started building computers from kits when hewas in high school. He went to Harvard for a while, but he dropped out sothat he could pursue his own idea of creating an operating system forpersonal computers. He invented DOS (disk operating system) andfounded Microsoft.In conclusion, people should have a chance to receive the highestlevel of education that their potential and effort allow. It’s great to havesome college experience, because it exposes you to new people andideas, but it is not necessary for everyone to receive a four-year universityeducation.Source: Literature.

                            25. Suppose you are starting a business. Among the forms of business, what would you rather choose: sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or a cooperative? Explain your answer through an essay that has a minimum of 10 sentences. Observe proper margin and indention, it should also have an introduction, body, and conclusion.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Sole proprietorship forms by far the most common form of business ownership for start ups. Numerous ways of starting businesses are available to entrepreneurs but still this is most preferred. Several reasons can be attributed to this situation. These reasons could include the autonomy one requires. As opposed to partnership and companies that may limit the freedom with which one operates, sole proprietorship allows the business man independence.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage accruing to this type of business is that it is easier and faster for the business man to make decisions in the business. This is because interruptions in making decisions are few. These decisions may not end up being the best as it were. Some people would want to be their own bosses and this point of not being accountable to any other person like the case is in partnership and sole proprietorship will drive the person to form a sole proprietorship business.</p><p></p><p>The legal requirements to the formation of a sole proprietorship are not as many as those found in other forms of business organizations like the companies. Sole proprietorship has very few requirements. Only registration and the acquisition of trading licenses are necessary. It takes a short time to as compared to other forms of business organizations.</p><p></p><p>Formation of this type of business is very easy and one can start it with very little capital. This would then inspire one simply to get into this form of business. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>  If I were to start a business, I would choose to supply agricultural products.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>One of the reasons is that I have always been passionate about farming and the environment. I believe that farming can help reduce pollution and increase food security in our country. It is also important to note that there are many people who do not have access to good quality food due to their income, location, or education level. With the right ingredients and knowledge, farmers can grow their own crops and sell them at market prices to make some extra money for themselves and their families.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Another reason why I would choose this sector is that it is not very competitive at this time with many companies entering this space recently; however, given my skill set and expertise in marketing, sales, and distribution channels management, I believe that my company would be able to compete successfully against other players in this market space by offering high-quality products at affordable prices.</strong></p><p><strong><br />PS. this is 166 words only, you may add 134 words from your own words.
