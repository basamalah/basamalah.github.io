Once two friends were walking through the forest. They knew that anything dangerous can happen to them at any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would remain united in any case of danger. Suddenly, they saw a large bear approaching them. One of the friends at once climbed a nearby tree. But the other one did not know how to climb. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless, pretending to be a dead man. The bear came near the man lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place. Because the bears do not touch the dead creatures. Now the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear tell you into your ears?"The other friend replied, "The bear advised me not to believe a false friend." Moral: True friend is the one who always supports and stands by you in any situation. - What are the Adverbs in the Story? - What Each Adverb Modifies? ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Sarah who lived in a small village at the edge of a forest. Every day, she would wake up early in the morning and go to the forest to collect firewood. She would spend most of the day gathering enough wood to last her family for the week.</p><p></p><p>One day, as she was walking through the forest, she heard a strange noise. She looked around, but she couldn't see anything. She continued walking, but the noise grew louder and more persistent. Suddenly, she saw a bright light shining through the trees.</p><p></p><p>Curiously, she followed the light until she came to a clearing. There, she saw a group of fairies dancing and singing around a magical tree. The fairies welcomed Sarah and invited her to join in their dance.</p><p></p><p>For hours, Sarah danced and sang with the fairies. As the sun began to set, she realized that she had lost track of time. She knew that she needed to hurry home before it got dark. She said goodbye to the fairies and ran back to her village as fast as she could.</p><p></p><p>When she arrived home, her family was worried about her. They had been looking for her all afternoon. Sarah explained what had happened, and her family was amazed. They had never heard of fairies in the forest before.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, Sarah would often go to the forest to dance and sing with the fairies. However, she always made sure to keep track of the time, so she wouldn't worry her family again. And every time she saw the fairies, she knew that she had to hurry home before it got dark.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>correct me if im wrong </p><br />

She had always dreamed of exploring the world, but she was too afraid to leave the safety of her home.</p><p></p><p>One day, as she was walking through the forest, she heard a rustling sound. Curiosity getting the best of her, she cautiously walked towards the sound. Suddenly, she saw a brightly colored bird fly past her with incredible speed.</p><p></p><p>Amazed by the bird's speed, she ran after it as quickly as she could, jumping over logs and dodging trees. Eventually, the bird led her to a beautiful waterfall, where it perched on a nearby rock.
