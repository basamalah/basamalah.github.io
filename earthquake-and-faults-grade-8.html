An Active fault has generated earthquakes before and is capable of causing more in the future. 2. PAGASA is an agency in our country that&#039;s chargeable for monitoring and observing earthquake and tsunami occurrence.3. An inactive fault is a structure that we can identify but which do not have earthquakes.4. Infanta fault, Digdig fault and Central Marinduque tautt are the active fault in Queran Province5. If two earthquakes of equal strength have the same epicenter, the one with the shalower focus causes more damage 6. Fault line is the spot directly above the focus on the surface of the earth.7. Epicenter is the origin of earthquake8. The San Andreas is a normal fault9. When an earthquakes occur shaking would be greater near the epicenter. 10.

                                            Grade 8TITLE: Where does an earthquake start?Objectives: After performing this activity, you should be able to: 1. differentiate between focus and epicenter; and 2. demonstrate how movement along faults affect the surroundings. Materials Needed: fault model scissors paste Procedure:1. Use attached photocopy (the Fault Model). Then cut along the outlines of the two drawings.2. Fold along the lines and paste where indicated. In the end, you should have a model consisting of two parts that fit together. (see figure below) FOCUS3. The upper surface of the model represents the surface of the Earth. The trace of the fault on the surface of the Earth is called the fault line. Be ready topoint out the fault line when your teacher calls on you. 4. Pull the two pieces apart (Figure 14). The flat surface between the two pieces is called the fault plane. This is where fault slip or fault movement happens. Point out the fault plane when your teacher asks you. 5. The place where the fault begins to slip is called the focus. It is where the first movement occurs. Thus, the focus is the origin of the earthquake. 6. Put the two pieces of the model together. The focus is now hidden "underground." Now, imagine a vertical line from the focus to the upper surface of the model. Mark the place where you expect the line to come out.Question:Use your model to show different types of movement along a fault.How would the surroundings be affected?​​​</a>

Houses, buildings, and other structures are inspected. People are interviewed about what the intensity of an earthquake is determined by observing the ____ of the earthquake in different places. Houses, buildings, and other structures are ____. People are interviewed about what they saw (the cabinet fell over), how they _____ (I was frightened), or what they did (I ran out of the house).(B) Another way of describing the strength of an earthquake is by _____. Recall that as rocks bend along the a fault, energy is stored little by little. When the rocks suddenly snap, the _____ is released. The released energy can be calculated by scientist and is called the magnitude of the earthquake. The greater the magnitude, the stronger the earthquake. To distinguish the two, intensity is expressed using ____ (I, II, III) while magnitude uses _____ (2, 3, 4).Earthquakes with a magnitude of ___ may or may not be felt. Those that are felt by most people have a magnitude of ___. Magnitude ___ quakes can lead to a lot of damage in highly populated areas. Earthquakes with a magnitude of ___ can causes severe damage.

                            7. Grade 8TITLE: Where does an earthquake start?Objectives: After performing this activity, you should be able to: 1. differentiate between focus and epicenter; and 2. demonstrate how movement along faults affect the surroundings. Materials Needed: fault model scissors paste Procedure:1. Use attached photocopy (the Fault Model). Then cut along the outlines of the two drawings.2. Fold along the lines and paste where indicated. In the end, you should have a model consisting of two parts that fit together. (see figure below) FOCUS3. The upper surface of the model represents the surface of the Earth. The trace of the fault on the surface of the Earth is called the fault line. Be ready topoint out the fault line when your teacher calls on you. 4. Pull the two pieces apart (Figure 14). The flat surface between the two pieces is called the fault plane. This is where fault slip or fault movement happens. Point out the fault plane when your teacher asks you. 5. The place where the fault begins to slip is called the focus. It is where the first movement occurs. Thus, the focus is the origin of the earthquake. 6. Put the two pieces of the model together. The focus is now hidden "underground." Now, imagine a vertical line from the focus to the upper surface of the model. Mark the place where you expect the line to come out.Question:Use your model to show different types of movement along a fault.How would the surroundings be affected?​​​</h2><br />

                            9. (A) The ____ of an earthquake is determined by observing the effects of the ____ in different places. Houses, buildings, and other structures are inspected. People are interviewed about what the intensity of an earthquake is determined by observing the ____ of the earthquake in different places. Houses, buildings, and other structures are ____. People are interviewed about what they saw (the cabinet fell over), how they _____ (I was frightened), or what they did (I ran out of the house).(B) Another way of describing the strength of an earthquake is by _____. Recall that as rocks bend along the a fault, energy is stored little by little. When the rocks suddenly snap, the _____ is released. The released energy can be calculated by scientist and is called the magnitude of the earthquake. The greater the magnitude, the stronger the earthquake. To distinguish the two, intensity is expressed using ____ (I, II, III) while magnitude uses _____ (2, 3, 4).Earthquakes with a magnitude of ___ may or may not be felt. Those that are felt by most people have a magnitude of ___. Magnitude ___ quakes can lead to a lot of damage in highly populated areas. Earthquakes with a magnitude of ___ can causes severe damage. A magnitude ___ quake results in widespread destruction, especially near the epicentre. Luckily, only ___ occur every year.Grade - 8 help please1-15 kapag masagot mo ii follow kita agad​</h2><br />
