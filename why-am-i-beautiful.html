                                            I, TOO, SING AMERICA
By Langston Hughes
I, too, sing America
I am the darker brother
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes
But I laugh,
And eat well
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I'll sit at the table
When company comes
Nobody will dare
Say to me,
"Eat in the kitchen"
Then.
Besides,
They'll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed
I, too, am America

                                            Flowers and Vegetables A famous poet once said, “My love is like a red, red rose.” I enjoy that poem because I also think red roses are beautiful. That’s why I grow them in my garden. My brother Jessie, doesn’t like flowers. He grows vegetables in his garden – peas, carrots, lettuce, and string beans. Jessie says that vegetables growing in a garden are the most beautiful. Both Jessie and I enjoy working in our gardens. Our favorite time is early in the morning when the weather is cool, and dew covers every leaf. This summer, I will enter my roses in the flower show. Maybe, I’ll win first place! Jessie doesn’t like to enter contests, but he’s just as proud of his peas and carrots as I am of my roses.The clue word in the fourth paragraph that show comparison is*A. favoriteB. bothC. earlyD. garden​</a>

A Broken Promise Once upon a time, in a faraway forest, there was an eagle who had been looking for a mate for quite a long time. She searched the vastness of the forest every single day, but found no male eagle to be her partner. Feeling hopeless, the eagle perched upon the branch of an old tree. The kite observed the eagle sighing in despair. He came to her and asked, "Why do I see you with such a sorrowful look? Ever since I met you, you have exhausted yourself flying to and fro every day." "I am looking for a suitable mate," the eagle replied. "Unfortunately, I cannot find one." The kite, who had secretly admired the beauty of the eagle, moved closer and said, “Then take me.

Once upon a time, in a faraway forest, there was an eagle who had
been looking for a mate for quite a long time. She searched the vastness
of the forest every single day, but found no male eagle to be her partner.
Feeling hopeless, the eagle perched upon the branch of an old tree.
The kite observed the eagle sighing in despair. He came to her and
asked, "Why do I see you with such a sorrowful look? Ever since I met
you, you have exhausted yourself flying to and fro every day."
"I am looking for a suitable mate," the eagle replied. "Unfortunately, I
cannot find one."
The kite, who had secretly admired the beauty of the eagle, moved
closer and said, "Then take me. I am not your kind but I can do the things
you do. In fact, I am stronger than you."

                            4. I, TOO, SING AMERICA
By Langston Hughes
I, too, sing America
I am the darker brother
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes
But I laugh,
And eat well
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I'll sit at the table
When company comes
Nobody will dare
Say to me,
"Eat in the kitchen"
Then.
Besides,
They'll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed
I, too, am America

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. Because he speaks from the point of view of an oppressed African-American the poem's struggles and future changes seem to be of greater importance than they ordinarily would. The point of view of being the oppressed African American is clearly evident in Langston Hughes's writing.<p></p>2.In the poem, Hughes describes a ubiquitous racial oppression that degrades African Americans at the time. He writes from the perspective of an inferior servant to a domineering white family that shoos him away to the kitchen whenever company arrives.<p></p>3.The poem expresses how he felt like an unforgotten American citizen because of his skin color. In the short poem, Hughes proclaims that he, too, is an American, even though the dominant members of society are constantly pushing him aside and hiding him away because he is an African American.<p></p>4.In large graven letters on the wall of the newly opened National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall is a quote from poet Langston Hughes: “I, too, am  America.<p></p>5.In a community where people are being treated fair everyone works together, solves problems easily, has fun, cares for one another, feels safe and gets along. That is a way that many people want to live. It should be important to a person to act with fairness. If you do this people will respect and trust you.<p></p>6.We cannot form the I-Thou relationships that Buber speaks of until we have learned to notice, soothe, and understand the emotions and patterns of our threat brain. When in threat, we are always compelled to use other people as objects who can save and protect us, or who we can blame for our problems.<p></p>7.=Encourage children to stand up for a friend if someone else is calling them namesm<p></p>=Encourage all children to follow rules and make sure the rules are the same for everyone.<p></p>=Sharing things with others is a great way of encouraging equality and fairness.<p></p>8.The dentist says she is not prepared to treat her anymore because of her behaviour. The dentist is refusing Jeannette a service because of behaviour related to her disability. This may be discrimination arising from disability.<p></p>9.Creating an inclusive culture that has respect for all cultures and religions.<p></p>10.Central to ILO’s work since its founding in 1919 is promotion of equality between women and men and ending discrimination in the world of work. Combating discrimination through promotion of equality is an essential component in the Decent Work Common Agenda.  Discrimination stifles development opportunities for workers, indigenous and tribal peoples, women, children, people with disabilities, workers with HIV/AIDS, and other socially isolated sectors of society.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>( &lt;&gt; )<p></p><br />

Then, I am not intelligent.2) If I have dark skin, then I am not beautiful. I have dark skin. Therefore, I am not beautiful.​</h2><br />
                        <p>1.) Just because you aren't good at one subject, does not mean you are not intelligent. People have flaws, weaknesses and strengths and classifying people that are not good at one thing does not hold a strong argument.</p><p></p><p>2.) Skin color is only a physical trait that no one can control. Being seen as beautiful depends on the inside or the attitude and the personality of that person. People who say that "dark skin is not beautiful" are racist and only care about physical traits.</p><p></p><br />

That’s why I grow them in my garden. My brother Jessie, doesn’t like flowers. He grows vegetables in his garden – peas, carrots, lettuce, and string beans. Jessie says that vegetables growing in a garden are the most beautiful. Both Jessie and I enjoy working in our gardens. Our favorite time is early in the morning when the weather is cool, and dew covers every leaf. This summer, I will enter my roses in the flower show. Maybe, I’ll win first place!

A Broken Promise Once upon a time, in a faraway forest, there was an eagle who had been looking for a mate for quite a long time.

The kite observed the eagle sighing in despair. He came to her and asked, "Why do I see you with such a sorrowful look? Ever since I met you, you have exhausted yourself flying to and fro every day." "I am looking for a suitable mate," the eagle replied. "Unfortunately, I cannot find one." The kite, who had secretly admired the beauty of the eagle, moved closer and said, “Then take me.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Stance can be defined as the attitude that the writer has towards the topic of his or her message. The stance that you take will greatly determine the tone of your message and the words that you choose. Notice, for example, how the authors in the following examples describe the same event that they attended. Their impressions of the event were very different, and it is reflected in the stance that they took.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Once we got to the food section of the event, I immediately realized that there was little to no organization. There was trash all over the place, with no trashcan in sight. There was a serious lack of tables to eat at, so many people were forced to eat standing up, which got really messy because of the nature of some of the foods. Many of the organizations that were selling the foods apparently didn’t talk to each other, because I saw many of the same kinds of rice, fish, even bread at the different tables.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

Once upon a time, in a faraway forest, there was an eagle who had
been looking for a mate for quite a long time. She searched the vastness
of the forest every single day, but found no male eagle to be her partner.
Feeling hopeless, the eagle perched upon the branch of an old tree.
The kite observed the eagle sighing in despair. He came to her and
asked, "Why do I see you with such a sorrowful look? Ever since I met
you, you have exhausted yourself flying to and fro every day."
"I am looking for a suitable mate," the eagle replied. "Unfortunately, I
cannot find one."
The kite, who had secretly admired the beauty of the eagle, moved
closer and said, "Then take me. I am not your kind but I can do the things
you do. In fact, I am stronger than you."

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p><p>1. <strong>Limes</strong> are a type of citrus fruit that are known for their sour taste. They are similar in appearance to lemons, but they are smaller and have a green color. The inside of a lime is divided into segments, similar to an orange, and the juice is sour and acidic.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Die</strong> is a small cube-shaped object that is typically made of plastic or paper, and used for various games and other activities. It has six faces, each of which is marked with a number of dots, called pips, typically from one to six. The die is thrown or rolled, and the number of dots on the uppermost face determine the outcome of the roll. </p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Flowers</strong> are beautiful and colorful plants that are often found in gardens and other outdoor spaces. They come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors and can be enjoyed for their aesthetic value and also for the fragrance they produce. They are unique in their beauty and are not capable of flying.</p><p></p><p>4.  <strong>Leaf</strong> is a flattened structure, typically green in color, that is attached to a stem of a plant. It's the main organ that performs photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Leaves are usually soft and delicate in texture, and come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. They are an important part of a plant and play a vital role in the survival of the plant.</p><br />
