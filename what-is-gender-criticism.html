                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The next step involves proposing solutions to address constraints or opportunities uncovered during analysis. Keep in mind that you’re constructing an argument—a narrative that nudges key stakeholders toward a set of proposed recommendations. Your argument will be vetted and challenged and it’s likely that choices will have to be made regarding which recommendations can be implemented. That said, it’s important to remember that you’re providing data for decision making and proposing changes, so you’ll need to back up your advice with good reasoning.</p><p></p><p>2.1  Findings</p><p>Findings emerge from the qualitative and quantitative analyses. Findings are typically divided into sections by technical area, following the outline established in the field guide. Be sure to highlight gender-relevant findings. Furthermore, be prepared for new or surprising findings that may emerge, as these may require modifications to the original outline. Every assessment report includes a description of the private health sector, sometimes referred to as the private sector “landscape.” Though there are many ways the information can be presented, it is useful to have a visual graphic to illustrate the myriad actors and organizations.</p><p></p><p>Key questions to be addressed in the description of the private health sector include:</p><p></p><p>Who are the key actors in the private health sector?</p><p>What specific health services and products are delivered by private providers? At what price?</p><p>What population groups do they serve (gender, income, urban/rural, special groups)?</p><p>How is the private health sector organized? What are the linkages with the overall health system?</p><p>What are the sources of private health expenditures?</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Recommendations are arguably the most important part of the analysis phase—this is where you’ll suggest specific interventions or strategies to address the issues and constraints identified in the assessment.</p><p></p><p>Recommendations should directly respond to key findings arrived at through data collection and analysis. A process of prioritization is essential to narrowing down findings, and once this is done, recommendations should be developed that align with the most important findings. Use the abbreviated Gender Analysis and Integration Matrix (GAIM) on 1.4 to prioritize gender findings and determine at which level(s) you may wish to intervene. Will your resulting program/project/strategy address a root cause? Will it seek to accommodate or transform existing gender norms?</p><p></p><p>Reviewing previous assessment reports may be helpful at this stage, to learn what strategies were recommended to address specific private sector constraints in other countries. This table synthesizes key problems affecting service delivery in the private sector, drawing from previous assessments, and links them to potential interventions.</p><p></p><p>RESOURCE ► When examining the supply chain in Nigeria, our assessment team identified weak regulation of drug vendors as a main area of concern. This lack of enforcement was compromising drug quality without increasing access where it was most needed. Given this finding, we proposed designing a pilot pharmaceutical network that would achieve the following:</p><p></p><p>Create a new scope of practice, with higher training levels but a larger range of products and services authorized, with supervision by pharmacists.</p><p>Conduct pooled procurement and distribution for network members</p><p>Increase access to credit to establish and expand business</p><p>Strengthen supervision and quality monitoring of retail outlets by a network franchisor</p><p>Conduct joint branding of all pharmacies in the network to promote quality and increase clientele</p><br />

                        <p>Stereotyping women limits their potential and should be considered one of the most serious types of violence against women. It not only prevents women from participating fully and equitably in all aspects of their lives, but it also diminishes and diminishes women's dignity.

                            9. in what ways can the feminist approach in literary criticism help us better understand the representation of gender and the experiences of women in literature?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The feminist approach in literary criticism can help us better understand how gender is represented and constructed in literature, and how this representation reflects and reinforces cultural norms and power relations. By examining the portrayal of female characters, feminist critics can uncover the ways in which women are often marginalized, objectified, or stereotyped in literature. They can also explore how women's experiences and perspectives are often overlooked or misrepresented, and how this can perpetuate patriarchal attitudes and values.</p><p></p><p>Feminist literary criticism can also help us understand the historical and social context in which literature is produced and received, and how this context shapes the representation of gender. For example, feminist critics can analyze the ways in which literary works respond to or challenge social and political movements such as the women's suffrage movement or the feminist movement of the 1960s and 70s. They can also examine the ways in which literary works reflect or resist dominant cultural myths and ideologies about women, such as the idea of the "angel in the house" or the "femme fatale."</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, feminist literary criticism can help us recognize the diversity of women's experiences and identities, and the ways in which these experiences intersect with other social categories such as race, class, and sexuality. By examining the representation of women from different backgrounds and perspectives, feminist critics can challenge essentialist and stereotypical notions of femininity, and promote a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of gender and identity in literature.</p><p></p><br />

Psychological research on gender,which has most often focused on analysis of sex differences, within-sex variability, and gender roles,has begun to incorporate this new understanding.

                        Answer:Gender Criticism-Gender criticism is an extension of feminist literary criticism, focusing not just on women but on the construction of gender and sexuality, especially LGBTQ issues, which gives rise to queer theory. ... Thus identity is complicated and rich, involving much more than gender alone.Feminist Criticism-Feminist criticism is concerned with "the ways in which literature (and other cultural productions) reinforce or undermine the economic, political, social, and psychological oppression of women" Historical-of, relating to, or having the character of history historical data. b : based on history historical novels. c : used in the past and reproduced in historical presentations.Reader Response Criticism-Reader-response criticism is a school of literary theory that focuses on the reader (or “audience”) and their experience of a literary work, in contrast to other schools and theories that focus attention primarily on the author or the content and form of the work.Structuralism-Structuralism is a mode of knowledge of nature and human life that is interested in relationships rather than individual objects or, alternatively, where objects are defined by the set of relationships of which they are part and not by the qualities possessed by them taken in isolation.Sociological-Sociology is a social science that focuses on society, human social behaviour, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and aspects of culture associated with everyday life. <br />

                        <p>When there is only one gender represented in an experiment, results can be skewed.
