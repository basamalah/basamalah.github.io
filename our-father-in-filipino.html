FATHER’S DAY MESSAGE
First of all, I would like to address that not every father is perfect. Every human makes a mistake at least once in his or her life. And these include both of our parents, especially our fathers.
Our fathers are considered as the head of the family, and for understandable reasons, they are responsible for taking care for the family as a whole. While a mother may be the light, the father will be the leader.
But we take the role of our fathers for granted, with modern times rushing in, the role of fathers seem to be less prominent than it ever was before.  With single mothers increasing every day and most fathers disappearing.
But for the fathers that stuck around, I would like to thank yous. Thank you for facing your problems, thank you for staying with us even though you knew for a fact that being a father come with great responsibility.
More specifically, I would like to thank my dad for staying with us for this long. Dealing with our problems and incompetency with such patience, and even though there were some moments where things go wrong, you still stood d up by our side.
And for the fathers that didn’t
I honestly can’t blame you</a>

FATHER’S DAY MESSAGE
First of all, I would like to address that not every father is perfect. Every human makes a mistake at least once in his or her life. And these include both of our parents, especially our fathers.
Our fathers are considered as the head of the family, and for understandable reasons, they are responsible for taking care for the family as a whole. While a mother may be the light, the father will be the leader.
But we take the role of our fathers for granted, with modern times rushing in, the role of fathers seem to be less prominent than it ever was before.  With single mothers increasing every day and most fathers disappearing.
But for the fathers that stuck around, I would like to thank yous. Thank you for facing your problems, thank you for staying with us even though you knew for a fact that being a father come with great responsibility.
More specifically, I would like to thank my dad for staying with us for this long. Dealing with our problems and incompetency with such patience, and even though there were some moments where things go wrong, you still stood d up by our side.
And for the fathers that didn’t
I honestly can’t blame you</h2><br />

Americans always say that Filipinos make the best soldiers. There’s nothing that Filipinos cannot overcome without their sheer will and determination. Filipinos are so profoundly resilient it’s not even a joke, they can break stones.</p><p>3.Almost all people affected by emergencies will experience psychological distress, which for most people will improve over time.</p><p>Among people who have experienced war or other conflict in the previous 10 years, one in 11 (9%) will have a moderate or severe mental disorder.</p><p>One person in five (22%) living in an area affected by conflict is estimated to have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.</p><p>Depression tends to be more common among women than men.</p><p>Depression and anxiety become more common as people get older.</p><p>People with severe mental disorders are especially vulnerable during emergencies and need access to mental health care and other basic needs.</p><p>4.Three months have passed since the Philippines implemented strict community quarantines across the archipelago.</p><p></p><p>With no mass testing in place, many still fear the coronavirus will spread, threatening thousands of workers who risk their lives to earn a living. The healthcare system will be on the brink of collapse once a fraction of its employees are infected by the virus.</p><p>Reports say thousands of overseas Filipino workers have used up their savings to pay for their quarantine facilities while some are still on cruise ships docked in Philippine ports.</p><p></p><p>A month ago, a repatriated overseas worker hanged herself while undergoing a 14-day quarantine in a state facility. A few days ago, another jumped off a building in Beirut, Lebanon. The pandemic has not only caused poverty but also psychological distress.</p><p></p><p>Yet what sustains the Filipino people, especially those in the slums with almost nothing to eat? What inspires a country to thrive, even when its future is uncertain?</p><p></p><p>In World War II, bombs shattered the country. Our homes and churches were ruined. But the war never destroyed our faith as a people.</p><p></p><p>Jesuit historian Father Horacio de la Costa compared the war-torn Philippines to a pauper with two precious jewels. He wrote in his essay Jewels of the Pauper that the Philippines has two great treasures — faith and music.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p>I hope I can help you can you brainlest me sorry if it's to long</p><br />
