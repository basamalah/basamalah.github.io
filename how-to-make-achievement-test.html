Carefully choosing the best scale is necessary to achieve this. The graph should always have a title. Always label the x and y-axes in 3 ways: title, numerical values, and units. Always make a line graph; line graphs are much handier, because they tell you how one thing changes under the influence of some other variable. The x-axis is always the independent variable. If time is one of the measurements being graphed, it always goes on the x-axis. Independent Variable or Manipulated Variable is what you are testing. It is what causes things to change as you make changes to it. Some people nickname it the l-do variable. The lines that make up the grids should be equally spaced and it be assigned equal values. The assumption of values should be in an ascending manner from the point of origin. The independent variable should lie along the x while dependent variable should lie along the y. ​</a>

The aim of this test was to help prevent osteoporosis, whilethe emphasis was on its bioavailability in target tissues3. This kind of oil has high stability during baking, meaning it doesnot need to go through the chemical process of hydrogenation,which produces unwanted trans fats.

This is a small invasive species, and we know a great deal aboutits genes. This little plant helps us understand the hereditary natureof numerous plant characteristics relating to: drought, low nitrogenrequirements5.

The same principle applies to these apples as tothe previously mentioned onions: it is not about adding genes butabout downregulating the activity of the existing ones6. a study describing how they had transferred a gene from adecorative plant into a tomato, which enabled the productionof anthocyanin, making the tomato dark blue. They later tested it onmice, and discovered that it prevents them from getting cancer7. The lack of this vitamin is especially harmful to the poorest and isestimated to cause blindness. Because of its colour, the product wasfirst given the name golden rice, which remains the same to this day8. Scientists have successfully used a genetic modification, insertinga pepper gene into bananas, which prevents the fruit from gettingthe disease.9. Frost-resistant eucalyptus trees are already being produced andused in the paper industry.

                            10. A teenager is troubled by pimples on her face. She tried different beauty products but her problem still persists. She searched for remedies online and she came across an advertisement that says "The face and body cream that you will surely love. Whitens the skins, removes pimples, decreases eye bags and prevents scar formation in just seven days! It has oil- control formula that leaves your face naturally radiant, smooth, and shine-free. It is hypo-allergenic and dermatologically tested to be mild even on sensitive skin." The product was put on sale and she immediately availed the buy one-take one promo. After using it for several days, in her dismay her pimples worsened and she noticed dark spots on her face. Questions: 1. What propaganda technique is used in the situation? What words or phrases do you think helped convince the customer to patronize the product?  2. In terms of language used, does the propaganda achieve its purpose? How? 3.

The advertiser also emphasizes that the product has an oil-control formula, is hypoallergenic, and dermatologically tested to be mild even on sensitive skin.<br />In terms of language used, the propaganda appears to have achieved its purpose of convincing the customer to buy the product. The advertiser used glittering generalities, which are designed to appeal to people's emotions and desires, rather than to their reason and logic. The advertiser used positive and appealing words and phrases to make the product seem like a miracle cure that can solve all of the teenager's skin problems in just seven days.<br />The teenager may not have made the right decision to immediately buy the product online without doing further research. The advertisement may have been misleading, and the product may not have been effective or safe for the teenager's skin. It is important to be cautious and do research before buying any product, especially those that make extraordinary claims.<br />The knowledge about propaganda techniques can help people become more critical and discerning consumers.

Carefully choosing the best scale is necessary to achieve this. The graph should always have a title. Always label the x and y-axes in 3 ways: title, numerical values, and units. Always make a line graph; line graphs are much handier, because they tell you how one thing changes under the influence of some other variable. The x-axis is always the independent variable. If time is one of the measurements being graphed, it always goes on the x-axis. Independent Variable or Manipulated Variable is what you are testing. It is what causes things to change as you make changes to it. Some people nickname it the l-do variable. The lines that make up the grids should be equally spaced and it be assigned equal values. The assumption of values should be in an ascending manner from the point of origin. The independent variable should lie along the x while dependent variable should lie along the y. ​</h2><br />

                            18. A teenager is troubled by pimples on her face. She tried different beauty products but her problem still persists. She searched for remedies online and she came across an advertisement that says "The face and body cream that you will surely love. Whitens the skins, removes pimples, decreases eye bags and prevents scar formation in just seven days! It has oil-control formula that leaves your face naturally radiant, smooth, and shine-free. It is hypo-allergenic and dermatologically tested to be mild even on sensitive skin." The product was put on sale and she immediately availed the buy- one-take one promo. After using it for several days, in her dismay her pimples worsened and she noticed dark spots on her face. Guide Questions: • What propaganda technique is used in the situation? What words or phrases do you think helped convince the customer to patronize the product? In terms of language used, does the propaganda achieve its purpose? How? Did the teenager make the right decision of immediately buying the product online? Why or why not? If you were the customer, would you do the same thing as the teenager did in the situation? Why? • How have your knowledge about propaganda technique so far influence your decision-making in supporting ideas, buying products, and availing services?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>• The propaganda technique used in the situation is "Bandwagon". The advertisement uses persuasive language to convince the customer that everyone is using the product and it is the best solution for her problem. The words and phrases that helped convince the customer to patronize the product include "surely love", "removes pimples", "naturally radiant", "hypo-allergenic", and "dermatologically tested". The propaganda achieves its purpose by making the customer believe that the product is effective and has been tested by experts.</p><p></p><p>• The teenager did not make the right decision of immediately buying the product online. She did not do enough research about the product and relied solely on the advertisement. She should have checked the product's reviews or consulted a dermatologist before purchasing it.</p><p></p><p>• If I were the customer, I would not do the same thing as the teenager did in the situation. I would first research the product, read reviews, and consult with a dermatologist to ensure the product is safe and effective.</p><p></p><p>• Knowledge about propaganda.                                                                            </p><p></p><p></p><p>techniques can greatly influence our decision-making when it comes to supporting ideas, buying products, and availing services. Being aware of propaganda techniques helps us to identify when we are being manipulated or persuaded to believe something that may not necessarily be true. It enables us to be critical and discerning consumers, and make informed decisions based on facts and evidence rather than emotions or persuasive language. It is important to always do our own research and seek out multiple sources of information before making any decisions, especially those that can affect our health or well-being.</p><br />

                            20. Description of the process1. the insertion of a single gene which downregulates the activity ofthe onion enzyme that makes your eyes water has managed toachieve two things: firstly, onions no longer make your eyes water2. they performed a study where such carrots were tested on miceand 30 volunteers, and the results showed that humans absorbed42% more calcium from the modified carrots than from regularones. The aim of this test was to help prevent osteoporosis, whilethe emphasis was on its bioavailability in target tissues3. This kind of oil has high stability during baking, meaning it doesnot need to go through the chemical process of hydrogenation,which produces unwanted trans fats. There is a similar vascular-system-friendly oil marketed by Monsanto with two inserted genesenabling the production of omega-3 fatty acids.4. This is a small invasive species, and we know a great deal aboutits genes. This little plant helps us understand the hereditary natureof numerous plant characteristics relating to: drought, low nitrogenrequirements5. The aim of this research is to prevent the most popular cultivarsfrom turning brown. The same principle applies to these apples as tothe previously mentioned onions: it is not about adding genes butabout downregulating the activity of the existing ones6. a study describing how they had transferred a gene from adecorative plant into a tomato, which enabled the productionof anthocyanin, making the tomato dark blue. They later tested it onmice, and discovered that it prevents them from getting cancer7. The lack of this vitamin is especially harmful to the poorest and isestimated to cause blindness. Because of its colour, the product wasfirst given the name golden rice, which remains the same to this day8. Scientists have successfully used a genetic modification, insertinga pepper gene into bananas, which prevents the fruit from gettingthe disease.9. Frost-resistant eucalyptus trees are already being produced andused in the paper industry. As for the leading crops, species thatsuccessfully grow with smaller doses of nitrogen and phosphorusare already being tested10. This includes modification of species resistant to harmfulinsects, where new species allow up to 80% less spraying.​</h2><br />

                            29. Situation: A teenager is troubled by pimples on her face. She tried different beauty products but her problem still persists. She searched for remedies online and she came across an advertisement that says. "The face and body cream that you will surely love. Whitens the skin removes pimples, decreases eye bags, and prevents scar formation in just seven days! It has an oil-control formula that leaves your face naturally radiant, smooth, and shine-free. It is hypo-allergenic and dermatologically tested to be mild even on sensitive skin." The product was put on sale and she immediately availed of the buy-one-take-one promo. After using it for several days, to her dismay, her pimples worsened and she noticed dark spots on her face. Guide Questions: 1. What propaganda technique is used in the situation? What words or phrases do you think helped convince the customer to patronize the product? 2. In terms of the language used, does the propaganda achieve its purpose? How? 3. Did the teenager make the right decision to immediately buy the product online? Why or why not? 4. If you were the customer, would you do the same thing as the teenager did in the situation? Why? 5. How have your knowledge about propaganda technique so far influence your decision-making in supporting ideas, buying products, and availing services?​</h2><br />
                        The propaganda technique used in the situation is glittering generalities. The words and phrases used in the advertisement such as "whitens the skin," "removes pimples," "decreases eye bags," "prevents scar formation," and "naturally radiant" are designed to sound impressive and desirable to the customer without actually providing any specific information about the product's ingredients, effectiveness, or safety.In terms of the language used, the propaganda technique achieves its purpose by appealing to the customer's desire for quick and easy solutions to their skin problems. However, the product's actual effectiveness and safety are not guaranteed, as evidenced by the teenager's negative experience.The teenager did not make the right decision to immediately buy the product online without conducting further research and consulting a dermatologist. While the advertisement sounded appealing, she should have considered the risks and potential side effects of using the product before making a purchase.As a customer, I would not make the same decision as the teenager did in the situation. I would research the product thoroughly and consult with a professional before purchasing any skincare products.My knowledge of propaganda techniques has influenced my decision-making by making me more aware of the tactics that companies may use to sell their products. I am now more likely to research and critically evaluate products and services before making a purchase.<p></p><br />
