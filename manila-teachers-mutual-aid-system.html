                        Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur both at the same time.The situations that are mutually exclusive would be:Event 1: I am at home eating.Event 2: I am taking an exam in school. I cannot be in different places at the same, so it is impossible to eat at home, and takean exam in school at the same time. Two events that are nonmutually exclusive would be:When I am rolling a die, event 1: I would roll an even number,event 2: I would roll a 6. They could happen at the same time, so, they are nonmutually exclusive events. <br />God bless! :)<br />

How might the land use patterns predicted by the model be altered by an increase in the market price of a single crop? A decrease in the transportation costs of one crop but not of all crops?</p><p>-Von Thunen's model: As distance from the model increases, the value of land decreases, Von Thunen developed a descriptive model of intensity of land use that holds up reasonably well in practice. The most intensively produced agricultural crops are found on land close to the market; the less intensively produced commodities are located at more-distant points. The numbered zones of the diagram represent modern equivalents of the theoretical land use sequence Von Thunen suggested some 185 years ago. As the metropolitan area at the center increases in size, the agricultural specialty areas are displaced outward, but the relative position of each is retained</p><p>-Perishable commodities such as fruits and vegetables have high transport rates per unit of distance; grain and other crops have lower rates. Land rent for any farm commodity decreases with increasing distance from the central market, and the rate of decline is determined by the transport gradient for that commodity. Crops that have both the highest market price and the highest transport costs will be grown nearest to the market. Less-perishable crops with lower production and transport costs will be grown at greater distances away</p><p></p><p>What economic or ecological problems can you cite that do or might affect the gathering industries of forestry and fishing?

                            23. Why is it important to understand the reciprocal relationship or mutual dependence between Human (persons) and Environmental (nature) systems?​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><strong>In recent years, social and natural scientists have gained interest in understanding reciprocal relations between human populations and the environment. Research methods have been developed for investigating the secrets of interations of human and environment. This paper describes the flora data collection methods used in a longitudinal research project “Reciprocal Relation Between Population and the Environment” and highlights how the research sites were selected, how the research plots were designed in each site and how the qualitative and quantitative data of flora found in each research plot were recorded. This paper also discusses how the flora data can be linked with sociodemographic data and how the data can be used to unfold the effect of human activities on flora diversity and/or the effect of flora on the life of the human population in the study area.</strong><strong>We can see tremendous interest of both natural as well as social scientists in the investigation of relationships between human populations and the environment (Subedi, 2000; Mathema, 2000). Each school of scientists works separately and develops the methodology for their purposes. As a result, ecologists give more attention to plants or animals or environment and less to human population (see Duwadi et al., 2002; Shrestha et al., 2002). Social scientists give more attention to human dimensions and work out and develop their methodologies (for example, Dahal, 2000; K.C., 1998). It is felt important to work together in collaborative research so that the secrets of the interrelationship between population and environment can be unfolded. To fill up the gap, we develop a longitudinal research project to study reciprocal relations between population and the environment. For this study we work together and develop methodology. In this paper, I attempt to highlight on (1) location of our research sites and plots, (2) design of research plots, and (3) data sets we collected. I also try to give appropriate examples of our methods.</strong><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Suppose there is a lottery that involves choosing three numbers from a pool of ten. Each number can only be chosen once. The event of selecting a particular number is mutually exclusive since once a number is chosen, it cannot be chosen again. Therefore, the events of choosing, for example, the numbers 3, 7, and 9 are mutually exclusive because once a number is selected, it is no longer available for selection.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the events of selecting a number that is odd and a number that is greater than five are non-mutually exclusive. It is possible to select a number that is both odd and greater than five, such as the number 7. Therefore, these events can occur simultaneously, and they are not mutually exclusive.</p><p></p><p>In summary, events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time, and non-mutually exclusive events can occur simultaneously. In the example of the lottery, selecting a particular number is mutually exclusive, and selecting an odd number and a number greater than five is non-mutually exclusive.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One event in my life that involves mutually exclusive events is when I had to choose between attending a family wedding or going on a school trip. The wedding was scheduled on the same date as the school trip, and I had to make a decision.</p><p></p><p>Attending the family wedding and going on the school trip were mutually exclusive events because I could not do both at the same time. If I decided to attend the wedding, I would miss out on the school trip, and if I went on the school trip, I would miss the wedding.</p><p></p><p>I had to weigh the pros and cons of each option. Attending the wedding was important to me because it was a family event, and I wanted to be there to celebrate with my relatives. On the other hand, going on the school trip was also important because it was an educational opportunity that would enhance my learning and broaden my horizons.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, I decided to go on the school trip. Although it was a difficult decision, I knew that I would regret missing out on the educational experience. I also realized that my family would understand my decision and that I could still celebrate with them in other ways.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the event of choosing between attending a family wedding or going on a school trip is an example of mutually exclusive events because I could not do both at the same time. It was a difficult decision to make, but I had to weigh the pros and cons of each option and choose the one that was most important to me.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Social Organization<p>In associate degree organized society, there's stability and alter. Stability is that the condition of equilibrium among the components of society. It is the state of smooth functioning. During this condition; the social issues decrease in society. Change is the dynamic condition of society. </p><p>An organized society is additionally ever-changing for the fulfillment of social desires. Abrupt changes in the form of revolution disrupt the existing social order and disorganization occurs in society. The examples of organization can easily be understood from the organs of human body which are technically joined together called organization of parts in human body. The parts of a table are prepared separately by the carpenter and then fitted together in a technical order. This table is an organized body. It means organization is arranging of parts into its whole. Similarly, grouping is a corporation of people into a unit. The people set themselves at their positions (status) and by interaction (role) they create a grouping. It means they are fitted themselves into the group according to their positions. This participation individuals into group is social organization.</p><p>The whole society is a big organization in which individuals, groups and institutions participate. It is a vast network of social relationship like the parts of a watch organized together. The groups interacts with other groups, thus, fitting themselves in and giving shape to society by organization: The process of organization resembles with:</p>a human bodya machinea factoryan officea bankhuman society<p></p>Examples of social organizations<p>Below are some of the examples of social organizations commonly found in our society</p>Environmental groupsNon government organizationsReligious groups<p></p><p>For additional information regarding <strong>society</strong>, refer to the following links:</p><p>Characteristics of <strong>society</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1706683</p><p>Definition of <strong>society</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/480632</p><p>The kinds of <strong>society</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/480632</p><p><strong>Answer:the answer is AUTHORITY</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The King’s Edict in Behalf of the Jews</p><p>8 That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her. 2 The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman’s estate.</p><p></p><p>3 Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews. 4 Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him.</p><p></p><p>5 “If it pleases the king,” she said, “and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces. 6 For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?”</p><p></p><p>7 King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have impaled him on the pole he set up. 8 Now write another decree in the king’s name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king’s signet ring—for no document written in the king’s name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.”</p><p></p><p>9 At once the royal secretaries were summoned—on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush.[a] These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language. 10 Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king’s signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king.</p><p></p><p>11 The king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack them and their women and children,[b] and to plunder the property of their enemies. 12 The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. 13 A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</p><p></p><p>14 The couriers, riding the royal horses, went out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa.</p><br />
