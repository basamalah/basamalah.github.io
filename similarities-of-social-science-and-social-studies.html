                                            Higher EducationBy Ronaldo SorianoA high-school seniors decision about whether to stand a community college ora four-year university can be difficult since similarities exist between both forms of highereducation At a university students work the first two years to complete their basiceducation requirements. Emphasis is when on survey classes plus writing math, socialscience, and science sequences. After studente fulf these mandatory requirementmay begin to work on courses related to their major or primary field of study. Alcommunity college many two-year degrees require survey courses and sequences ofclasses in the areas of writing math social science, and science Aner students completethese basic education requirements, they cam an Associates Degree and can thentransfer to the university to begin courses related to their major or primary field of study.At a university during the registration process, students usually have a choice of classes.professors, and class times. If several different sections of a course are available.students can select early moming, daytime, or evening classes. They can ohen grouptheir classes on Monday, Wednesday. Friday or Tuesday and Thursday The same istrue during the registration process at a community college. Students can select theirclasses, instructors, and class times as long as sections of the courses are availableOne additional similarity between the two forms of higher education involvesexpectations. At the university, professors expect students to be responsible to studywithout being reminded or reprimanded, and to leam to balance the different demandsand aspects of their personal and academic lives. These expectations stun manystudents during the first term as a freshman. They quickly have to learn to behave andthink more maturely and responsibly The same is true for students attending communitycolleges. At the community college, instructors expect students to be responsible for theirwork as well as with decisions in their personal lives. They expect students to studywithout being frequently reminded, lectured, or reprimanded. The responsibility forleaming shifts to the students. The students need to learn to balance the differentdemands and activities of their personal and academic lives Because both universitiesand community colleges are similar in so many ways, the decision to attend one or theother may best be made by looking at the differences rather than the similarities of the two forms of higher education.pleaseee need ng sagottt​</a>

In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions.

                                            Read the following summaries of the article titled, “Is your smartphone making you unhappy? by David Trilling. On a separate sheet of paper, explain if summary 1 deviates from the author’s words but retains the gist of the article or if the summary uses the author’s own word. Cite your evidence for saying so. Do the same for summary 2. Summary 1: Responding to the widespread notion that smartphones make a person unhappy, researchers from the University of British Columbia and the University of Virginia conducted two experiments about people’s use of smartphones in different situations. The study’s aim was to take the scientific approach in proving that face-to-face interactions, which have always been known to make people happy, are hampered as a result of people’s frequent use of their smartphones. The study cited that the participants who used their phones while interacting with others, found their interest level and enjoyment in face-to-face interactions to be lower, and they felt more distracted and bored. The participants also admitted that this slightly affected their well-being. The survey, which included a second experiment among university students, also pointed out that the use of smartphones suggests that the current generation, though very skillful with modern technology, is actually missing out on the benefits of face-to-face interactions. Summary 2: Researchers from the University of British Columbia and the University of Virginia claim that there is science behind the speculation that the use of smartphones may be making us less happy. According to a new paper by the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, two experiments that were conducted have shown similar findings of lowered interest and enjoyment in face-to-face interactions among the participants who used their smartphones while interacting with others. They also felt more distracted and more bored, with participants in the first experiment acknowledging a “small negative effect on well-being.” The study also pointed out that the negative effects of smartphones among university students, who were the subjects of the second survey, are more notable because while their generation is generally adept at multitasking, findings suggest that even moderate levels of phone use have deprived them of the emotional rewards of social interaction.

                            14. Higher EducationBy Ronaldo SorianoA high-school seniors decision about whether to stand a community college ora four-year university can be difficult since similarities exist between both forms of highereducation At a university students work the first two years to complete their basiceducation requirements. Emphasis is when on survey classes plus writing math, socialscience, and science sequences. After studente fulf these mandatory requirementmay begin to work on courses related to their major or primary field of study. Alcommunity college many two-year degrees require survey courses and sequences ofclasses in the areas of writing math social science, and science Aner students completethese basic education requirements, they cam an Associates Degree and can thentransfer to the university to begin courses related to their major or primary field of study.At a university during the registration process, students usually have a choice of classes.professors, and class times. If several different sections of a course are available.students can select early moming, daytime, or evening classes. They can ohen grouptheir classes on Monday, Wednesday. Friday or Tuesday and Thursday The same istrue during the registration process at a community college. Students can select theirclasses, instructors, and class times as long as sections of the courses are availableOne additional similarity between the two forms of higher education involvesexpectations. At the university, professors expect students to be responsible to studywithout being reminded or reprimanded, and to leam to balance the different demandsand aspects of their personal and academic lives. These expectations stun manystudents during the first term as a freshman. They quickly have to learn to behave andthink more maturely and responsibly The same is true for students attending communitycolleges. At the community college, instructors expect students to be responsible for theirwork as well as with decisions in their personal lives. They expect students to studywithout being frequently reminded, lectured, or reprimanded. The responsibility forleaming shifts to the students. The students need to learn to balance the differentdemands and activities of their personal and academic lives Because both universitiesand community colleges are similar in so many ways, the decision to attend one or theother may best be made by looking at the differences rather than the similarities of the two forms of higher education.pleaseee need ng sagottt​</h2><br />

Social Sciences are interrelated and interconnected disciplines that study man's social aspect. There are a handful of Social Science disciplines, and the way to distinguish them from each other is to look at their different (1) or focus of study. In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions. Family, friends, religion, economy, and mass media are some examples of structures or patterns of our interactions​</h2><br />

                            23. Read the following summaries of the article titled, “Is your smartphone making you unhappy? by David Trilling. On a separate sheet of paper, explain if summary 1 deviates from the author’s words but retains the gist of the article or if the summary uses the author’s own word. Cite your evidence for saying so. Do the same for summary 2. Summary 1: Responding to the widespread notion that smartphones make a person unhappy, researchers from the University of British Columbia and the University of Virginia conducted two experiments about people’s use of smartphones in different situations. The study’s aim was to take the scientific approach in proving that face-to-face interactions, which have always been known to make people happy, are hampered as a result of people’s frequent use of their smartphones. The study cited that the participants who used their phones while interacting with others, found their interest level and enjoyment in face-to-face interactions to be lower, and they felt more distracted and bored. The participants also admitted that this slightly affected their well-being. The survey, which included a second experiment among university students, also pointed out that the use of smartphones suggests that the current generation, though very skillful with modern technology, is actually missing out on the benefits of face-to-face interactions. Summary 2: Researchers from the University of British Columbia and the University of Virginia claim that there is science behind the speculation that the use of smartphones may be making us less happy. According to a new paper by the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, two experiments that were conducted have shown similar findings of lowered interest and enjoyment in face-to-face interactions among the participants who used their smartphones while interacting with others. They also felt more distracted and more bored, with participants in the first experiment acknowledging a “small negative effect on well-being.” The study also pointed out that the negative effects of smartphones among university students, who were the subjects of the second survey, are more notable because while their generation is generally adept at multitasking, findings suggest that even moderate levels of phone use have deprived them of the emotional rewards of social interaction.
