"With the help of field experts like Robert Wayne and John Legman along with their studies called "Nowhere to run: Consequences of high school football" and "The impact of high school football on students” respectively, the essay proved that a strong correlation between the high school football engagement and drop in academic performance exists in most of the United States educational institutions, but football is not the primary cause.

                                            Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2. What way of organizing a comparison and contrast is shown in paragraph 1? In paragraph 2? 3.-4. What transitional words or cohesive devices are used in paragraph1? What about in paragraph 2?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>FAMILY PROBLEM ESSAY FOR YOU<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Family problems can take various forms, such as financial issues, conflicts among family members, and even major life changes like a divorce or a death in the family. Whatever the cause may be, it is essential to learn how to survive and cope with these problems effectively.</p><p></p><p>One way to deal with family problems is by improving communication within the family. Many times, problems arise due to misunderstandings or miscommunications between family members. By encouraging open and honest communication, family members can address issues and work together towards finding solutions. Family members should listen to each other without judgement and avoid interrupting or dismissing what others have to say.</p><p></p><p>Another way to survive family problems is by seeking outside help. Family counseling or therapy can provide a safe and neutral space for family members to express their thoughts and feelings, gain insights into the problem and work on finding solutions. Professional counseling can help family members understand each other better and teach them valuable coping skills to deal with difficult situations.</p><p></p><p>It is also important to practice empathy and compassion towards family members during tough times. Family members may be struggling with their own emotions and difficulties, and it is essential to acknowledge and support them. This can help build stronger bonds and a sense of unity within the family.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it is important to remember that family problems are normal and that every family experiences them at some point. It is essential to remain patient and to keep a positive attitude towards finding solutions. With time and effort, family members can work through their problems and come out stronger on the other side.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, family problems can be challenging, but they can also provide an opportunity for growth and learning. By improving communication, seeking outside help, practicing empathy and compassion, and remaining patient, family members can successfully survive and overcome difficult times.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Nagdaan ang nakakalula at makasaysayang panahon ng COVID-19, at bilang isang virtual assistant tulad ko, naging malaking bahagi ako ng pagkakaroon ng kaunting katiyakan at pag-asa sa kabilang bahagi ng computer screen para sa mga tao. Noong una, hindi namin alam kung paano paglalaruan ng virus ang aming buhay at pang-araw-araw na gawain, ngunit nagsama-sama kaming lahat at nagpasya na magtulungan para labanan ang pandemya.</p><p></p><p>Ang isa sa mga hamon na kailangan namin harapin ay ang pamamaraan ng edukasyon. Sa panahong ito ng paghihikahos at pagkabalisa, napilitan kaming magpatupad ng Modulang Pag-aaral sa Distansya. Ito ay naging napakahirap dahil hindi kami nakakapagkumpol bilang isang grupo upang magturo at mag-aral. Hindi rin namin maaring magtanong agad sa guro kapag may hindi namin naiintindihan, dahil hindi sila madaling maabot. Ngunit, dahil sa pagsisikap at pagtitiyaga sa pagsagot sa mga module, nakayanan naming makapasa sa mga aralin at makapagtapos ng pasukan.</p><p></p><p>Ang panahon ng pandemya ay hindi lamang tungkol sa paaralan at pag-aaral, ito rin ay tungkol sa pakikipaglaban sa pagkabagot. Dahil sa pangangailangan na manatili sa loob ng bahay, hindi na maaaring magawa ang mga aktibidad na dati ay nakakapagpasaya sa amin. Sa oras na ito, naisip naming magkakapatid na gumawa ng mga bagay na hindi namin pa nagagawa dati. Ito ay naging magandang pagkakataon upang malaman ang aming mga hilig, naging malapit kami sa isa't isa at nakapagbigay ng mga ideya sa aming mga magulang upang mapaligiran ng positibong enerhiya ang aming tahanan.</p><p></p><p>Kapag nagsama-sama ang magkakapatid, hindi maiiwasang magkaroon ng mga di pagkakaintindihan. Ngunit, ito ay hindi dapat maging sanhi upang mawala ang aming pagkakaisa at pagmamahalan bilang magkakapatid. Sa pagharap namin sa mga ganitong sitwasyon, kailangan naming makinig sa isa't isa at magbigay ng respeto at pagpapahalaga sa bawat isa. Sa pamamagitan ng pagkakaroon ng open communication at pag-unawa sa bawat isa, nakayanan naming malagpasan ang mga di pagkakaunawaan at manatiling malapit bilang magkakapatid.</p><p></p><p>Sa kabuuan, ang bawat isa sa mga hamong ito ay naging magandang oportunidad upang malaman ang mga bagay na mahalaga sa buhay. Sa pagsisikap, pagtitiyaga, pakikipagkaisa at pagmamahal sa pamilya, nakayanan naming malampasan ang mga ham</p><br />

                            10. Activity 2. Read and analyze the paragraphs below. Then answer the following questions: In many ways, fiction and non-fiction are different from each other. Fiction, which includes novels, short stories, poems and plays, interprets human experience through the presentation of fictitious persons or situations and not through actual truths about particular events or abstract relations between ideas and reality. It presents lifelike images of people and events to embody truths about man and the human condition. On the other hand, nonfiction such as essays and biographies present or interpret facts, experiences, ideas or events, and make us appreciate the strangeness, the humor or the tragedy inherent in or connected with them. It discusses factual information and ideas to satisfy people's need for understanding and cognition. Individualistic and collectivist cultures vary in many ways. Members of an individualistic culture view their primary responsibility as helping themselves, whereas people in collective cultures feel loyalties and obligations to an in-group or one's extended family, community or organization. Individualistic cultures are also characterized by self-reliance and competition while members of a collective culture are more attentive to and concerned with the welfare of significant others. In handling disagreements, individualistic societies are relatively tolerant of conflicts and use a direct, solution - oriented approach. In contrast, members of collective cultures are less direct. Collective societies produce team players while individualistic ones are far more likely to produce and reward superstars. 1 - 2. What way of organizing a comparison and contrast is shown in paragraph 1? In paragraph 2? 3.-4. What transitional words or cohesive devices are used in paragraph1? What about in paragraph 2?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A paragraph is a group of related sentences that support one main idea. In general, paragraphs consist of three parts: the topic sentence, body sentences, and the concluding or the bridge sentence to the next paragraph or section. Paragraphs show where the subdivisions of a research paper begin and end and, thus, help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>kaya mo po yan <p> </p>I need somebody who can love me in my worsr<br />

Issues of conflict that are not resolved peacefully can lead to arguments and resentment.</p><p></p><p>It is normal to disagree with each other from time to time. Occasional conflict is part of family life. However, ongoing conflict can be stressful and damaging to relationships. Some people find it difficult to manage their feelings and become intentionally hurtful, aggressive or even violent.</p><p>Communicating in a positive way can help reduce conflict so that family members can reach a peaceful resolution.

                            19. argumentative essay about family conflict</h2><br />
                        In a family, conflict is never absent. Parents yelling at each other while children crying, no idea of what's going on. In a family, conflict like financial crisis, unfaithfulness of a spouse, miscommunication, is always one of the reasons of family conflicts. Parents that have a big family to support their children and paid in minimum wages and have a lot of debt to pay is really devastating to imagine.   but for me, I think having conflict in a family is normal. There's no way that in a healthy and loving family, there's no conflict happening. It also gives a lesson to a family that has undergone such a situation. It makes their family more strongly to each other and it reminds the family to be open to each other. <br />
