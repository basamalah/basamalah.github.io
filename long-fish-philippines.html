                            30. 1. When organisms die, the amount of carbon-14 in its system starts to decrease. Thecarbon-14 is about 5,600 years. If a piece of human bone was found to contain only1/3 of the carbon-14 it originally had, how long ago did the human die?2. A culture starts at 2,000 bacteria, and doubles every 70 minutes. How long will ittake the number of bacteria to reach 10,000?3. Under certain circumstances, a rumor spreads according to the equation1P(I) =where P(t) is the proportion of the population who has heard of therumor at time t days. How long will it take the rumor to reach 80% of the population?4. Suppose that a fish population t days from now can be modeled by an exponentialfunction P(t) = Aekt. Suppose that the fish population doubled in 90 days. By howmuch will the fish have multiplied from its initial number after 120 days?5. The dapdap tree in the Philippines is prone to wasp infestation. Suppose that the300percent P of defoliation is approximated by P=where x is the number3 +17eegg masses in thousands. If the percent of defoliation is 20%, approximately howmany egg masses are there?-0.0625irs​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. The ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 is the same in all living things. However, at the moment of death, the amount of carbon-14 begins to decrease because it is unstable, while the amount of carbon-12 remains constant in the sample. Half of the carbon-14 degrades every 5,730 years as indicated by its half-life.<p></p><p></p><p></p>PAKI BRAINLIEST ANSWER NAMAN POAT PAKI HEART :)#CARRY ON LEANING ;)<br />
