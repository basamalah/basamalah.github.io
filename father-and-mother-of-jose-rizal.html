                                            PART 3 Directions: The following statements are all directly taken from the article written by Atty. Josephus B. Jimenez entitled "Is Bonifacio a better hero than Jose Rizal?" and from the essay written by Arlene C. Padilla entitled "To be Both Safe and Educated". Analyze each of them and identify whether they show comparison or contrast, then encircle the transitional devices used. Example: Contrast_a. Nevertheless, the different learning modalities are and can be made available in our homes, making distance leaming more accessible than the traditional one. 1. Rizal was essentially a peaceful reformist while Bonifacio was a passionate warrior and revolutionary. 2. Bonifacio was like Rizal's characterization of Elias, the filibuster and rebel, and who did not believe that the oppressors would ever accept peaceful reforms. 3. In contrast, Rizal was the mother's spoiled favorite son, adored by his many sisters, and served by his father and elder brother Paciano, who opted to work as farmer to support Rizal's vast travels to Europe. 4. Classrooms nowadays, both in public and private Educational institutions, have computer laboratories for learning. 5. Some schools have television and speakers in most of their classrooms. Radios are available but not as common and useful as the television and speaker.​</a>
