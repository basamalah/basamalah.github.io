Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and Their Effects on Academic Performance Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concern that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (GD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction In general, IGO has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions, However, a study conducted by Samaha and Haw (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denoles a disparity on the result of academic performance between 1GD and mobile phone addiction Cyberbullying on the other hand, is also an ethical concem that has affected several adolescents and adults Previous studies on traditional buying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students. Both cyberbullying and moble game addiction (constructs) were neglected as causal factors for the students' academic performance (Favito, B. et al., 2018) 1. In what way can mobile game addiction affect one's physical and psychological health? 2. How many mobile games are being played around the world? 3. What would you advice other students to avoid online gaming addiction? 4. What are the indications that a person is a mobile game addict? 5. Why is it that smartphone addiction does not affect a student's academic performance while mobile gaming addiction does? 6. How does mobile game addiction affect a student's academic performance? 7. Who are the developers of the top five most popular mobile games? 8. Which between cyberbullying and mobile game addiction causes more damage to a student's academic performance? 9. When was the first mobile game developed? 10. What are mobile games?​</a>

Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and Thelr Effects on Academic Performance Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concem that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems. Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction. In general, IGD has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions. However, a study conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denotes a disparity on the result of academic performance between IGD and mobile phone addiction. Cyberbullying, on the other hand, is also an ethical concern that has affected several adolescents and adults. Previous studies on traditional bullying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students. Both cyberbullying and mobile game addiction (constructs) were neglected as causal factors for the students' academic performance. (Favito, B. et al., 2018) 1.

What would you advice other students to avoid online gaming addiction? 4. What are the indications that a person is a mobile game addict? _5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> The games have been found to have a positive impact on the academic performance of the students. It has been found that those who are addicted to video games have shown improvement on their academic performance. Also, those who are often exposed to video game have shown significant improvement in their video game playing skills. This has been shown to have a positive impact on their academics. (</p><p></p><p>Game playing has been found to have a positive impact on a number of different measures of academic performance, including grades, standardized test scores and even course grades. This is primarily due to the fact that video games require a significant amount of cognitive processing power and attention, which has the potential to improve the academic performance of the player. In fact, some studies have found that video game playing may even be able to slow down the rate of cognitive aging.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Internet as a source of information plays an important role in developing one's mind and life experiences by creating productive works in schools, offices, and even at home. Nowadays, this can be a person's most efficient strategic tool for enabling himself to take charge and cope with the fast growing technology.</p><p>The fact that people live in on informative lifestyle where everything is updated, internet became one of the necessities of human beings regardless of age or sex in today's society. However, the influence of this useful machine on youth is undeniably questionable. As to what Rock [1] said, all these technologies are very good at distracting people. In line with this development, online gaming was created to give entertainment to people.</p><p>Online gaming is one of the widely used leisure activities by many people. For some people it is said that playing video games has a number of reasons to be played, for it can be a stress reliever, challenge and competition, relaxation, enjoyment, social interaction, and even mentally escaping from the real world.</p><p>For most people, on-line gaming is one of the best past time that they acquire specially for teenagers, youngsters and students. According to Kuss &amp; Griffiths [2], teens who play online games are just having fun. They do not just actually play because of some sort of seriousness, but also because they just want to feel relief. During school hours, students tend to feel stressed due to loads of school works and through playing it will relive their stress.</p><p>It is undeniably questionable that playing online games provide them something that no one can give. According to some researches it is beneficial. It enables the mind of the players to be more active, especially those puzzle-based games. Furthermore, it helps the player to come up with decisions in tight situations, especially those adventure games that keep the players to be alert, active and strategic.</p><p>Students' learning takes place unexpectedly, but the inappropriate usage of playing online games also leads in some problems such as being distracted in school. Further, it is where the attention of the child were divided that even their health and social life is unknowingly affected.</p><p>Several studies in psychology have found out that increased time spent on the Internet can lead to negative impact on a person's ability to communicate appropriately face-to-face with friends, peers, family members including parents [3].</p><p>Studies revealed that the human brain is easy to destruct and one of the reasons is using technology. The education system tends to go with the flow with this constant change in the society in order to get things relevant with the generations today.</p><p>The researchers felt the need to determine the impact of online gaming to students' academic performance and their social behavior. The purpose of this study is to find out the implications of on-line gaming to the academic performance and social behavior of the students.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>bala ka jan.</p><p></p><br />

                            6. write a 500 word synthesis and summary of EFFECT OF ADDICTION TO ONLINE GAMES TO STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Addiction to online games is a growing problem among students that can have negative effects on their academic performance. With the rise of technology and easy access to online games, students are becoming increasingly addicted to these games, which can lead to poor grades, lack of motivation, and even drop out of school. This essay will examine the effects of addiction to online games on student academic performance and how it can be prevented or managed.</p><p></p><p>The addiction to online games can have a significant impact on student academic performance. Studies have shown that students who spend a lot of time playing online games tend to have lower grades, reduced motivation, and higher rates of absenteeism. These students often neglect their studies and fail to meet academic expectations. The problem of addiction to online games is also associated with psychological and social issues, such as depression, anxiety, and social isolation, which can further impact academic performance.</p><p></p><p>The negative effects of addiction to online games on student academic performance can be mitigated through various interventions. One approach is to limit students' access to online games and monitor their use. Schools and parents can work together to develop strategies for reducing the amount of time students spend on online games, such as setting limits on the amount of time students can spend on games per day or week. Additionally, schools can offer support services to students struggling with addiction to online games, such as counseling, education, and alternative activities to help them build more positive and productive habits.</p><p></p><p>Another approach is to incorporate online games into the learning process, such as using educational games to teach important concepts and skills. This approach can help students see the value of online games beyond mere entertainment and can help them develop a more positive attitude towards learning. By incorporating online games into the curriculum, schools can also help students build the skills necessary to succeed in a digital world, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration.</p><p></p><p>Schools and parents can work together to create a supportive environment for students struggling with addiction to online games. This includes providing emotional support, setting achievable goals, and celebrating successes. By creating a supportive environment, students can feel more motivated and empowered to overcome their addiction to online games and improve their academic performance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Summary:<br />Online gaming has become a popular leisure activity among students, but its negative effects on academic performance have been a concern for educators and parents. This paper aims to summarize and synthesize recent research on the impact of addiction to online games on students' academic performance. The paper found that addiction to online games is associated with a decline in academic performance, as students become distracted, experience sleep deprivation, and become disengaged from their academic responsibilities. Additionally, addiction to online games can also lead to social isolation and interpersonal conflicts, further impacting academic performance.<br /><br />Synthesis:<br />A number of studies have been conducted on the effects of addiction to online games on students' academic performance, with many highlighting the negative consequences. For example, a study conducted by Li and colleagues (2020) found that addiction to online games was associated with poor academic performance and lower grades. The study involved 369 students and found that those who reported higher levels of addiction to online games had lower GPA scores than their peers who did not play games excessively.<br /><br />Similarly, a study by Chiu and colleagues (2017) found that addiction to online games was negatively correlated with academic achievement. The study involved 2,484 high school students and found that those who reported higher levels of addiction to online games were more likely to have lower grades and lower academic aspirations.<br /><br />One of the main reasons for the negative impact of addiction to online games on academic performance is that it can lead to distraction and procrastination. When students become addicted to online games, they may spend more time playing than studying, leading to poor time management and reduced academic engagement. A study by Pontes and Griffiths (2016) found that online gaming addiction was associated with decreased academic engagement and lower academic performance, as students spent more time gaming and less time studying.<br /><br />In addition, addiction to online games can lead to sleep deprivation, which can further impact academic performance. A study by Khazaal and colleagues (2016) found that online gaming addiction was associated with poor sleep quality and shorter sleep duration, which in turn can lead to decreased cognitive functioning and impaired academic performance.<br /><br />Moreover, addiction to online games can lead to social isolation and interpersonal conflicts, further impacting academic performance. Students who become addicted to online games may withdraw from social activities and relationships, which can impact their social and emotional development. Additionally, students who become addicted to online games may experience interpersonal conflicts with peers and family members, which can cause stress and further impact academic performance.<br /><br />In conclusion, addiction to online games can have a negative impact on students' academic performance. Studies have shown that addiction to online games is associated with distraction, procrastination, sleep deprivation, social isolation, and interpersonal conflicts, all of which can lead to poor academic performance. Educators and parents need to be aware of the negative consequences of addiction to online games and take steps to help students balance their leisure activities with their academic responsibilities. This may involve setting limits on screen time, encouraging physical activity and social engagement, and providing support for students who may be struggling with addiction. By taking a proactive approach, educators and parents can help students achieve their academic goals and develop healthy habits for the future.<br />

Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and Thelr Effects on Academic Performance Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concem that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems. Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction. In general, IGD has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions. However, a study conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denotes a disparity on the result of academic performance between IGD and mobile phone addiction. Cyberbullying, on the other hand, is also an ethical concern that has affected several adolescents and adults. Previous studies on traditional bullying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students. Both cyberbullying and mobile game addiction (constructs) were neglected as causal factors for the students' academic performance. (Favito, B. et al., 2018) 1.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I apologize, but I cannot answer the research questions without conducting the study. However, I can provide some insights on how to approach the research questions.</p><p></p><p>1. To determine the level of awareness of PBNHS senior high school students regarding the negative effects of online games, you can conduct a survey or questionnaire that asks students about their knowledge of the potential negative effects of online games. You can also ask them about their personal experiences with online games and whether they have observed any negative effects on themselves or others.</p><p></p><p>2. To investigate how playing mobile games affects the academic performance of Grade 11 GAS students in PBNHS, you can collect data on the students' academic performance (e.g., grades, test scores) and compare it to their self-reported frequency and duration of mobile game use. You can also ask the students' teachers for their observations on the students' academic performance and behavior in class.</p><p></p><p>3. To identify the common reasons why students engage in playing mobile games, you can conduct interviews or focus groups with students and ask them about their motivations for playing mobile games. You can also ask them about the types of games they play and how often they play them.</p><p></p><p>4. To propose possible ways to enhance students' teamwork and improve their activeness in school, you can review the literature on effective strategies for promoting teamwork and active participation in the classroom. You can also gather input from teachers and students on what they believe would be effective strategies for promoting these behaviors.</p><p></p><p>5. To provide recommendations to students and parents on managing their time spent on mobile games to minimize the negative effects on academic performance, you can review the literature on effective strategies for managing screen time and provide recommendations based on this research.</p><br />
