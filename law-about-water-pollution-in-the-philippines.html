                                            MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</a>

                            4. MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</h2><br />
