                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This ability to empathise facilitates better personal and professional relationships. When we are more self-aware we are better at understanding ourselves. We are then able to identify changes we want to make and recognise our strengths so we can build on them. Self-awareness is often a first step to goal setting</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p> When we have high internal self-awareness, we understand how we affect the environment and those around us. High internal self-awareness makes us happier and more satisfied. It also helps to combat anxiety, stress, and depression.</p><p></p><p>External self-awareness has more to do with being aware of how other people see us. This includes how others see our strengths, weaknesses, values, passions, and aspirations. When a person has high external self-awareness, they are better at seeing other people’s perspectives and showing empathy. This greatly increases their effectiveness in leadership positions because this practice strengthens relationships.</p><p></p><p>It’s easy to see how high self-awareness in both areas can benefit you in the workplace. When you are aware of your own values and passions you better align your skills with them. Additionally, the ability to see yourself accurately allows you to detect and fix mistakes more quickly. You can also maintain better working relationships with colleges through empathy.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>I believe I can better understand myself, my meaning, and the purpose of my existence by employing the philosophical perspective of existentialism. </p><p></p><p>Jean Paul Sartre, one of the prominent figures in the rise of existentialism, assert that we are born in this world without meaning and purpose. We are a colorless substance. It is really up to us to put meaning and color to our existence. </p><p>Although most people would argue that we are born with a purpose, and that the purpose of our lives is to glorify and serve our creator. Nevertheless, existentialist philosophers don't buy this proposition. They believe that man is free, and our freedom is one our greatest tool that can lead us to self-actualization. </p><p>If you're bothered understanding yourself, knowing your meaning and purpose, bear in mind these words from Sarte, "existence precedes essence".

                        <p></p><p>One basic way we use the word “good” is to express moral approval. So when we say someone is living well or that they have lived a good life, we may simply mean that they are a good person, someone who is courageous, honest, trustworthy, kind, selfless, generous, helpful, loyal, principled, and so on.</p><p></p><p>They possess and practice many of the most important virtues. And they don’t spend all their time merely pursuing their own pleasure; they devote a certain amount of time to activities that benefit others, perhaps through their engagement with family and friends, or through their work, or through various voluntary activities.</p><p></p><p>This moral conception of the good life has had plenty of champions. Socrates and Plato both gave absolute priority to being a virtuous person over all other supposedly good things such as pleasure, wealth, or power.</p><p></p><p>In Plato’s dialogue Gorgias, Socrates takes this position to an extreme. He argues that it is much better to suffer wrong than to do it; that a good man who has his eyes gouged out and is tortured to death is more fortunate than a corrupt person who has used wealth and power dishonorably.</p><p></p><p>In his masterpiece, the Republic, Plato develops this argument in greater detail. The morally good person, he claims, enjoys a sort of inner harmony, whereas the wicked person, no matter how rich and powerful he may be or how many pleasure he enjoys, is disharmonious, fundamentally at odds with himself and the world.</p><p></p><p>It is worth noting, though, that in both the Gorgias and the Republic, Plato bolsters his argument with a speculative account of an afterlife in which virtuous people are rewarded and wicked people are punished.</p><p></p><p>Many religions also conceive of the good life in moral terms as a life lived according to God’s laws. A person who lives this way—obeying the commandments and performing the proper rituals—is pious. And in most religions, such piety will be rewarded. Obviously, many people do not receive their reward in this life.</p><p></p><p>But devout believers are confident that their piety will not be in vain. Christian martyrs went singing to their deaths confident that they would soon be in heaven. Hindus expect that the law of karma will ensure that their good deeds and intentions will be rewarded, while evil actions and desires will be punished, either in this life or in future lives.</p><br />

He has arguably been dubbed as the father of modern philosophy with special emphasis on the Western school of thought (Smith 1).</p><p></p><p>As a result, his pieces of writing remain key reference materials for scholars across the global plane. For example, meditations continue serving as principal text books in philosophy departments of most universities in the world today. His contribution in mathematics set unbeaten record with his efforts being widely applied in calculus and geometry. In development of natural sciences, his input cannot go unnoticed.</p><p> He believed that philosophy was a mega entity that encompassed all aspects of knowledge expressed through it. Although most of the works and thoughts have been widely considered, there has been a strong emphasis on Meditations on First Philosophy.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The director and playwright of “Dekada ’70”, Pat Valera, envisioned that his adaptation of Lualhati Bautista’s Palanca award-winning book would be watched and understood by young people.  Valera and some of the original cast members, Stella Cañete-Mendoza (Amanda Bartolome), Jon Abella (Jules Bartolome) and Abe Autea’s (Bingo Bartolome), spoke with INQUIRER.net last Saturday, Feb. 22, and voiced out their insights about the play, some of which touch on its relevance to the young.  The production invites its audience from all walks of life, regardless of age, gender, social status, and even political alignment, to take a seat at the Doreen Black Box Theater in Arete, to awaken their political consciousness, especially if it has already gone into a deep slumber.
</p><p></p><p>The play, now on its third run, was initially staged in 2018 as Valera’s thesis production requirement at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he graduated in 2019.  
Valera revealed that he first decided to adapt Bautista’s play after the news about former President Ferdinand Marcos’ burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani rocked the nation and gave rise to protests. “The art and the theater should respond to this,” Valera said, referring to the burial of Marcos in a cemetery supposedly for heroes. Since then, the play’s concerns have “compounded” to tackle more issues such as the suppression of press freedom and “the need for memory to continue.”
</p><p>
</p><p>
True to the source
</p><p>
Bautista’s novel was told through the perspective of Amanda Bartolome, a housewife and a mother of five boys, as their family lived through the 1970s, before and during the time when Marcos declared Martial Law.
</p><p>While Amanda’s five boys, Jules (Julian Jr.), Gani (Isagani), Em (Emmanuel), Jason, and Bingo (Benjamin) grew up and started forming their own beliefs in their journey towards becoming “men of life,” Amanda also started her own journey towards liberation. From a life supposedly centered around “a man’s world,” step-by-step Amanda freed her mind from the confines of her middle-class lifestyle. The musical transforms Bautista’s depiction of the decade into a play that also highlights the plight of the masses surrounding the Bartolome family. The musical’s ensemble echoes the political unrest of the period through its songs and its portrayal of political prisoners during the 1970s, which Valera assured was backed by extensive research.
</p><p>
</p><p>The play’s third run began on Feb. 21 and is extended until March 14. The bare rectangular theater which houses “Dekada ’70” booms with life and music as the characters perform their well-choreographed song-and-dance numbers, and deliver their heart-wrenching dialogue. Even the comedic banter between the Bartolome boys drives the audience into waves of laughter and intense emotion.  “Dekada ’70” transitions from one scene to another, often with compelling ballads or upbeat protest hymns, written by Valera and the play’s musical director Matthew Chang.  When Valera was asked why the novel was transformed into a musical, he explained that the initial plan was to make a play with music. Valera, later on, realized the undeniable power of musicals, which led the team to want “to bring out the emotion” in the story. Valera cited that one of their inspirations for turning the play into a musical was a fellow artist, film director Pepe Diokno, who said, “One day we will sing our own songs.”  Diokno’s words became the play’s framework when they were writing the script, which compelled them to “sing their own songs as well.”  One of the play’s most powerful songs, “Bayan, Bayan, Bayan Ko” was performed by the play’s ensemble. The upbeat song, filled with heavy bass lines, electric guitar riffs, rapid beats, and multi-layered vocals, invites people to take a stand and continue fighting.  “Tao, bayan/ Kailan maninindigan?” the ensemble repeatedly sings.  Despite acknowledging the songs as “larger than life,” Valera clarified they had to tread this line carefully to avoid making a “spectacle out of history.”  “We must find our own truth on how we sing it, hanging saan ‘Yung (what are the limits of the) spectacle, per se,” Valera stated. “To be objective about it as well.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Understanding the self is a complex and multifaceted process that can take a lifetime to fully comprehend. At its core, understanding the self involves gaining insight into one's own thoughts, feelings, motivations, and behaviors. This process can be aided by engaging in introspection, self-reflection, and therapy, among other things.</p><p></p><p>One of the key components of understanding the self is the ability to recognize and understand one's own emotions. Emotions are a natural and integral part of the human experience, and they play a vital role in how we perceive and navigate the world around us. By understanding our own emotions, we can gain insight into our own thoughts and behaviors, and we can better understand why we react to certain situations in the way that we do.</p><p></p><p>Another crucial aspect of understanding the self is the ability to understand and manage our own thoughts. Our thoughts are constantly shaping our perceptions of the world and our own experiences, and they can have a powerful influence on our emotions and behaviors. By gaining insight into our own thought processes, we can better understand why we think the way that we do, and we can learn to identify and challenge any negative or distorted thoughts that may be holding us back.</p><p></p><p>In addition to gaining insight into our own emotions and thoughts, understanding the self also involves developing a sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance. This means being able to recognize and accept our own strengths and weaknesses, as well as our own unique experiences and perspectives. By embracing ourselves fully and without judgment, we can begin to build a strong foundation of self-confidence and self-esteem.</p><p></p><p>Overall, understanding the self is a lifelong process that requires effort, self-reflection, and a willingness to learn and grow. By gaining insight into our own emotions, thoughts, and experiences, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, and we can begin to live more authentic and fulfilling lives.</p><br />

                        <p> For me Sexual self-concept refers to the totality of oneself as a sexual being, including positive and negative concepts and feelings. According to theorists, sexual self-concept is described well along three dimensions (Snell &amp; Papini, 1989): sexual self-esteem, sexual depression, and sexual preoccupation.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>well, it depends on your religion. For example, if you believe in Jesus then you will believe that if you die, you will end up in one of these three places based on the things that you've done when you were still alive; heaven, hell, and purgatory. Some others beliefs in their religion that if they died, and they have a heavy sin, they have no choice but to reincarnate over and over again until they do only good deeds in their next life without having the memory of their past life. So in conclusion, it depends on ones religion. But for me, I'm Catholic and I do believe in Jesus which is why, the only three I will end up with when I died is heaven, hell, and purgatory.<p></p>sana po nakatulong! pa brainliest po sana☺️<br />
