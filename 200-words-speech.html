After all, we only have one planet to live on!</p><p></p><p>There are a lot of things we can do to help the environment, and I'm going to talk about some of them today.</p><p></p><p>First of all, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels releases harmful gases into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change. There are many alternative energy sources that we can use instead, such as solar and wind power.</p><p></p><p>We can  also reduce our waste. Every year, millions of tons of waste are sent to landfill sites. This waste takes up valuable space, and it can pollute the environment. There are many ways to reduce our waste, such as recycling and composting.</p><p></p><p>Finally, we can protect our wildlife. Habitat loss is a major problem for many species of animals, and it's often caused by human activity. By preserving natural habitats, we can help to protect our wildlife.</p><p></p><p>These are just a few of the things we can do to help the environment.

                        Millennials are found to be lazy and narcissistic. They expect everything to be handed down to them as if they are entitled to it. Older generations picture us sitting on a couch with our feet up in the air, starring like a zombie into our screens on our phones, while taking selfies every five minutes, demanding our boss to give us a raise. If only the people who judge us knew how hard we really have it in today’s world. Liz Zarka’s 2013 article entitled “Generation Me: The Millennial Generation’s Obsession with Being Unique”, from The Daily Clog,states her beliefs that Millennials are more focused on ourselves verses helping our planet. She assumes we are self-absorbed, conceded, and only care about fame and do not care about changing the way people see us. However, I believe the millennials are an admirable generation because we can multitask, we see the value in higher education, and we are aspirational.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I think distance learning has an advantage and disadvantage to students. Let's prioritize the advantage, children can save because they only study at home and you know they are safe, and disadvantage of distance learning is difficult for children to learn and difficult to adjust because of their habit. there are students who can easily get a lesson and there are students who have difficulty getting a lesson. Students in the classroom sometimes do not understand their lesson how else if they are the only ones who will teach their lesson too distance learning is hassle and expensive because there is a possibility that they will not learn what they are doing. there are also barriers to their study when they are at home they get a lot of attention so they will be distracted and distracted from their studies.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#Carryonlearning</p><br />

Authentication of a student’s identity is especially difficult in e-learning because the institution may never have direct contact with the student. Increasingly, the need to address this challenge is being mandated by certification bodies, companies whose employees must complete academic requirements, and government regulators. I Drive Safely and Language Testing International are two such companies using SV to help them address the authentication challenges and requirements</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Hello! </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Explanations are an integral part of communication and play a vital role in shaping our understanding of the world. Whether it is at work, school, or in our personal lives, the ability to effectively explain ideas and concepts is a critical skill that can help us succeed and thrive.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To make an explanation, one must begin by clearly understanding the topic being discussed. This means doing the necessary research, gathering all relevant information, and organizing it in a way that makes sense. It is also important to consider the audience and tailor the explanation to their level of understanding. One should avoid using technical jargon or complex language that may confuse the listener.</p><p></p><p></p><p>When making an explanation, it is also important to be concise and direct. Long-winded explanations can be overwhelming and may cause the listener to lose interest. It is better to focus on the most important points and provide examples or analogies to help illustrate the concept being discussed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In addition to being clear and concise, a good explanation should also be engaging and interactive. This can be achieved by asking questions, encouraging feedback, and incorporating visual aids such as diagrams or videos.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Finally, a good explanation should leave the listener with a clear understanding of the topic and, ideally, inspire them to continue learning and exploring. By taking the time to craft a well-thought-out explanation, we can share knowledge and ideas in a way that is both effective and engaging.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, making explanations is a fundamental skill that can have a significant impact on our personal and professional lives. By taking the time to understand our audience, being clear and concise, and engaging our listeners, we can make effective explanations that inspire learning and facilitate understanding. </p><br />

                        <p>love is more than anything </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Okeh!</p><p>Love makes you feel better. Even if you are in perfect health, having a loving person in your life makes it sweeter. If you are dealing with some physical issues, love can really give you what you need to get better. The knowledge that you are cared for makes you more comfortable and allows you to heal faster. Love, no matter what form it comes in, helps people incorporate safer behaviors into their everyday lives, reduces anxiety (worry, nervousness), and lowers the chance of developing depression or another form of mental illness. and changes you to a better person. like when you have a filthy behavior, Love can change your attitude but sometimes love can also cause pain to yourself. Love can give us a physical reaction. A quickened heart rate, butterflies in our stomachs, dilated pupils, sweaty palms, a hard time finding words, the instinctive urge to physically touch are just a few ways in which love can physically affect us. </p><p>Sex as a physical act of love can reap many benefits. It can lower blood pressure, increase bladder control for women, reduce stress, improve sleep, and boost the immune system. These positive physical effects from sex can spill over into many other aspects of life, from parenting to work to friendships and beyond. </p><p>A stable and healthy physical relationship with another person boosts emotional and mental wellbeing as well.Many studies have shown that a healthy and supportive relationship—be it romantic, familial, friendship, or otherwise—can be linked to higher self-esteem, increased sense of self-worth, and improved self-confidence. Love, no matter what form it comes in, helps people incorporate safer behaviors into their everyday lives, reduces anxiety (worry, nervousness), and lowers the chance of developing depression or another form of mental illness.</p><p>Love Changes Your Brain Chemistry</p><p>Love changes your brain chemistry temporarily. Those butterflies fluttering in your stomach can be contributed to brain chemicals. The exciting feeling of your heart skipping a beat or leaping out of your chest can also be attributed to a release in brain chemicals. Several brain chemicals and hormones can be attributed to love, but two specifically stand out: dopamine and oxytocin. </p><p>Dopamine is a brain chemical that releases when you see or feel something pleasurable. It makes you want more of it. Dopamine is what can make love and your significant other seem addicting. It is the same brain chemical that perpetuates additions like gambling, substance abuse, etc. When meeting a new special someone you may feel like you are on a high and want more and more of that person.</p><p>Oxytocin, a hormone that calms and helps couples bond, helps promote intimacy between two people. It’s also referred to as the “cuddle hormone.” This hormone is also released when playing with or petting your dog.</p><p>Often times these changes in brain chemistry and hormones are only temporary. Once the new special someone in your life becomes the new normal, we adjust back to our normal brain chemistry.</p><p>Falling Out of Love Hurts</p><p>When someone we love hurts us or is no longer part of our lives for one reason or another, our health can take a hit. Physical and emotional feelings use the same pain centers and our brain uses the same neurological pathways to feel those feelings.</p><p>You may have heard of broken heart syndrome, but you may not realize it is a real medical condition that can negatively affect your physical, emotional, and mental health. Broken heart syndrome is also referred to as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, in which the heart temporarily enlarges ― a serious and sometimes fatal condition. The condition can occur when going through a breakup or divorce, grieving for a seriously injured or departed loved one, or during a time of extreme stress. It’s speculated that broken heart syndrome is the cause when loved ones die within a short time of one another, such as spouses dying hours or days a part ― or more recently, actress Debbie Reynolds passing away just a day after her daughter,</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I think its over 200 hundred words now??</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Distance learning involves delivery of educational services to students who are not physically present at the educational institution. It is the fastest-growing segment of education, particularly in higher education and adult education. Today’s distance education is also a far cry from the mailed “correspondence courses” offered by Isaac Pitman more than 150 years ago. It uses television, radio, CD-ROM, mobile devices, the Internet, and speech technologies.   This is the first of two columns describing ways in which providers of distance-learning services are incorporating speech into their offerings. It describes the use of speaker verification (SV) to verify that the person taking a course is the student who is supposed to be taking it, and that the person taking an examination is the registered student.  Authentication of a student’s identity is especially difficult in e-learning because the institution may never have direct contact with the student. Increasingly, the need to address this challenge is being mandated by certification bodies, companies whose employees must complete academic requirements, and government regulators. I Drive Safely and Language Testing International are two such companies using SV to help them address the authentication challenges and requirements. <p></p>HOPEFULLY IT HELPS<br />

Due to being away from our friends family or even other people we barely know our mental health is crippling. The moment we thought that our school's suspended for a whole week we didn't know everything's gonna fall down. Most teens would lock their self in their room thinking, spacing out "Would everything be okay?" "What happens next?" crying every night. A notification pops up 'You got 14 missing assignments'. A mental breakdown after it saying "When will the pain go away?". Most cuts or starve theirselves. Pain, pain go away . But it never do it never will.

In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.</p><p>Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.</p><p>Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us. Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.</p><p>That being said, we'd now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors from across the globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of COVID-19 patients</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps you</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Teaching oral communication in schools is becoming more infrequent. The importance of oral communication should be no different than the necessity of math, reading, or writing. Oral communication by definition is communication by word of mouth. Children must be confident in their speaking abilities because many careers require this skill. Schools must reconsider how important it is to promote oral communication, examine why it has been limited in schools, and learn how to teach it more effectively. Oral communication skills are a necessity that every child will need as an adult.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Oral communication is an important skill because it promotes leadership and confidence. When children are confident in their abilities they will succeed academically and socially. It is important for students to generate their own ideas using outside references in the community (Joseph and Efron, pg 5-6). Oftentimes some students have trouble making friends. If they can learn to be more confident in their speaking abilities they will be more likely to approach their peers. On the other hand, when students feel comfortable expressing their ideas in front of people they will most likely contribute more to class discussions. Teachers always have difficulty with getting their students to participate constructively, so if the teacher spends more time teaching their students how to talk and respond coherently children will be more likely to contribute.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Good day everyone,</p><p></p><p>Today, I want to talk to you about the art of making explanations in the English language. Explaining a topic or concept is a crucial skill in both academic and professional settings. Effective explanations not only help convey information clearly but also promote better understanding and learning.</p><p></p><p>To make a good explanation, it is important to start by understanding the topic or concept thoroughly. This requires research, analysis, and a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Once you have a good grasp of the topic, organize your thoughts and create a structured outline of the explanation.</p><p></p><p>Next, focus on using clear and concise language. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may confuse your audience. Instead, use simple and easy-to-understand words that are appropriate for the audience you are addressing.</p><p></p><p>Another important aspect of making explanations is the use of examples. Examples help to illustrate complex concepts in a way that is relatable and easier to understand. Incorporating relevant examples into your explanation can help your audience visualize the topic and relate it to their own experiences.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, it is important to be patient and receptive to feedback. Making explanations is a process that requires continuous improvement. Be open to feedback and suggestions from others, and use them to improve your future explanations.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, making explanations is a critical skill in both academic and professional settings. By focusing on understanding the topic, using clear language, incorporating relevant examples, and being receptive to feedback, you can master the art of making explanations and become an effective communicator. Thank you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Covid-19 crisis is unique in several respects. This devastating recession does not have an economic origin, will dance largely to the tune of non-economic factors, and is truly global. The policy response has been equally unique, in terms of speed, size and scope, eliciting an unprecedented concerted effort combining monetary, fiscal and prudential policies. This has contained the fallout. At the time of writing, financial markets have rebounded to the point of looking exuberant, but it all feels more like a truce than a peace treaty. The crisis is transitioning from the liquidity to the solvency phase in a context of limited and shrinking room for policy manoeuvre. All this raises difficult near- and longer-term challenges. Rebuilding policy buffers in all policy areas is likely to be the policy challenge of the decade ahead.</p><p><strong>explanation</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>thanks</strong><strong> </strong><strong>me</strong><strong> </strong><strong>later</strong><strong> </strong><strong>godbless</strong><strong>,</strong><strong>keepsafe</strong><strong> </strong><strong>all</strong><strong>!</strong></p><br />

                            30. write a 150-200 word speech about bullying and what bullying can do to students​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying can happen at any stage of life, such as school bullying, College bullying, Workplace bullying, Public Place bullying, etc. Many times not only the other persons but the family members or parents also unknowingly bully an individual by making constant discouraging remarks. Hence the victim gradually starts losing his/her self-esteem, and may also suffer from psychological disorders.</p><p></p><p>A UNESCO report says that 32% of students are bullied at schools worldwide. In our country as well, bullying is becoming quite common. Instead, bullying is becoming a major problem worldwide. It has been noted that physical bullying is prevalent amongst boys and psychological bullying is prevalent amongst girls.</p><br />
