Allowing access to the virtual world with unlimited possibilities, computer games compulsively attract many people. In fact, they have become an integral part of human society (Demirbileka&amp; Tamer. 2010). There are also others that have decreased academic performance in relation to involvement in playing video games. Andersons and Dili (2007) studied video games and aggression and suggested that not only does gaming have impact on perfomance directly, but it also triggers a higher level of aggression, which is often linked to problems in school and decreased academic performance Main Point “为 2 points​</a>

Online games can be very harmful if you won't like to attend extracurricular activities other than gaming You are more focused on playing them than attending different activities in school and in other occasions As an effect, sometimes, attending your classes is very difficult for you to do because once playing starts, it will be very hard to leave the game. As you play online games, your body will suffer because of not eating properly and not sleeping at the right time. So, play online games in moderation (Online games Thumbs up or Flop?

First e-sports college degree in the Philippines now in the works By Vince Ferreras, CNN Philippines Metro Manila — Online gaming might not be an after-school pastime anymore in the future as the first degree program in electronic sports (esports) in the country is being developed. The Lyceum of the Philippines University (LPU) and esports and gaming agency Tier One Entertainment collaborated to develop the curriculum of the four-year degree on Bachelor of Science in ESports. It will be offered this coming school year once approved by the Commission on Higher Education. “We will be passing the curriculum to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on March this year. If this goes well, we might have a full course available by 2020,” said Tier One Entertainment in a post on social media. The gaming agency’s chief executive officer Tryke Gutierrez said that the new degree program will have two tracks namely: game development and esports management. However, he did not disclose yet the subjects under the program. “The goal has always been to create more opportunities for gamers in Asia. If this curriculum gets approved, we won't just be providing post career opportunities for gaming, but we will have a new generation of graduates ready to work in the esports industry,” said Gutierrez in an online post.

Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and Thelr Effects on Academic Performance Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concem that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems. Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction. In general, IGD has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions. However, a study conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denotes a disparity on the result of academic performance between IGD and mobile phone addiction. Cyberbullying, on the other hand, is also an ethical concern that has affected several adolescents and adults. Previous studies on traditional bullying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students.

First e-sports college degree in the Philippines now in the works By Vince Ferreras, CNN Philippines Metro Manila — Online gaming might not be an after-school pastime anymore in the future as the first degree program in electronic sports (esports) in the country is being developed. The Lyceum of the Philippines University (LPU) and esports and gaming agency Tier One Entertainment collaborated to develop the curriculum of the four-year degree on Bachelor of Science in ESports. It will be offered this coming school year once approved by the Commission on Higher Education. “We will be passing the curriculum to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) on March this year. If this goes well, we might have a full course available by 2020,” said Tier One Entertainment in a post on social media. The gaming agency’s chief executive officer Tryke Gutierrez said that the new degree program will have two tracks namely: game development and esports management. However, he did not disclose yet the subjects under the program. “The goal has always been to create more opportunities for gamers in Asia. If this curriculum gets approved, we won't just be providing post career opportunities for gaming, but we will have a new generation of graduates ready to work in the esports industry,” said Gutierrez in an online post.

Mobile Game Addiction, Cyberbullying, and Thelr Effects on Academic Performance Mobile gaming addiction is a growing concem that increases the user's risk for physical and psychological health problems. Video game addiction is part of the so-called Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and is often associated with Gambling Addiction. In general, IGD has been linked to a poorer academic performance of students in educational institutions. However, a study conducted by Samaha and Hawi (2016) revealed that there is no relationship between smartphone addiction risk and academic performance. This denotes a disparity on the result of academic performance between IGD and mobile phone addiction. Cyberbullying, on the other hand, is also an ethical concern that has affected several adolescents and adults. Previous studies on traditional bullying and cyberbullying revealed that both can greatly impact school performance of students among others. As far as the present study is concerned, no studies have been conducted which determines whether mobile game addiction and cyberbullying are causal factors for the academic performance of students. Both cyberbullying and mobile game addiction (constructs) were neglected as causal factors for the students' academic performance. (Favito, B. et al., 2018) 1.
