Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

3. Mango float is a Filipino icebox cake dessert made with layers of graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ripe mangoes. It is a modern variant of the traditional Filipino crema de fruta cake. Here are the steps to follow to prepare it. Prepare a rectangular glass dish with or without a lid. In a bowl, whisk Nestle cream until smooth. Add the condensed and evaporated milk. Whisk until well combined. Using a ladle, place a small amount of the milk mixture into the bottom of the dish, then place a layer of Graham crackers and top with the sliced mangoes. Ladle a mixture again, slowly pours over the crackers and the mangoes, making sure it covers all of the Graham crackers. Repeat by placing layers of crackers, mangoes, and milk mixture. Top off with Graham crumbs (or just crushed some Graham crackers). Cover and freeze overnight. Serve and enjoy!

He began his early education at home with his mother as his first teacher and continued in Biñan, Laguna. He entered a Jesuit-run Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a bachelor’s degree with the highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas but had to stop because he felt that the Filipino students were being discriminated against by their Dominican tutors. He went to Madrid at Universidad Central de Madrid and in 1885 at the age of 24; he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters with a grade of “Excellent.”

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *

                            18. 1. Junk Food is very harmful that is slowly eating away the health of the present generation. The term itself denotes how dangerous it is for our bodies. Most importantly, it tastes so good that people consume it daily. However, not much awareness is spread about the harmful effects of junk food. The problem is more serious than you think. Various studies show that junk food impacts our health negatively. They contain higher levels of calories, fats, and sugar. On the contrary, they have very low amounts of healthy nutrients and lack dietary fibers. Parents must discourage their children from consuming junk food because of the ill effects it has on one’s health.

2. A private school is autonomous and generates its own funding through various sources like student tuition, private grants, and endowments. A public school is government-funded and all students attend free of cost. Because of funding from several sources, private schools may teach above and beyond the standard curriculum, may cater to a specific kind of students (gifted, special needs, specific religion/language), or have an alternative curriculum like art, drama, technology, etc. Public schools have to adhere to the curriculum charted out by the district, and cannot deny admission to any child within the residential school zone. There are several preconceived notions regarding private and public schools. Private schools are often assumed to be very expensive, elitist and a better bet for admission to good colleges. Public schools are often thought of as shoddy, less disciplined, and low-grade curriculum. This comparison offers a fair insight into both schools for parents to make an informed decision.

3. Mango float is a Filipino icebox cake dessert made with layers of graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ripe mangoes. It is a modern variant of the traditional Filipino crema de fruta cake. Here are the steps to follow to prepare it. Prepare a rectangular glass dish with or without a lid. In a bowl, whisk Nestle cream until smooth. Add the condensed and evaporated milk. Whisk until well combined. Using a ladle, place a small amount of the milk mixture into the bottom of the dish, then place a layer of Graham crackers and top with the sliced mangoes. Ladle a mixture again, slowly pours over the crackers and the mangoes, making sure it covers all of the Graham crackers. Repeat by placing layers of crackers, mangoes, and milk mixture. Top off with Graham crumbs (or just crushed some Graham crackers). Cover and freeze overnight. Serve and enjoy!

He entered a Jesuit-run Ateneo Municipal de Manila in 1872 and obtained a bachelor’s degree with the highest honors in 1876. He studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas but had to stop because he felt that the Filipino students were being discriminated against by their Dominican tutors. He went to Madrid at Universidad Central de Madrid and in 1885 at the age of 24; he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters with a grade of “Excellent.”

5. The schools today and in the past are similar in a few ways and different in some aspects. Both have a learning room, a teacher, and books. However, the classrooms in the past are considered concrete structures where learning should take place. On the other hand, classrooms today utilize technology like LCD projectors, laptops, and other gadgets. Another is that lesson plans in the past were from print materials while lessons of today are from-books and other online platforms. No matter how alike and different the schools in the past and today are, what matters most is how effective learning takes place. *
