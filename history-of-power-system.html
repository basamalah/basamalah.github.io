                                            Direction: 
Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 500-1,000 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output. __5. In 1867, the French physicist Alexandre E. Becquerel who had investigated the phenomena of fluorescence. __6. American Peter Cooper Hewitt patented the first mercury vapor lamp in 1910. __7. A fluorescent light is a type of electric lamp that excites mercury vapor to create luminescence. __8. Marty Goodman in his History of Electric Lighting cites Hewitt as inventing the first enclosed arc-type lamp using metal vapor in 1910.__9. In 1984,edmund germer created a high-pressure arc lamp that could handle a lot more power in a smaller space.__10. Hewitt's low-pressure mercury arc lamp put off a large amount of ultraviolet light.​</a>

                            7. Direction: 
Below is a sample definition of democracy by Saqueton and Uychoco (2016). Read the text then fill out the table that follows. 
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally – either directly or through elected representatives – in the proposal, development, and creation of laws.
It encompasses social, economic, and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. 
The term originates from the Greek “demokratia” or rule of the people, which was coined from “demos” (people) and “kratos” (power or rule) in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems them existing in Greek city-states, notable Athens. 
The term is an antonym to ‘aristokratia’ which means ‘rule of an elite’. WBLS-OBE MELC-Aligned Self-Learning Module English 11 - EAPP 10 While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice, the distinction has been blurred historically. 
The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. 
In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of all elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. 
The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy. 
Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. 
Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution. 
There were five (5) techniques used in defining the concept. Your challenge is to identify all five and write the sentences where these techniques can be found.

In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games.
