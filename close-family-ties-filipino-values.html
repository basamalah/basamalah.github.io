They place high regard and put importance on their family before anything else. They work all day and do all they can to feedand provide for their family. In other countries, when a person turns 18, he/she can live away from his/her family. In the Philippines, they value their family so much that they keep them intact through the years. One of the precious things Filipinos have is that they are respectful. Young, youth, people in all ages know how to show respect and courtesy. Some ways to show them are the use of “Po at Opo", "Pagmamano” or putting the back of an elder's hand on your forehead, and calling our older siblings or elders Ate or Kuya​</a>

                        <p><strong>I agree with all the five statements above for the following reasons:</strong></p><strong>Yes,</strong> I couldn't even agree more with this statement.<strong> The media today are not only more influential but we can say they have taken over the world. </strong>Almost all aspects of society are connected to the internet and email as a media connection. Trade, transportation and culinary are currently using media and technology to increase business effectiveness.<strong>Yes, the presence of technology creates some changes in the norms of society, especially in the younger generation who are growing up in the era of technological development. </strong>Technology creates a situation where young and old look the same so that there is no age gap, even in some situations, the younger generation doesn't seem to respect older people due to the influence of the development of technology, especially on social media. This is certainly a change in the values and norms in society.<strong>Yes, </strong>there is a quote who said “thecnology bring those far away much closer and making those near us more distant." This quote is quite relevant at this time because<strong> most of  Filipinos tend to focus on social media interactions rather than interacting with oldschool methods that rely on family ties. </strong>Especially young generation who prefer to hang out with people who have the same technological culture than with the closest people such as neighbors and relatives.<strong>Yes, </strong>tolerance for a behavior is increasingly experiencing flexibility. <strong>The influx of globalization and foreign cultures has made some behaviors that were initially considered bad in our country today, slowly starting to be accepted by society </strong>and acculturation of our culture with foreign cultures, especially from western countries.<strong>Yes, with the development of technology and social media, people tend to be very easy to interact via online with someone they have never met before. </strong>We can even interact and comunicate with people from other countries. However, the quality of interaction tends to be very low because there is no inner connection that allows us to understand each other because we only interact online.<p><strong>Learn More About :</strong></p><p>What are the pros and cons of tecnological advancement in communication? https://brainly.ph/question/14539974</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
