“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</a>

                                            Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</a>

                            1. theory of the origin of life essay​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>How life arose is a question that is fundamental to both philosophy and science. Responses to it enable one, in turn, to answer such questions as, “Who am I?”, “Why am I here?”, and “How do I make sense of this world?” This secondary set of questions can be answered in a myriad of ways for a variety of reasons, but the answer to the first question has only two responses. As Douglas Futuyuma says, “Creation and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things” (197). Either we are the product of the chemical and physical laws of nature operating over time, or we have been formed, at least in part, by some supernatural Force or Deity. The acceptance of one of these options as a foundation will determine how one will establish a belief system to determine his place in the world. This is a matter of crucial importance, yet in most biology classes offered at U.C. Davis, we learn that life came from nonlife by strictly natural (as opposed to supernatural) processes. The possibility that perhaps the origin of life cannot be explained by a natural mechanism is ignored, and this is disturbing. For if we limit what explanations we are willing to accept for the origin of life, we could be closing our eyes to reality.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>  The origin of the first form of life has been an intriguing concept for many years. Different theories and experimental proofs were forwarded by different scientists during the time interval. Some of these theories were rejected as they failed to provide shreds of evidence while some others were accepted. However, there is no theory that could provide a wholesome view of the origin of life. The following theories have been suggested over the years.</p><p></p><p>   Theory of special creation- This theory suggests that all the living forms were created as it is by God. Different religions have different narratives as fas as this theory is concerned. There is no scientific ground for this theory.</p><p></p><p>   Theory of Spontaneous generation- This theory suggested for the origin of living forms from the non-living or inanimate objects. Aristotle, Epicurus, Vel Holmont are some of the supporters. They believed that a slice of rotten meat gave birth to the maggots. This was disapproved.</p><p></p><p>   Theory of Panspermia- This theory suggested by Richter in 1865 and proposed that life reached the earth from other cosmic bodies and lastly the Theory of biochemical evolution or Materialistic Theory- This theory was suggested by Oparin in 1923 and Haldane in 1928. It suggested that primitive earth was reducing in nature due to the absence of oxygen and several chemicals condensed together in oceans, warmed by hot temperature, formed a 'primordial' soup' in which the first living cell took its form. Several amino acids, nucleic acids, sugars and other organic and inorganic molecules together formed coacervated that were capable of absorbing water and nutrients and perform budding. These kept on uniting with more and more molecules and formed the first living cell.</p><p></p><p>   The theory of biochemical origin had been experimentally supported by Urey and Miller, where they developed primitive Earth-like conditions by providing lightning, water vapors, and inorganic molecules and obtained the </p><p>organic molecules.</p><p></p><p>   Hence, it can be concluded that a little insight exists about the origin of life but there are still more possibilities to explore. With the advancement in scientific technologies, there are chances of gathering more pieces of evidence in this regard.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The source is from toppr :)</p><p></p><br />

Putting his life in danger, valentine continued performing marriage ceremonies, doing so in secret and hidden from the eyes of authorities. Still, word of valentines secret ceremonies made its way back to claudius the priest was found and put to death on, as some versions state, on february 14th.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sir Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Action and Reaction, states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law was first published in his book "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" in 1687. Newton's Third Law is a fundamental principle in physics and has been tested extensively through experiments and observations.</p><p></p><p>To test his Third Law, Newton designed a variety of experiments. One such experiment involved firing cannonballs from a cannon. The cannonball was propelled forward by the explosion of gunpowder inside the cannon. However, at the same time, the cannon itself recoiled backward due to the reaction force generated by the explosion. Another experiment involved a person standing on a skateboard, pushing against a wall. The person would move backward due to the reaction force generated by their push.</p><p></p><p>Newton's Third Law has numerous applications in everyday life. For example, when a person jumps off a diving board, the force exerted by the person's feet on the board propels them into the air. At the same time, an equal and opposite reaction force is exerted on the diving board, causing it to bounce back. In driving a car, the tires exert a force on the road, and the road exerts an equal and opposite force on the tires, propelling the car forward.</p><p></p><p>Online evidence for Newton's Third Law can be found in a variety of sources, including academic articles, scientific journals, and educational websites. One such source is the website "Physics Classroom," which provides an overview of Newton's Third Law, along with numerous examples and interactive simulations.</p><p></p><p> The link to the webpage is: </p><p></p><p>https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-4/Newton-s-Third-Law.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Newton's Third Law of Motion has its origins in his book "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" and was published in 1687. Newton tested this law through a variety of experiments, including the cannonball experiment and the skateboard experiment. This law is applicable to numerous situations in everyday life, and it has been extensively tested and observed through scientific experiments. Online evidence of this law can be found in various sources, including the "Physics Classroom" website.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>follow and list me as brain list so that I can answer your questions </p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sir Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Action and Reaction, states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This law was first published in 1687 in Newton's book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica. </p><p></p><p>Newton tested this law by using a cannonball experiment. He placed a cannonball on a flat surface and fired it with gunpowder. The force of the gunpowder propelled the cannonball forward while simultaneously pushing back against the ground with an equal amount of force, causing it to recoil backwards. </p><p></p><p>This law can be seen in everyday life when riding a bike or skateboard; when you push down on one pedal or skateboard wheel, your body moves forward due to the reaction from that pedal or wheel pushing back against your foot with an equal amount of force. It can also be seen when throwing a ball; as you throw it forward, your arm is pushed backward due to the reaction from throwing it forward with an equal amount of force. </p><p></p><p>The Third Law has been used to explain many phenomena such as why rockets are able to fly into space; they are propelled upwards by exhaust gases which push downwards against them with an equal amount of force, causing them to move upwards away from Earth’s gravitational pull. It has also been used to explain why airplanes are able to fly; their wings create lift by pushing air downwards which causes them to move upwards due to the reaction from that air pushing back up against them with an equal amount of force. </p><p></p><p>Online evidence: </p><p></p><p>1) https://www2.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-3/Newton-s-Third-Law - This website provides information about Newton’s Third Law including its origin and how he tested it along with examples of how this law applies in everyday life such as riding bikes and skateboards and throwing balls..  </p><p></p><p>2) https://www2bioedonlineorg/lessons-and-more/activity_files/newtons_third_lawhtml - This website provides information about how Newton’s Third Law explains why rockets are able fly into space and why airplanes are able fly along with diagrams illustrating these concepts..</p><br />

“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</h2><br />

In comparison to a personal essay, a formal essay is more meticulously planned and serious. Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman who lived between the mid-1950s and the early 1600s, is credited with creating the formal essay. His works cover topics like death, fear, truth, and riches and are condensed, impartial, and informed. The writing style of a personal essay is informal and conversational. The informality of the personal essay is one of its main qualities. Its primary goal is to pique interest, with informational value coming second. As a result, compared to the formal essay, it is a more aesthetic and less practical type of production.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            16. Directions: Read and understand the essay. Summarize the key points using the cause-and-effect diagram found below. Write your answer in your activity notebook. More and more women are now going out to work and some women are now the major salary earner in the family. What are the causes of this, and what effect is this having on families and society? In the past, most women stayed at home to take care of domestic chores such as cooking or cleaning. Women's liberation and feminism have meant that this situation has been transformed and in contemporary society women are playing an almost equal role to men in terms of work. This has had significant consequences, both in terms of the family, for example by improving quality of life and increasing children's sense of independence, and for society itself with greater gender equality. The main reasons behind the increase of women in the workplace are women's liberation and feminism. The women's liberation movement originated in the 1960s and was popularized by authors such as Simone de Beauvoir. As a consequence of this, new legislation emerged, granting women equal rights to men in many fields, in particular employment. Because of feminist ideas, men have taken up roles which were previously seen as being for women only, most importantly those related to child rearing. As a result of this, women have more time to pursue their own careers and interests. These have led to some significant effects, both to family life and to society. Although the earning capacity of a woman in her lifetime is generally much less than that of a man, she can nevertheless make a significant contribution to the family income. The most important consequence of this is an improved quality of life. By helping to maintain a steady income for the family, the pressure on the husband is considerably reduced, hence improving both the husband's and the wife's emotional wellbeing. Additionally, the purchasing power of the family will also be raised. This means that the family can afford more luxuries such as foreign travel and a family car. A further effect on the family is the promotion of independence in the children. Some might argue that having both parents working might be damaging to the children because of a lack of parental attention. However, such children have to learn to look after themselves at an earlier age, and their parents often rely on them to help with the housework. This teaches them important life skills. As regards society, women going to work are greater gender equality. There are an increasing number of women who are becoming politicians, lawyers, and even CEOs and company managers. This is greater equality for women in all areas of life, not just in employment. For example, women today have much stronger legal rights to protect themselves against domestic violence and sexual discrimination in the workplace. In conclusion, the increasing number of women at work has brought about some important changes to family life, including improved quality of life and increased independence for children, as well as society itself. It is clear that the sexes are still a long way from being equal in all areas of life; however, and perhaps the challenge for the present century is to ensure that this takes place. ​</h2><br />

                        <p>One of the most memorable conflicts I have encountered in my life was a disagreement with a close friend. We had been friends for a long time and had always been able to talk through any issues that arose. However, one day we had a disagreement that quickly escalated into a full-blown argument.</p><p></p><p>I was hurt and angry, and my friend was defensive and dismissive of my concerns. It seemed like there was no way to resolve the conflict and salvage our friendship.</p><p></p><p>After some time had passed, we both took a step back and reflected on what had happened. We realized that we had both been approaching the situation from a place of hurt and defensiveness, and that we needed to listen to each other more carefully.</p><p></p><p>We sat down and had a long, honest conversation about what had happened, why we were both upset, and what we could do to move forward. We both apologized for any hurtful things we had said, and we were able to find common ground and come to a resolution that felt fair and satisfying to both of us.</p><p></p><p>What I learned from this experience is that conflicts can be incredibly difficult and emotional, but they can also be opportunities for growth and connection. By listening to each other with compassion and empathy, and approaching the conflict with an open mind and heart, we were able to overcome our disagreement and deepen our friendship in the process.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) The Origins of Life</p><p></p><p>Before any speculation toward the origin of biotic forms, what was present at the formation of the earth that could result in inorganic, then organic, and later biotic creatures? Early atmospheric conditions have been theorized to be present due to planetesimal collisions releasing gases present in the Earth, after the initial atmosphere of Hydrogen and Helium escaped Earth’s gravity assisted by heat energy. The earlier atmosphere is believed to have consisted mainly of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen (bonded to other elements) in such forms as CO2/CO, N2, and H20. Stanley Miller, through experimentation, shows that given an energy source like heat or electric charge it is possible to form reactions that create complex molecules, and through subsequent experiments nucleic acids like adenine were even formed. This is the premise for the “hot” theories of the origin of life. Given there are many derivative possibilities like process evolution, chemoautotrophic, and photoautotrophic origins, the basis is that given an energy source (heat) basic elements can form and break bonds to become increasingly complex</p><p></p><p>2.) Life forms evolve and adapt to a specific environment. When conditions at the surface of the Earth (temperatures, atmospheric or oceanic compositions for example) change faster than the rate of evolution, species disappear on a large scale. They are soon replaced by new species more adapted to the new conditions.Mass extinctions happen because of climate change, asteroid impacts, massive volcanic eruptions or a combination of these causes. One famous mass extinction event is the one that lead to the extinction of dinosaurs, 65 million years ago.</p><p></p><p>3.) The results of a study released in the summer of 2011 have shown that the decline in the numbers of large predators like sharks, lions and wolves is disrupting Earth's ecosystem in all kinds of unusual ways. The study, conducted by scientists from 22 different institutions in six countries, confirmed the sixth mass extinction. The study states that this mass extinction differs from previous ones because it is entirely driven by human activity through changes in land use, climate, pollution, hunting, fishing and poaching. The effects of the loss of these large predators can be seen in the oceans and on land.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>:)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>T</strong><strong> </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>P</strong><strong>S</strong></p><p>More than 99 percent of all organisms that have ever lived on Earth are extinct. As new species evolve to fit ever changing ecological niches, older species fade away. But the rate of extinction is far from constant. At least a handful of times in the last 500 million years, 75 to more than 90 percent of all species on Earth have disappeared in a geological blink of an eye in catastrophes we call mass extinctions.</p><p></p><p>Though mass extinctions are deadly events, they open up the planet for new forms of life to emerge. The most studied mass extinction, which marked the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods about 66 million years ago, killed off the nonavian dinosaurs and made room for mammals and birds to rapidly diversify and evolve</p><br />
