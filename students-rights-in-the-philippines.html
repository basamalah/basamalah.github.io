                                            4. Educational researchers have found that there is a strong correlation between reading andacademic success. "Research findings in applied linguistics and reading research consistentlyshow a strong correlation between reading proficiency and academic success at all ages, fromthe primary school right through to university level: students who read a lot and whounderstand what they read usually attain good grades" (Pretorious, 2000). An ACT news release(Aug. 17, 2005) stated, "Reading skills are critical to a student's success in college coursesacross the board... students who don't have adequate reading comprehension skills are likely tostruggle.” Proficient reading skills are inextricably linked to problem solving, critical thinking,writing, researching, reasoning, and creativity. In other words, a student who is a good reader ismore likely to do well in school and pass exams than a student who is a weak reader.(Adopted from A Critique of K - 12 Philippine Education System by Maria Teresa F.

YOUR FINAL TASKS
Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses
can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected
under Philippine and international law.

(PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE ABOVE)
ABOUT LGBT
below are my groupmates answers on other questions(IT COULD HELP YOU). and i have to answer that one above. I hope my answer makes sense with my groupmates answers. and even better if the answer is long as my groupmates answers.
What is the issue phenomenon that you choose?
The phenomenon that we chose is the discrimination against LGBT students in the Philippines. Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and some cases of physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students' right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.
Can you explain the social content of the issue/problem/phenomenon? How can Sociology help understand and address the issue or problem?
LGBTQ rights as gender rights- Lets us all remember that it is not only women and man who should be considered when gender equality is discussed. True gender equalities deals with the empowerment of the marginalized sector of society; women who are deprived of their basic rights, men who are abused and laughed at due to social anomalies, and the LGBTQ community that continues to face discrimination and hatred, which hinder their full potential as persons and human beings. 
Sociology examines the relationship between individuals and society, which includes social institutions like the family, gender, military, economy and education. As a social science, sociology offers an objective and systematic approach to understanding the causes of social problems.</a>

                                            can someone pls summarize or give a conclusion about this?Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected under Philippine and international law. In recent years, lawmakers and school administrators in the Philippines have recognized that bullying of LGBT youth is a serious problem, and designed interventions to address it. In 2012, the Department of Education (DepEd), which oversees primary and secondary schools, enacted a Child Protection Policy designed to address bullying and discrimination in schools, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The following year, Congress passed the Anti-Bullying Law of 2013, with implementing rules and regulations that enumerate sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds for bullying and harassment. The adoption of these policies sends a strong signal that bullying and discrimination are unacceptable and should not be tolerated in educational institutions.​</a>

More countries are getting poorer while other countries maintain their progressive economic status and some are continuously progressive in terms of economy. With this unequal growth of economy, more resources are wasted while other resources also are taken for granted. It is in this thought that I want to help pursue the idea of             de-development. As a student, I can do this by not buying or purchasing things which are not necessary. Since the idea of de-development is helping each country sustain each development by fair economic growth and cutting consumption (economic resources, food and material things,etc.) to maintain the economy's equilibrium, I can be of help in the process.  By doing so, I know that I can be of help, not only in my country but also to the whole world.</p><p></p><p>Read more about de-development:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1936889</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1849716</p><p></p><p>BrainlyFast</p><br />

                            6. 4. Educational researchers have found that there is a strong correlation between reading andacademic success. "Research findings in applied linguistics and reading research consistentlyshow a strong correlation between reading proficiency and academic success at all ages, fromthe primary school right through to university level: students who read a lot and whounderstand what they read usually attain good grades" (Pretorious, 2000). An ACT news release(Aug. 17, 2005) stated, "Reading skills are critical to a student's success in college coursesacross the board... students who don't have adequate reading comprehension skills are likely tostruggle.” Proficient reading skills are inextricably linked to problem solving, critical thinking,writing, researching, reasoning, and creativity. In other words, a student who is a good reader ismore likely to do well in school and pass exams than a student who is a weak reader.(Adopted from A Critique of K - 12 Philippine Education System by Maria Teresa F.

YOUR FINAL TASKS
Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses
can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected
under Philippine and international law.

(PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE ABOVE)
ABOUT LGBT
below are my groupmates answers on other questions(IT COULD HELP YOU). and i have to answer that one above. I hope my answer makes sense with my groupmates answers. and even better if the answer is long as my groupmates answers.
What is the issue phenomenon that you choose?
The phenomenon that we chose is the discrimination against LGBT students in the Philippines. Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and some cases of physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students' right to education, protected under Philippine and international law.
Can you explain the social content of the issue/problem/phenomenon? How can Sociology help understand and address the issue or problem?
LGBTQ rights as gender rights- Lets us all remember that it is not only women and man who should be considered when gender equality is discussed. True gender equalities deals with the empowerment of the marginalized sector of society; women who are deprived of their basic rights, men who are abused and laughed at due to social anomalies, and the LGBTQ community that continues to face discrimination and hatred, which hinder their full potential as persons and human beings. 
Sociology examines the relationship between individuals and society, which includes social institutions like the family, gender, military, economy and education. As a social science, sociology offers an objective and systematic approach to understanding the causes of social problems.</h2><br />

                            26. can someone pls summarize or give a conclusion about this?Schools should be safe places for everyone. But in the Philippines, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) too often find that their schooling experience is marred by bullying, discrimination, lack of access to LGBT-related information, and in some cases, physical or sexual assault. These abuses can cause deep and lasting harm and curtail students’ right to education, protected under Philippine and international law. In recent years, lawmakers and school administrators in the Philippines have recognized that bullying of LGBT youth is a serious problem, and designed interventions to address it. In 2012, the Department of Education (DepEd), which oversees primary and secondary schools, enacted a Child Protection Policy designed to address bullying and discrimination in schools, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The following year, Congress passed the Anti-Bullying Law of 2013, with implementing rules and regulations that enumerate sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds for bullying and harassment. The adoption of these policies sends a strong signal that bullying and discrimination are unacceptable and should not be tolerated in educational institutions.​</h2><br />
