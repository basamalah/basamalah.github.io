                                            STORY:Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit.

                                            On this age of technology, sources of information include both print and non-print materials. You have the choice which to use, so you should know how these materials are different from each other. Print materials refer to all paper publications in printed form. Examples of these are published books, journals, magazines, newspapers, dictionaries and encyclopedias – all these, you can hold and grab. You can scan through their pages and read the contents conveniently. It is said that they are reliable and affordable for most people who value these resources. On the other hand, nonprint materials are those that have special formats. The information they give can only be accessed or reached by using machines or digital equipment like computers, tablets and cellular phones. Examples of these materials are e-books, e-journals, e-photographs, compact discs, records, slides, videos and films. These can relay information faster. Now, the choice is yours.

                                            ains Some very important tasks you do in school either face-to-face or distance learning requires writing compositions and presenting oral and written reports. In today's lesson, you will learn to organize information from secondary sources in preparation for writing. reporting and similar academic tasks in collaboration with others. A secondary source is a document or recording that gives information from a primary source. The original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Some examples are reference materials, nonfiction books, biographies, nonprint materials, almanacs, atlases and gazetteers, specialized references, CD-ROM references. periodicals, encyclopedias, video references and electronic databases. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Using primary source or secondary source helps you gather information. On the other hand, organizing information needs thorough reading, gathering information, validating the facts, and writing comprehensively. You may use the following ideas in organizing information from the secondary sources: Location-you can organize information by showing visual depiction of a physical space. You may use diagrams, analogues, graphic representations and maps to organize location. For example: Parts of the nervous system that may be presented using a diagram. Alphabet-some information is easy to organize using specific terms in alphabetical order like in dictionaries and index (at the back of a textbook). Time-another important factor in organizing information is the time element like history of humanity or events happened in a person's life journey. You may use fish bone, timeline, steps and cycle graphic organizers. Category-the use of category in presenting information is different from time. This type is used to group similar characteristics such as color, size, usage, brand, texture, materials, gender, age, model, price, content and nature. For example: Types of vehicles that may be written and presented according to usage, brand name, model and price, Hierarchy-hierarchies are used to indicate the ranks as to heaviest to lightest, smallest to biggest. For example: Rank of population in Lucena City. This is showing how one piece of information is connected to another broader information that you like to emphasize in your written and oral reports Answer the following questions: 1. What are the secondary sources of information? 2. What different ideas can you use in organizing information from secondary sources? 3. How are these ideas helpful in organizing information? mustions that​</a>

                            11. STORY:Grandparent's Day In Filipino culture and tradition, grandparents and elders receive a high level of respect. Setting aside special honors for grandparents appears to be natural to us as it is in the rest of Asia. Thus, it perfectly natural that the nation should observe Grandparent's Day. Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates Grandparent's Day today, it is an appropriate time for young Filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents. No two families are alike, but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. Make today a special day for Grandma and Grandpa. Grandparent's Day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life. HAPPY CRANDPARENTS DAY QUESTION:Activity 2: Answer Me! Direction: Go back to the editorial sample.

                            16. On this age of technology, sources of information include both print and non-print materials. You have the choice which to use, so you should know how these materials are different from each other. Print materials refer to all paper publications in printed form. Examples of these are published books, journals, magazines, newspapers, dictionaries and encyclopedias – all these, you can hold and grab. You can scan through their pages and read the contents conveniently. It is said that they are reliable and affordable for most people who value these resources. On the other hand, nonprint materials are those that have special formats. The information they give can only be accessed or reached by using machines or digital equipment like computers, tablets and cellular phones. Examples of these materials are e-books, e-journals, e-photographs, compact discs, records, slides, videos and films. These can relay information faster. Now, the choice is yours.

In today's lesson, you will learn to organize information from secondary sources in preparation for writing. reporting and similar academic tasks in collaboration with others. A secondary source is a document or recording that gives information from a primary source. The original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Some examples are reference materials, nonfiction books, biographies, nonprint materials, almanacs, atlases and gazetteers, specialized references, CD-ROM references. periodicals, encyclopedias, video references and electronic databases. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. Using primary source or secondary source helps you gather information. On the other hand, organizing information needs thorough reading, gathering information, validating the facts, and writing comprehensively. You may use the following ideas in organizing information from the secondary sources: Location-you can organize information by showing visual depiction of a physical space. You may use diagrams, analogues, graphic representations and maps to organize location. For example: Parts of the nervous system that may be presented using a diagram. Alphabet-some information is easy to organize using specific terms in alphabetical order like in dictionaries and index (at the back of a textbook). Time-another important factor in organizing information is the time element like history of humanity or events happened in a person's life journey. You may use fish bone, timeline, steps and cycle graphic organizers. Category-the use of category in presenting information is different from time. This type is used to group similar characteristics such as color, size, usage, brand, texture, materials, gender, age, model, price, content and nature. For example: Types of vehicles that may be written and presented according to usage, brand name, model and price, Hierarchy-hierarchies are used to indicate the ranks as to heaviest to lightest, smallest to biggest. For example: Rank of population in Lucena City.

What are the secondary sources of information? 2. What different ideas can you use in organizing information from secondary sources? 3.

My mask represent as an animal mask because it can help them communicate with the spirits who live in forests. My mask would be used in in all most traditional African ceremonies related to or like weddings, funerals, initiation rites, and cleansing.
