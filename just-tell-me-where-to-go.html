For me, deciding whether to go out or not is like a death and life situated. But five days before Christmas, I went out with a friend without thinking twice or thrice. Did I regret it? I didn’t. Because even though I wasn’t in my comfort zone, it felt like I was still at home. My friend invited me to go out as planned, and it was supposed to be happening five days after. But since I thought I have to, I agreed to her right away. Two o’clock was the set time, but we left twenty minutes after three in the afternoon. She informed me just thirty minutes before two and I had so much to do. I was ready to go, locked the door, and walked. I opened my umbrella and put my backpack in front of me. From Tanay Park, we planned to go to the town’s dike often called as “Dike ng Tanay”. After how many days, ngayon na lang ako ulit nakalabas,” I said to her as we walked. We were happy though it was sunny and hot. We talked a lot about anything that mostly made us laugh. We even shared insights about our studies. The sun was still there maintaining the warmness and humid of the air, but we managed to arrive without any complaint. When we were just meters away, I asked her to take a photo of me while walking towards the dike. “Continue, stop, continue,” she reminded. Once we got there, we sat on the bench, facing the picturesque and calm view of the lake. We took photos from the dike to the magnificent lighthouse of Tanay, the abundant water lilies on the shore, colorful boats, blue and clear sky and the busy road where people were enjoying the sunset view of Tanay Dike. After spending an hour doing a lot of things, we decided to leave and to go to another place. We were now going to the nearby dike. It took us twice the time and distance. There, we had some complaints of tiredness. Our feet were already aching, and we were really tired walking. Despite quitting, we ignored it and just talked and laughed. As we go nearer the place, we have seen the sun was about to set, and we did not notice the air was becoming cooler as the time passed by. It was getting dark and the streetlights were starting to open. It was a comfortable feeling especially when the people started walking out. Suddenly, I thought of the things that sadden me. The things I wish I could and couldn’t have. Then I remembered how long I have run before. I became motivated, thinking of the idea that I would never get rid of this feeling wherever I go. Someday, I guess, I’d be loving to hang out with friends while travelling the world together. Life won’t run in your comfort zone throughout the years, and I.​</a>

As she went along, she began thinking of what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. "I'll buy some chicken from Mang Tomas," said she, "and they will lay eggs each morning, then I will sell the eggs to the mayor's wife. With the money that I will get from the sale of the eggs, I'm sure I can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I go to the market, I would be a muse. Will not the young men come up and speak to me! na will be jealous, but I do not care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this." As she spoke, she tossed her head back, the pail fell, and the milk was spilled. She had to go home and tell her mother what happened. Answer the questions. 1. Who is the character in the story? 2. Where is she going to deliver the milk? 3. What happened when she tossed her head back while carrying the pail of milk? 4. Why did she toss her head back?​</a>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</a>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

                                            The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

Kindly shorten your answers thru bulleted form.Leaving the Comfort ZoneBehind Trisha Kris P. AquinoWriting is like talking to somebody, so let me tell you a story. For me, deciding whether to go out or not is like a death and life situated. But five days before Christmas, I went out with a friend without thinking twice or thrice. Did I regret it? I didn’t. Because even though I wasn’t in my comfort zone, it felt like I was still at home. My friend invited me to go out as planned, and it was supposed to be happening five days after. But since I thought I have to, I agreed to her right away. Two o’clock was the set time, but we left twenty minutes after three in the afternoon. She informed me just thirty minutes before two and I had so much to do. I was ready to go, locked the door, and walked. I opened my umbrella and put my backpack in front of me. From Tanay Park, we planned to go to the town’s dike often called as “Dike ng Tanay”. After how many days, ngayon na lang ako ulit nakalabas,” I said to her as we walked. We were happy though it was sunny and hot. We talked a lot about anything that mostly made us laugh. We even shared insights about our studies. The sun was still there maintaining the warmness and humid of the air, but we managed to arrive without any complaint. When we were just meters away, I asked her to take a photo of me while walking towards the dike. “Continue, stop, continue,” she reminded. Once we got there, we sat on the bench, facing the picturesque and calm view of the lake. We took photos from the dike to the magnificent lighthouse of Tanay, the abundant water lilies on the shore, colorful boats, blue and clear sky and the busy road where people were enjoying the sunset view of Tanay Dike. After spending an hour doing a lot of things, we decided to leave and to go to another place. We were now going to the nearby dike. It took us twice the time and distance. There, we had some complaints of tiredness. Our feet were already aching, and we were really tired walking. Despite quitting, we ignored it and just talked and laughed. As we go nearer the place, we have seen the sun was about to set, and we did not notice the air was becoming cooler as the time passed by. It was getting dark and the streetlights were starting to open. It was a comfortable feeling especially when the people started walking out. Suddenly, I thought of the things that sadden me. The things I wish I could and couldn’t have. Then I remembered how long I have run before. I became motivated, thinking of the idea that I would never get rid of this feeling wherever I go. Someday, I guess, I’d be loving to hang out with friends while travelling the world together. Life won’t run in your comfort zone throughout the years, and I.​</h2><br />

As she went along, she began thinking of what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. "I'll buy some chicken from Mang Tomas," said she, "and they will lay eggs each morning, then I will sell the eggs to the mayor's wife. With the money that I will get from the sale of the eggs, I'm sure I can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I go to the market, I would be a muse. Will not the young men come up and speak to me! na will be jealous, but I do not care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this." As she spoke, she tossed her head back, the pail fell, and the milk was spilled. She had to go home and tell her mother what happened. Answer the questions. 1. Who is the character in the story? 2. Where is she going to deliver the milk? 3. What happened when she tossed her head back while carrying the pail of milk? 4. Why did she toss her head back?​</h2><br />

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</h2><br />

                            28. The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved
