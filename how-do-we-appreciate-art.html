                                            . Let's Analyze Read and examine this statement of Missy Writes (2017) about the promotion of art in the Philippines. Afterwards, answer and do the following indicated questions and task. Write your answer on your answer sheet. "I believe that each agency has its own job that will help in keeping Philippine known to a lot of people not just here in the Philippines. I also believe that they are essential because nowadays, a lot of people are not that interested as before in local products and most especially the arts because they usually like foreign products. With these agencies, they keep Philippine art alive. Because of them, we learn to appreciate and love our own. And eventually, and hopefully in the future, we Filipinos will be able to promote and be proud of our own art, history, and culture" (Writes, 2017). ) 1) If you were given an opportunity to create an agency that would promote and preserve arts from the regions of the Philippines, what will be the name of the agency? 2) What will be the three main goals or focuses of the agency? 3) As a student, how will you promote traditional and contemporary Philippine arts?

                        <p>Knowing <strong>contemporary art</strong> from different <strong>regions</strong> is important due to its historical value being a product and witness of a specific time and era. Understanding the process of creating the <strong>artwork</strong> can help one appreciate it. It allows us to express, understand, and challenge specific <strong>sociocultural</strong> or<strong> ideological/political</strong> developments, so promoting <strong>discussion</strong>, and raising <strong>consciousness.</strong></p><p></p><p>It's <strong>crucial</strong> to be familiar with modern art from many places. It allows us to express, understand, and challenge specific sociocultural or ideological/political developments, so promoting discussion, raising consciousness, and stopping the world. Contemporary art has <strong>historical</strong> significance. This value is as crucial as it has ever been in human history. A particular historical moment is captured in art. It is a crucial component of our collective memory and history. It is also a nuanced representation of a historical way of thinking, the outcome of a certain <strong>worldview</strong> from a particular time.</p><p>Art has <strong>educational</strong> significance as well. Contemporary art can aid in <strong>personal</strong> <strong>growth</strong>. It enables the individual to mature as a person, broadening their <strong>perspective</strong> on the world or even discovering or inventing their own viewing point or viewpoint onto a given issue, just like other kinds of <strong>cultural</strong> expression like film, literature, or performing arts.</p><p>Understanding the process of creating the artwork can help one <strong>appreciate</strong> it. Get rid of the idea that art must resemble something identifiable. In modern art, realism of any kind almost never appears unless it serves as a <strong>deliberate</strong> counter-statement. Think about the work both near and far. After that, embrace it and sense its life and spirit. Look for its cunningness and analyze its approach. If it's a painting, pay particular attention to the use of color, paint, and draftsmanship. Take into account <strong>line</strong>, <strong>composition</strong>, <strong>texture</strong>, <strong>scale</strong>, and <strong>light</strong>. Analyze your own subjective reaction and contrast it with other works. Consider the work's novelty at the time it was created as well as the artist's artistic goals. Pay close attention and make an effort to understand the decisions the artist made and how they affect the work. Consider how it links to what comes before, what comes after, and what comes after it if you have any knowledge of art history. </p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about</strong> artwork here https://brainly.ph/question/10907847<br /><br /><strong>#SPJ6</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I will admit to being a more of a lover of Renaissance and Baroque Art, but I finally came to appreciate the place Modern Art has come to represent an previous era. Therefore, I believe Contemporary Art to be incredibly important to today’s society. Just like Modern Art before it, there’s a reason that contemporary art isn’t revered by society: they don’t understand it… yet.</p><p></p><p>The truth of the matter is the diverse perspectives that are expressed through contemporary art are incredibly valuable to society, and reflect the many changes that we’ve had both in philosophy and in science over the course of our lifetimes. One thing is always going to be true: contemporary art is a snapshot of what it was like to live in our present day society, which is going to be valuable in the history of art.</p><p></p><p>Below are three ways in which contemporary art help us to learn new diverse perspectives about the world we live in.</p><p></p><p>You may want to pursue a degree in Contemporary Art. Many people who feel pulled in such a direction, face barriers from friends and family who ask them “Why study contemporary art?” Sometimes families struggle to see the valuable role of art in society and the ways that an aspiring artist can contribute to that role. People may instead push for aspiring artists to become doctors or lawyers—careers that seem more important. The reality is that art is important.</p><br />
