                                            Jane has just begun her new job as on the sales force of a very competitive company. In a sample of 16 sales calls it was found that she closed the contract for an average value of 108 dollars with a standard deviation of 12 dollars. Test at 5% significance that the population mean is at least 100 dollars against the alternative that it is less than 100 dollars. Company policy requires that new members of the sales force must exceed an average of $100 per contract during the trial employment period. Can we conclude that Jane has met this requirement at the significance level of 95%?</a>

                                            Jane has just begun her new job as on the sales force of a very competitive company. In a sample of 16 sales calls it was found that she closed the contract for an average value of 108 dollars with a standard deviation of 12 dollars. Test at 5% significance that the population mean is at least 100 dollars against the alternative that it is less than 100 dollars. Company policy requires that new members of the sales force must exceed an average of $100 per contract during the trial employment period. Can we conclude that Jane has met this requirement at the significance level of 95%?</a>

Can there be a sale without a price? 3. Enumerate and define the kinds of contract of sale.4. Distinguish Contract of Sale and Contract to Sell. 5. Distinguish Contract to sell and conditional deed of sale.​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>1. The essence of consent in the contract of sale refers to the mutual agreement between the buyer and seller on the essential terms of the sale, including the subject matter, price, and conditions of delivery and payment.</p><p></p><p>2. If the price is inadequate, the contract of sale may still be valid, but the buyer may be able to seek a price reduction or cancel the contract. There cannot be a sale without a price, as the price is a necessary element of the agreement.</p><p></p><p>3.The kinds of contract of sale include:</p><p></p><p><strong>Absolute sale:</strong> a sale where ownership of the goods is transferred immediately to the buyer.</p><p><strong>Conditional sale:</strong> a sale where ownership of the goods is transferred to the buyer only upon the occurrence of a specified condition.</p><p><strong>Sale on approval</strong>: a sale where the buyer has the right to inspect the goods and return them within a specified period if they are not satisfactory.</p><p><strong>Sale or return</strong>: a sale where the buyer has the right to return the goods and receive a refund if they are not sold within a specified period.</p><p><strong>Installment sale</strong>: a sale where payment is made in installments over a specified period.</p><p></p><p>4. The main difference between a contract of sale and a contract to sell is that in a contract of sale, ownership of the goods is transferred to the buyer immediately upon the agreement, while in a contract to sell, ownership remains with the seller until certain conditions are met, such as full payment by the buyer.</p><p></p><p>5. A contract to sell and a conditional deed of sale are similar in that ownership of the goods remains with the seller until certain conditions are met. The difference is that a contract to sell is an agreement to transfer ownership in the future, while a conditional deed of sale is a present transfer of ownership that is subject to certain conditions, such as payment or delivery.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa Brainliest Thankyouu,</p><p>sana makatulong</p><p></p><br />
