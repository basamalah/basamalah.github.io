The specialty hospitals attribute the disparity to operational functions; general hospitals serve of a wide variety of conditions while specialty hospitals are targeted to a specific service line. ... "The biggest single difference is overhead.</p><p>3. In simple words health center is one by which we can prevent our diseases while in hospitals we cure them. Health center is just a primary care arena while a hospital is the next stage to healing. A hospital should have emergency services, an operating room, labor and delivery, intensive care, and radiology.</p><p>4.CNAs and LPNs are considered allied health professionals due to their limited educational scope and abilities. RNs and APRNs, on the other hand, are considered medical professionals because of their thorough, rigorous training and degrees.</p><br />
