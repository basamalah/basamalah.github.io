                            8. the anatomy of a filipino by prof.felix bautista</h2><br />
                        <strong>The Anatomy of a Filipino</strong><p><strong>The anatomy of a Filipino </strong>by Prof. Felix Bautista talks about what it takes to be classified as a Filipino and how Filipino can one be? Also would it really matter if ever we are from a different race and has different a name?
</p><p>The poem the <strong>Anatomy of a Filipino</strong> starts by a changing of lines from boys to girls and girls to boys. Those students saying stuff about being a Filipino aren’t exactly a born Filipino. It includes racial differences, having foreign names, being a foreigner born in the Philippines.
</p><p>Examples of the said qualities in the <strong>Anatomy of a Filipino</strong>:
</p>Some have an American First Name
Some has a Chinese Last Name
They speak in English
They buy foreign products
They eat foreign cooking
<p>But amidst those qualities that they have, are they short on being a Filipino? In order to become a full-pledged Filipino do we have to be strictly bound to our limitations? Is being a Filipino only mean:
</p>Being born in the Philippines
Buying all local products
Using a local instrument for music
Painting only with local materials
<p>These products-things that we produce as a Filipino were meant to be used from the way or our liking and needs, as it also has a variety of its own. Being fully bound to serving only us Filipinos will only make us close minded and not amiable to accept other foreign things.
</p><p>In order for us to call ourselves a Filipino we must:
</p>Wear our Flag and country with pride
Have a good heart
Immeasurable love for our people and country

Comprising a subject and a predicate, this short and independent syntactic entity intends to convey a complete idea or meanings of an idea.  A simple sentence is also known as a clausal sentence. It may have a modifier besides a subject, verb, and object. Though it is simple, sometimes it can have compound verbs and compound subjects. It may or may not use commas but it stays simple in construction.</p><p>For example:</p>The pen is mightier than the sword.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Anatomy of a Filipino by Professor Felix speaks of our perceived or possible shortcomings as a full-pledged Filipino both in blood and soul. It mainly focuses on the treatment we currently put ourselves in whereas to be a Filipino you need to be born a Filipino.</p><p></p><p>We take pride in our country’s culture and norms as it somehow made our identity much more profound value than what we have in the past. Colonized by other countries left and right our sole identity become clouded and a big blur. We were taught their systems and beliefs; we believed and lived our lives with other people’s identity.</p><p></p><p>With this being a Filipino, it was being considered as a mix and match of countries or a result of constant change in culture. But although it is very clear that we somehow lost a huge part of our own we also gained something in return. We were able to:</p><p></p><p>Speak many languages as possible</p><p>Gain the ability to do what they can do</p><p>Expand our culture and traditions</p><p>The anatomy of a Filipino presented children who bare foreign names since they were born. But they ask if they do have such names are they not considered as a Filipino?  </p><p></p><p>If a Filipino writes his own music using English</p><p>If a Filipino used a foreign instrument  </p><p>If a Filipino doesn’t paint something “Filipino” related</p><p>If Rizal had written his two masterpieces in Spanish</p><p>Are they not considered Filipino anymore? The mere thought of having this kind of unjust treatment in our culture systems just makes us ignorant and somewhat a fool. Whether we were born a Filipino citizen or not; being human and being considered as a people of his country doesn’t get determined by his actions alone.  </p><p></p><p>As long as we have the heart to be a Filipino, as long as we are proud of our shortcomings and what it made us today, as long as we have faith in our mother country and continue to love it willingly then all those unnecessary things such as foreign ties shouldn’t stop us is what we want and what we are.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        The Anatomy of a Filipino By: Prof. Felix Bautista <br />All: I like to think that I am a Filipino, that I am as Good, a Filipino as Anyone.<br />Girls: My heart thrills, when, I Hear, the National anthem, being played.<br />Boys: And my Blood Rises, when, I see our flag, Fluttering in the breeze.<br />All: And Yet, I find myself asking, How Filipino Am I, Really?<br />Boys: My First Name is American.<br />Girls: My Last Name Is Chinese.<br />Boys: When I’ am with Girlfriends or more correctly, when, I’ am with my Friends, who happen to be girls <br />- I talk to them in English.<br />Girls: If they are thirsty, I buy them, a Bottle of American coke.<br />Boys: If they are hungry, I treat them, to an Italian Pizza pie.<br />All: And when, I have the money, I give them a real Chinese Lauriat. <br />Boy (solo): Considering all these, considering my taste, for many things foreign, what right do I have, to call myself, a Filipino?<br />Girls (solo): Should I not call myself, a culture orphan? The illegitimate child of many races?<br />All: Rightly or wrongly, whether we like it or not, we are the end products, of our history, fortunately or unfortunately, our history is a co-mingling, of polyglot influences.<br />Boys: Malayan and Chinese.<br />Girls: Spanish and British.<br />Boys: American and Japanese.<br />All: This is historic fact, we can not ignore, a cultural reality we can not escape, form to believe otherwise is to indulge in fantasy.<br />Boy (solo): I must confess, I’ am an extremely confused, and Bewildered young man. Wherever I’ am, whatever I may be doing, I’ am Bombarded, on all sides, by people who want, me to search for my national identity.<br />All: Tell me the Language I speak should be replaced, by Filipino; they urge me to do away with things foreign to act and think, and buy Filipino.<br />Girl (solo): Even in art, I’ am getting bothered and Bewildered.<br />All: The Writer should use Filipino, as his medium, the nationalists cry.<br />Boys: The Painter should use his genius, in portraying themes purely Filipino, they demand.<br />Girls: The Composer should exploit, endless Possibilities, of the haunting kundiman, they insist.<br />All: All these sound wonderful. But Rizal used Spanish, when he wrote, Noli and Fili.<br />Boys: Was he less of a nationalist, because of it? Must the artist, to be truly Filipino, paint with the juice of the duhat?<br />Girls: And must he draw picture of topless Muslim women or Igorot warriors in G-String?<br />All: And if the composer, desert, the kundiman, and he writes song faithful to the spirit of the Youths of today, does he become Unfilipino? We are what we are today, because of our History.<br />Boys: In our veins, pulses blood with traces of Chinese and Spanish and American, but It does not stop, being a Filipino, because of these. <br />Girls: Out culture, is tinges with foreign, influences, but it has become rich therely. <br />All: This mingling, in fact could speed us on the road, to national greatness, look at America, it is a great country, and yet it is the melting pot of Italian, and German, British, and French, or Irish and Swedish. <br />Boy (solo): Filipinism, after all, is in the heart. <br />All: If that heart beats faster, because the Philippines is making progress, if it Fills, with compassion because its <br />people are suffering, then it belongs to a true Filipino, and it throbs, with pride, in our past, if it pulses with awareness, of the present , if it beats with a faith in the future, then we could ask, for nothing, more all other things are Unimportant.<br />Boys: I have, an American First Name.<br />Girls: And I have, a Chinese Last Name.<br />All: And I’ am proud, very, very proud, - because Underneath these names beats A Filipino Heart…<br />
