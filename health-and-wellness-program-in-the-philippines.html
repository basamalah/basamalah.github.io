                                            Study the text closely. In the middle of this pandemic, people have tried many ways one after another on how to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus as number of infected cases continue to rise. One easy and traditional way that people believe to be effective cure to COVID-19 virus infection is the practice of steam inhalation -locally known as tuob. Rappler.com reported that the employees in Cebu provincial government were instructed to do steam inhalation twice a day at their own workplaces as part of their wellness program. This action serves as their means to battle against the virus. However, this action by the Office of the Governor of Cebu was opposed by WHO Philippines saying that steam inhalation will not prevent one from catching COVID-19. They further elaborated that extremely hot steam can be harmful because of the risk of getting burn injury. Also, they pointed out that science and evidence must be sought in fighting this virus. They clarified that as to date there is no recommended treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 yet. Moreover, they even warned people against self-medicating and using unverified treatments to patients with COVID-19 until there is enough evidence. There is no evidence up to the present time that can attest the efficacy of this inhalation practice in relation to COVID-19. We must not put our health at risk by trying practices not recommended by experts in order to avoid physical health consequences. identify the parts of the text(claim,counterargument,data/evidence,conclusion)​</a>

On the same day, on the other side of the world at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, WHO activated the highest level of alert by declaring COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. The Philippine government mounted a multi-sectoral response to the COVID-19. through the Interagency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases chaired by the Department of Health (DOH). Through the National Action Plan (NAP) on COVID-19. the government aims to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its socioeconomic impacts.The Philippines implemented various actions including a community quarantine in Metro Manila which expanded to Luzon as well as other parts of the country; expanded its testing capacity from one national reference laboratory with the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) to 23 licensed testing labs across the country; worked towards ensuring that its health care system can handle surge capacity, including for financing of services and management of cases needing isolation, quarantine and hospitalization; and addressed the social and economic impact to the community including by providing social amelioration to low income families. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been working with Ministries of Health worldwide to prepare and respond to COVID-19. In the Philippines, WHO country office in the Philippines and its partners have been working with the Department of Health and subnational authorities to respond to the pandemic. The country level response is done with support from the WHO regional office and headquarters.(2020, World Health Organization)​</a>

                                            WHO lauds PH's COVID-19 vaccination drive, suggests ways to improve (ARTICLE)
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 25) — Two officials from the World Health Organization on Wednesday highlighted that the Philippines has vaccinated a significant number of vulnerable individuals, but they said there is room for improvement especially at a time when the more contagious Delta variant is spreading.
Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, said he was pleased to hear that at least 95% of healthcare workers in the country and close to 50% of elderly have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
"The government is putting significant effort in vaccinations," he said in a virtual media briefing.
WHO Essential Medicines and Health Technologies coordinator Dr. Socorro Escalante agreed, saying the Philippines has maximized its capacity to rapidly roll out the limited vaccine supply across the country.
"The vaccination rollout in the Philippines is going quite well," she said. "We have seen that they have a good plan of ensuring that when it is made available, they are distributed to the local government units as soon as possible."
The Philippines has fully vaccinated 13.19 million — or 17% of the target population to reach herd immunity — while 17.49 million have received their first dose.
Escalante noted that while several local governments are successfully carrying out their vaccination program, there are some that can still improve in vaccinating the priority sectors. She added local officials should continue to reach out to the remaining healthcare workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities who haven't received their shots yet.
WHO data showed as of August 24, the Philippines had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region. It was also the country with the most number of infections recorded on that day, followed by Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
The spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant, insufficient adherence to minimum public health standards, and difficulty in detecting asymptomatic or mild cases are among the reasons behind this, WHO officials said.
Kasai said the Delta variant, which is testing the public health capacity of all nations, is invading households.
"Delta's higher transmissibility means clusters of cases are quickly leading to bigger outbreaks especially in the high-risk settings... We are also seeing more clusters in families. Once the virus enters the household, more family members are quickly becoming infected," he said.

                                            From a company that imports bee products from the United States through traders, Milea Bath and Body Wellness Essentials is now taking advantage of local resources on bee products manufacturing.
Imported bees wax, used as raw material for natural and organic personal care products cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, costs P 600 to P1,000 per kilo.
The locally-sourced only costs P150 to P400 per kilo.
Department of Agriculture noted the country imported 400 MT of honey (gathered by bees from plant nectars) in 2009 largely from Australia.
Apiservices reported the Philippines’ importation of bee products totaled to more than $1 billion from 1989 until over the last few years. It indicates brisk demand locally for bees’ natural sweetener and related products.
Bees wax is the natural wax that form the bee hive, the octagonal holes, or the house of honeybees.
The bees also produce propolis, a resinous mixture that bees gather from flowers, tree buds and other botanical sources, enabling it to prevent diseases and block off bacterial growth in the hive.
“The propolis is used as protection of bees from other predators. They use it as antiseptic in their hive to increase their immune system, but we can use it for our purpose, for human health protection,” said Dr. Cleofas Cervancia, University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB) project leader for Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR)-funded apiculture program.
BAR has supported UPLB’s apiculture (beekeeping) program as it recognizes that the use of natural products as a way to natural healing has now become a global trend.
BAR Director Nicomedes P. Eleazar said beekeeping can generate livelihood in rural areas where there is hardly any jobs for folks that could also be protectors of farm lands and forests.
The market for it is also the growing, health-conscious individuals.
“We should tap our own local bee species and their by-products that have unique traits so we can market Filipino products that can capture a niche following in the global health and wellness market,” Eleazar said.
Aside from the bees wax, other beekeeping products are honey, pollen, and royal jelly.

                                            please tell me what is the main idea of this article. Its a quantitative research In a recent correspondence, the authors suggested that secondary schools must adhere to health protocols and national and international guidelines so that the delivery of face-to-face classes will not risk students’ and educators’ health. With this, this paper proposes that even in higher education, a well-planned execution of face-to-face classes must be done. Thus, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic. A recent correspondence tackled the adherence of secondary schools to health protocols as a significant factor in the delivery of face-to-face classes, following national and international guidelines in mitigating the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 This article highlights how, in the Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Department of Health have prepared a joint memorandum circular regarding the guidelines on the gradual reopening of limited face-to-face classes of higher education institutions (HEIs). Face-to-face classes are limited to students of medicine and allied health courses. Campuses in areas under general community quarantine and modified general community quarantine are only allowed to reoperate physically with programs on medicine, nursing, medical technology, medical laboratory science, physical therapy, midwifery and public health.2 For students and school staff, bringing of face masks, face shields and other personal hygiene kits, such as ethyl alcohol (70%), hand sanitizer, cleansing wipes/tissue/hand towel and hand soap, is required.2 They are discouraged to buy food outside the campus to avoid physical contact during breaktime periods. They are to eat in their assigned seats inside classrooms with clear partition because they will remove their face masks and face shields while eating and drinking. They are to stay at home when they are symptomatic. Only students who are least 20 years in age are allowed to attend face-to-face classes. For HEIs, collaboration with the local government units is needed, with a presented contingency plan for resumption of the limited physical classes. The maximum number of students should be allowed, provided that a distance of 1.5 m must be observed between each student.2 Moreover, extracurricular activities are banned to avoid mass gatherings. Schools shall re-design the layouts of their facilities to ensure physical distancing.2 Health declaration forms and body temperature are still to be taken at the entrance of the school premises. Another responsibility of the school administrators is to ensure the transparent partition between the faculty and the students while classes are ongoing. School libraries are also open with limited time to encourage students to maximize the use of online library services.2 Also, all school facilities and equipment are to be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Without prior notice, the CHED may order the immediate suspension of any school that will violate health protocols and other provisions prescribed under the circular. This effort of the Philippine government is to augment the number of health workers during this pandemic.3 A youth group in the country, however, clamors that the government must not allow face-to-face classes until the vaccination program takes place,4 which is a hot issue nowadays.5 Ultimately, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic.​</a>

In the middle of this pandemic, people have tried many ways one after another on how to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus as number of infected cases continue to rise. One easy and traditional way that people believe to be effective cure to COVID-19 virus infection is the practice of steam inhalation -locally known as tuob. Rappler.com reported that the employees in Cebu provincial government were instructed to do steam inhalation twice a day at their own workplaces as part of their wellness program. This action serves as their means to battle against the virus. However, this action by the Office of the Governor of Cebu was opposed by WHO Philippines saying that steam inhalation will not prevent one from catching COVID-19. They further elaborated that extremely hot steam can be harmful because of the risk of getting burn injury. Also, they pointed out that science and evidence must be sought in fighting this virus. They clarified that as to date there is no recommended treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 yet. Moreover, they even warned people against self-medicating and using unverified treatments to patients with COVID-19 until there is enough evidence. There is no evidence up to the present time that can attest the efficacy of this inhalation practice in relation to COVID-19.

                            17. WHO lauds PH's COVID-19 vaccination drive, suggests ways to improve (ARTICLE)
Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 25) — Two officials from the World Health Organization on Wednesday highlighted that the Philippines has vaccinated a significant number of vulnerable individuals, but they said there is room for improvement especially at a time when the more contagious Delta variant is spreading.
Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, said he was pleased to hear that at least 95% of healthcare workers in the country and close to 50% of elderly have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
"The government is putting significant effort in vaccinations," he said in a virtual media briefing.
WHO Essential Medicines and Health Technologies coordinator Dr. Socorro Escalante agreed, saying the Philippines has maximized its capacity to rapidly roll out the limited vaccine supply across the country.
"The vaccination rollout in the Philippines is going quite well," she said. "We have seen that they have a good plan of ensuring that when it is made available, they are distributed to the local government units as soon as possible."
The Philippines has fully vaccinated 13.19 million — or 17% of the target population to reach herd immunity — while 17.49 million have received their first dose.
Escalante noted that while several local governments are successfully carrying out their vaccination program, there are some that can still improve in vaccinating the priority sectors. She added local officials should continue to reach out to the remaining healthcare workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities who haven't received their shots yet.
WHO data showed as of August 24, the Philippines had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the Western Pacific Region. It was also the country with the most number of infections recorded on that day, followed by Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
The spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant, insufficient adherence to minimum public health standards, and difficulty in detecting asymptomatic or mild cases are among the reasons behind this, WHO officials said.
Kasai said the Delta variant, which is testing the public health capacity of all nations, is invading households.
"Delta's higher transmissibility means clusters of cases are quickly leading to bigger outbreaks especially in the high-risk settings... We are also seeing more clusters in families. Once the virus enters the household, more family members are quickly becoming infected," he said.

                            23. From a company that imports bee products from the United States through traders, Milea Bath and Body Wellness Essentials is now taking advantage of local resources on bee products manufacturing.
Imported bees wax, used as raw material for natural and organic personal care products cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, costs P 600 to P1,000 per kilo.
The locally-sourced only costs P150 to P400 per kilo.
Department of Agriculture noted the country imported 400 MT of honey (gathered by bees from plant nectars) in 2009 largely from Australia.
Apiservices reported the Philippines’ importation of bee products totaled to more than $1 billion from 1989 until over the last few years. It indicates brisk demand locally for bees’ natural sweetener and related products.
Bees wax is the natural wax that form the bee hive, the octagonal holes, or the house of honeybees.
The bees also produce propolis, a resinous mixture that bees gather from flowers, tree buds and other botanical sources, enabling it to prevent diseases and block off bacterial growth in the hive.
“The propolis is used as protection of bees from other predators. They use it as antiseptic in their hive to increase their immune system, but we can use it for our purpose, for human health protection,” said Dr. Cleofas Cervancia, University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB) project leader for Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR)-funded apiculture program.
BAR has supported UPLB’s apiculture (beekeeping) program as it recognizes that the use of natural products as a way to natural healing has now become a global trend.
BAR Director Nicomedes P. Eleazar said beekeeping can generate livelihood in rural areas where there is hardly any jobs for folks that could also be protectors of farm lands and forests.
The market for it is also the growing, health-conscious individuals.
“We should tap our own local bee species and their by-products that have unique traits so we can market Filipino products that can capture a niche following in the global health and wellness market,” Eleazar said.
Aside from the bees wax, other beekeeping products are honey, pollen, and royal jelly.

On the same day, on the other side of the world at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, WHO activated the highest level of alert by declaring COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. The Philippine government mounted a multi-sectoral response to the COVID-19. through the Interagency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases chaired by the Department of Health (DOH). Through the National Action Plan (NAP) on COVID-19. the government aims to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its socioeconomic impacts.The Philippines implemented various actions including a community quarantine in Metro Manila which expanded to Luzon as well as other parts of the country; expanded its testing capacity from one national reference laboratory with the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) to 23 licensed testing labs across the country; worked towards ensuring that its health care system can handle surge capacity, including for financing of services and management of cases needing isolation, quarantine and hospitalization; and addressed the social and economic impact to the community including by providing social amelioration to low income families. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been working with Ministries of Health worldwide to prepare and respond to COVID-19. In the Philippines, WHO country office in the Philippines and its partners have been working with the Department of Health and subnational authorities to respond to the pandemic. The country level response is done with support from the WHO regional office and headquarters.(2020, World Health Organization)​</h2><br />

                            30. please tell me what is the main idea of this article. Its a quantitative research In a recent correspondence, the authors suggested that secondary schools must adhere to health protocols and national and international guidelines so that the delivery of face-to-face classes will not risk students’ and educators’ health. With this, this paper proposes that even in higher education, a well-planned execution of face-to-face classes must be done. Thus, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic. A recent correspondence tackled the adherence of secondary schools to health protocols as a significant factor in the delivery of face-to-face classes, following national and international guidelines in mitigating the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 This article highlights how, in the Philippines, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Department of Health have prepared a joint memorandum circular regarding the guidelines on the gradual reopening of limited face-to-face classes of higher education institutions (HEIs). Face-to-face classes are limited to students of medicine and allied health courses. Campuses in areas under general community quarantine and modified general community quarantine are only allowed to reoperate physically with programs on medicine, nursing, medical technology, medical laboratory science, physical therapy, midwifery and public health.2 For students and school staff, bringing of face masks, face shields and other personal hygiene kits, such as ethyl alcohol (70%), hand sanitizer, cleansing wipes/tissue/hand towel and hand soap, is required.2 They are discouraged to buy food outside the campus to avoid physical contact during breaktime periods. They are to eat in their assigned seats inside classrooms with clear partition because they will remove their face masks and face shields while eating and drinking. They are to stay at home when they are symptomatic. Only students who are least 20 years in age are allowed to attend face-to-face classes. For HEIs, collaboration with the local government units is needed, with a presented contingency plan for resumption of the limited physical classes. The maximum number of students should be allowed, provided that a distance of 1.5 m must be observed between each student.2 Moreover, extracurricular activities are banned to avoid mass gatherings. Schools shall re-design the layouts of their facilities to ensure physical distancing.2 Health declaration forms and body temperature are still to be taken at the entrance of the school premises. Another responsibility of the school administrators is to ensure the transparent partition between the faculty and the students while classes are ongoing. School libraries are also open with limited time to encourage students to maximize the use of online library services.2 Also, all school facilities and equipment are to be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Without prior notice, the CHED may order the immediate suspension of any school that will violate health protocols and other provisions prescribed under the circular. This effort of the Philippine government is to augment the number of health workers during this pandemic.3 A youth group in the country, however, clamors that the government must not allow face-to-face classes until the vaccination program takes place,4 which is a hot issue nowadays.5 Ultimately, the gradual reopening of face-to-face classes becomes a necessity in order to gain a sense of normalcy in the middle of a pandemic.​</h2><br />
