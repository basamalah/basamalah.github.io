                                            Sound is a type of energy made by vibrations. When anyobject vibrates, it causes movement in the air particles. Theseparticles bump into the particles close to them, which makesthem vibrate too causing them to burnp into more air particles.This movement, called sound waves, keeps going until they runout of energy. If your ear is within range of the vibrations, youhear the sound.Picture a stone thrown into a still body of water or a drop ofwater was dropped into a still basin filled with water. The ringsof waves expand indefinitely until the water becomes calm orstill again. The same is true with sound. When the vibrationsare fast, you hear a loud sound. When the vibrations are slow,it creates a soft sound.1.What sounds of nature are mentioned in the chant:?Can you add more sounds in the list?2.What types of sounds are these?

<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Sound wave</strong> is an energy produce by vibration which move in compressional longitudinal wave. Sound wave is also a mechanical wave in which it needs a medium in order to propagate. It can travel in air, water, and solid medium. The more compact the particle of the medium, the faster the sound wave will travel which means sound wave travels faster in solid and travel slowest in gas medium.
</p><p>
<strong>Sound wave</strong> will not propagate in vacuum or in the outer space making the outer space very quite since no sound will be able to produce there.
</p><p>
<strong>Sound wave</strong> travel slowest in the solid media since the particle are more dense and compressed compared to liquid and to air and the more compact and dense the media, the faster the sound travel.

                            12. Sound is a type of energy made by vibrations. When anyobject vibrates, it causes movement in the air particles. Theseparticles bump into the particles close to them, which makesthem vibrate too causing them to burnp into more air particles.This movement, called sound waves, keeps going until they runout of energy. If your ear is within range of the vibrations, youhear the sound.Picture a stone thrown into a still body of water or a drop ofwater was dropped into a still basin filled with water. The ringsof waves expand indefinitely until the water becomes calm orstill again. The same is true with sound. When the vibrationsare fast, you hear a loud sound. When the vibrations are slow,it creates a soft sound.1.What sounds of nature are mentioned in the chant:?Can you add more sounds in the list?2.What types of sounds are these?
