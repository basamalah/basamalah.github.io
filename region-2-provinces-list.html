The vast output of our serious composers, who ironically are mostly Manila-based, is also unknown to them. There is a pressing need to bring Philippine music closer to our people: strong identification of our own music is one vital factor in bringing our people together or unifying the nation. Exposing Filipinos to their own musical traditions is properly the task of the government, our music educators, musicologists, community leaders, concerned media practitioners, performing groups, pro-Filipino radio and television stations and recording companies, heritage centers and libraries, and cultural organizations all over the country, As a student, you are given the task to perform music of Luzon by choosing one of the following activities listed below that you think you can do alone with confidence. 1.
