                                            True or False1. The firm tries to improve short-run marketing policy planning to tie together its activities during the sales era.2. The marketing concept means that a firm emphasizes making a profit above all other objectives.3. A firm is said to be production oriented if it makes products which are easy to produce and then tries to sell them.4. The difference that a customer sees between the benefits of a firm's offering and the costs of obtaining those benefits is called customer value.5. Strategic planning is the managerial process of developing and maintaining a match between an organization's resources and its market opportunities.6. A marketing strategy is composed of two interrelated parts, a target market and a marketing mix.7. The "four Ps" of the marketing mix are people, products, price and promotion.8. Product, place, promotion, price are the four major variables in a firm's marketing mix.9. Although the customer should be the target of all marketing efforts, customers are not part of a marketing mix.10. The product area of the marketing mix may involve a service and/or a physical good which satisfies some customer's needs.11. The place area is concerned with getting the right market to the target market.12. Attractive opportunities for a particular firm are those that the firm has some chance of doing something about given its resources and objectives.13. Finding "competitive advantages" is important because they are needed for survival in increasingly competitive markets.14. A good S.W.O.T. analysis helps a manager focus on a strategy that takes advantages of the firm's opportunities and strengths while avoiding its weaknesses and threats to its success.15. A market is a group of sellers who offer substitute ways of satisfying customer needs.​</a>
