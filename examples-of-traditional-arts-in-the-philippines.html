Expound the given statement:“Any form of art is a form of power”pa help po, advance thank you. need now​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The essence of art in today's society is multifaceted and can vary depending on the context and perspective. </p><p></p><p>2. It is important to walk through the arts in history and arts through the ages for several reasons. Firstly, art is a reflection of society and culture, and therefore, studying the art of different time periods and regions can provide insights into the values, beliefs, and practices of those societies. This can help us to better understand the historical context in which art was created and appreciate its significance.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, studying art through the ages can help us to trace the development and evolution of different artistic movements, styles, and techniques. This can provide us with a better understanding of how art has changed and adapted over time, and how it has been influenced by various factors such as politics, religion, and technology.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by understanding the artistic practices and traditions of the past, contemporary artists can draw inspiration from historical sources and engage in a dialogue with the past. This can help to create a deeper understanding of contemporary art, and the connections and influences that exist between contemporary art and the art of the past.</p><p></p><p>In short, by studying the arts in history and arts through the ages, we can gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of art, and its significance in both historical and contemporary contexts. This can help us to better appreciate and engage with contemporary art, and to understand the ways in which it is both shaped by and in conversation with the past.</p><p></p><p>3. Traditional art and contemporary art are two broad categories of art that differ in various ways. Here are some comparisons between the two:</p><p></p><p>1. Historical context: Traditional art is usually associated with historical or cultural traditions, whereas contemporary art is often seen as breaking away from these traditions and exploring new forms of expression.</p><p></p><p>Example: Traditional Japanese woodblock prints, such as the works of Hokusai or Hiroshige, are known for their detailed imagery and connection to Japanese culture and history. On the other hand, contemporary Japanese artist Takashi Murakami's works often blend traditional and modern elements to create bold and colorful images that reflect contemporary pop culture.</p><p></p><p>2. Materials and techniques: Traditional art often uses specific materials and techniques that have been used for centuries, whereas contemporary art often incorporates new materials and technology.</p><p></p><p>Example: Traditional Chinese calligraphy uses brushes, ink, and rice paper, and emphasizes the importance of mastery and discipline in technique. In contrast, contemporary artist Xu Bing's installation "Book from the Sky" features scrolls of Chinese text that are actually meaningless, and are created using a specially designed printer and characters that he invented himself.</p><p></p><p>3. Purpose and meaning: Traditional art often has specific meanings or functions within a cultural context, whereas contemporary art often challenges traditional notions of meaning and interpretation.</p><p></p><p>Example: Traditional African masks were often used in rituals and ceremonies to communicate with the spirit world, and were made from natural materials such as wood, animal skins, and beads. In contrast, contemporary South African artist William Kentridge's works often deal with themes of apartheid and social justice, and use a variety of media such as film, drawing, and sculpture to create thought-provoking narratives.</p><br />

</p><p>5. Ethnic arts in the Philippines manifest love and patience.
</p><p>Answer: manifest​- adjective</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>An adverb</strong> is a word that modifies (describes) a verb (he sings loudly), an adjective (very tall), another adverb (ended too quickly), or even a whole sentence (Fortunately, I had brought an umbrella). Adverbs often end in -ly, but some (such as fast) look exactly the same as their adjective counterparts.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Verbs </strong>are words that show an action (sing), occurrence (develop), or state of being (exist). Almost every sentence requires a verb. The basic form of a verb is known as its infinitive. The forms call, love, break, and go are all infinitives. Almost all verbs have two other important forms called participles.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong> Adjectives</strong> are words that describe the qualities or states of being of nouns: enormous, doglike, silly, yellow, fun, fast. They can also describe the quantity of nouns: many, few, millions, eleven.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST!</p><br />

(The literature of this region is treated in separate articles on Chinese literature, Korean literature, and Japanese literature.) Some studies of East Asia also include the cultures of the Indochinese peninsula and adjoining islands, as well as Mongolia to the north. The logic of this occasional inclusion is based on a strict geographic definition as well as a recognition of common bonds forged through the acceptance of Buddhism by many of these cultures.
