Filipino psychology, or Sikolohiyang Pilipino, in Filipino, is defined as the psychology rooted on the experience, ideas, and cultural orientation of the Filipinos. 2. Filipino Psychology emerged and grew as part of the nationalist indigenization movement in the Philippines that was formalized in 1975. 3. The roots of Filipino Psychology can be traced back to the introduction of the American education system in the Philippines. Agustin Alonzo was among the first Filipino psychologists to return from their education in America (in 1925) to teach at the College of Education in the University of the Philippines. 4. During the 1960s, many Filipino intellectuals and scholars were already aware of the limitations and incompatibility of Western Psychology; western-oriented approaches in research in particular, had led scholars to paint the Filipino through the “judgmental and impressionistic views of the colonizers.5. It is with the use of American categories and standards that "the native Filipino invariably suffers from the comparison in not too subtle attempts to put forward Western behavior patterns as models for the Filipino."6. Early efforts to correct the traditional way of teaching and studying psychology in the 1960s include the translation of foreign materials and the use of the Filipino language as a mode of instruction, however, these efforts fail to address the problems brought about by colonial psychology as these efforts were sparse and not collaborated upon by psychologists. 7. It was only in the 1970s that a concerted effort to address colonial psychology in the form of Filipin Psychology took place. Filipino Psychology, along with advances in Filipinology and similarly History's Pantayong Pananaw, was led by Virgilio Enriquez, Prospero Covar, and Zeus A. Salazar in the indigenization movement of their respective fields. 8. Kapwa is the core construct of Filipino Psychology. Kapwa has two categories, Ibang Tao and Hindi Ibang Tao. Core value or Kapwa (Shared inner self) 9. (Pivotal interpersonal value) Pakiramdam: Shared inner perceptions. Filipinos use damdam, or the inner perception of others' emotions, as a basic tool to guide their dealings with other people. 10.(Societal Values) Karangalan: Loosely translated to dignity, this actually refers to what other people see in a person and how they use that information to make a stand or judge about his/her worth.​</a>

This sct of instructional materials is based the philosophy objectives, and list of learning competencies of the K to 12 curricula by the Department of Education The first topic of Western classical music history as understood traditionally begins with plainchant (also called "Gregorian" chant), the vocal religious practice of the Roman Catholic Church from the Medieval Period. The Renaissance's grandest, most highly valued works of vocal music were polyphonic settings of the Ordinary of the Mass'. The Ordinary Mass is composed of five texts --Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (the first words of the texts) that were included in every Mass, not only in Masses that celebrated special occasions. The Baroque era of Western classical music is usually defined as the period from 1600 to 1750. Two stylistic tendencies that partially define the Baroque where there is an increased interest in the solo voice and a rise in the status of instruments and instrumental music.

                                            Television and childrenTelevision has become an integral part of a child's life. For the last thirty years, it has been transforming people'slives. It has an effect on almost every aspect of modern life. Although television may be used to educate children, programswith little or no educational value are commonly on broadcast.Experts are disturbed about the viewpoint that children are learning from television, typically, parents, classrooms,and churches have served as role models and educators for children.Since television has such a strong impact on children's attitudes and behavior, its presence in culture is growing inimportance - it is much more than a mere leisure practice. According to child psychologist Robert M. Liebert "the tool haschanged childhood more than any other psychological breakthrough in the history of the world."Another effect on media is extreme violence exposure. Children can become more violent as a result of watchingtelevision crime, according to many reports. Furthermore, when children are exposed to so much abuse on ty, they growused to it as the only alternative to tough circumstances. Children who are exposed to a lot of violence on TV may developapathy toward real aggression.A study conducted by Ronald S. Drabman has shown that compared to a control group, children who watched anaggressive television broadcast were slower to ask for adult help when a fight broke out among younger children.Children are probably influenced by clever ads directed at them. Dr. Dale Roeck claims that exposing children totoo much high-powered ads of sugar-rich products on tv puts their oral wellbeing at risk which, of course, has a detrimentalimpact on good diet."Almost half of the items that television sells to kids are products that people who care for kids believe shouldn't bepurchased in the first place," according to another expert Kids who are very young do not know the difference betweenadvertisements and programmes.1.What is the claim of the author?2.Write three effects of television to the children3.Does the reasoning of the author sound or valid? Why or Why not?​</a>

Filipino psychology, or Sikolohiyang Pilipino, in Filipino, is defined as the psychology rooted on the experience, ideas, and cultural orientation of the Filipinos. 2. Filipino Psychology emerged and grew as part of the nationalist indigenization movement in the Philippines that was formalized in 1975. 3. The roots of Filipino Psychology can be traced back to the introduction of the American education system in the Philippines. Agustin Alonzo was among the first Filipino psychologists to return from their education in America (in 1925) to teach at the College of Education in the University of the Philippines. 4. During the 1960s, many Filipino intellectuals and scholars were already aware of the limitations and incompatibility of Western Psychology; western-oriented approaches in research in particular, had led scholars to paint the Filipino through the “judgmental and impressionistic views of the colonizers.5. It is with the use of American categories and standards that "the native Filipino invariably suffers from the comparison in not too subtle attempts to put forward Western behavior patterns as models for the Filipino."6. Early efforts to correct the traditional way of teaching and studying psychology in the 1960s include the translation of foreign materials and the use of the Filipino language as a mode of instruction, however, these efforts fail to address the problems brought about by colonial psychology as these efforts were sparse and not collaborated upon by psychologists. 7. It was only in the 1970s that a concerted effort to address colonial psychology in the form of Filipin Psychology took place. Filipino Psychology, along with advances in Filipinology and similarly History's Pantayong Pananaw, was led by Virgilio Enriquez, Prospero Covar, and Zeus A. Salazar in the indigenization movement of their respective fields. 8. Kapwa is the core construct of Filipino Psychology. Kapwa has two categories, Ibang Tao and Hindi Ibang Tao.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Baybayin (Tagalog pronunciation: [baɪbaˈjɪn], pre-kudlit: ᜊᜊᜌᜒ, virama-krus-kudlit: ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔, virama-pamudpod: ᜊᜌ᜴ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜴; also incorrectly known as alibata) is a Philippine script. The script is an alphasyllabary belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. It was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries before being supplanted by the Latin alphabet during the period of Spanish colonization. It was used in Tagalog and to a lesser extent Kapampangan speaking areas; its use spread to Ilokanos in the early 17th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, baybayin survived and evolved into multiple forms—the Tagbanwa script of Palawan, and the Hanuno'o and Buhid scripts of Mindoro—and was used to create the constructed modern Kulitan script of the Kapampangan and the Ibalnan script of the Palawan tribe.[citation needed]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

The Renaissance's grandest, most highly valued works of vocal music were polyphonic settings of the Ordinary of the Mass'. The Ordinary Mass is composed of five texts --Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (the first words of the texts) that were included in every Mass, not only in Masses that celebrated special occasions. The Baroque era of Western classical music is usually defined as the period from 1600 to 1750. Two stylistic tendencies that partially define the Baroque where there is an increased interest in the solo voice and a rise in the status of instruments and instrumental music.

                            29. Television and childrenTelevision has become an integral part of a child's life. For the last thirty years, it has been transforming people'slives. It has an effect on almost every aspect of modern life. Although television may be used to educate children, programswith little or no educational value are commonly on broadcast.Experts are disturbed about the viewpoint that children are learning from television, typically, parents, classrooms,and churches have served as role models and educators for children.Since television has such a strong impact on children's attitudes and behavior, its presence in culture is growing inimportance - it is much more than a mere leisure practice. According to child psychologist Robert M. Liebert "the tool haschanged childhood more than any other psychological breakthrough in the history of the world."Another effect on media is extreme violence exposure. Children can become more violent as a result of watchingtelevision crime, according to many reports. Furthermore, when children are exposed to so much abuse on ty, they growused to it as the only alternative to tough circumstances. Children who are exposed to a lot of violence on TV may developapathy toward real aggression.A study conducted by Ronald S. Drabman has shown that compared to a control group, children who watched anaggressive television broadcast were slower to ask for adult help when a fight broke out among younger children.Children are probably influenced by clever ads directed at them. Dr. Dale Roeck claims that exposing children totoo much high-powered ads of sugar-rich products on tv puts their oral wellbeing at risk which, of course, has a detrimentalimpact on good diet."Almost half of the items that television sells to kids are products that people who care for kids believe shouldn't bepurchased in the first place," according to another expert Kids who are very young do not know the difference betweenadvertisements and programmes.1.What is the claim of the author?2.Write three effects of television to the children3.Does the reasoning of the author sound or valid?
