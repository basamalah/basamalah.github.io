Studies show that employees who have mutually respectful relationships with their employers are more likely to be happy, loyal and productive in the long-run.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Heightened Employee Loyalty</p><p>Employees don’t leave their jobs, they leave their bosses.</p><p></p><p>Most employees don’t think twice about changing their jobs if they feel the work culture is not feasible. This mainly happens when employers overlook their stand for bettering ties with the workforce.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the chances to improve employee relations not only cost the employers financially. But it also tarnished their brand image, thereby, obstructing the flow of new talents.</p><p></p><p>Thus, employers must always keep a check on how their employees feel and if their career is advancing</p><p></p><p>2.

This allows employers to make unbiased decisions involving their workforce. Thus, lowering the chances of any conflict within the organization.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The employment relationship is the legal link between employers and employees. It exists when a person performs work or services under certain conditions in return for remuneration.</p><p></p><p>It is through the employment relationship, however defined, that reciprocal rights and obligations are created between the employee and the employer. It has been, and continues to be, the main vehicle through which workers gain access to the rights and benefits associated with employment in the areas of labour law and social security. The existence of an employment relationship is the condition that determines the application of the labour and social security law provisions addressed to employees. It is the key point of reference for determining the nature and extent of employers' rights and obligations towards their workers.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>:)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) Don’t Micromanage, when you micromanage, you make your employees feel like they can’t do their job. That has a negative effect on their productivity and confidence.</p><p>One of the easiest ways to give your team members a modicum of control is to let them schedule their own work hours. Software like Sling allows you, the manager, to set up the schedule so that your employees can choose when they want to work.</p><p>2.Maintain An Open-Door Policy, a great way to begin building your employee/employer relations is by maintaining an open-door policy. When your team members feel comfortable approaching you with questions, concerns, and new ideas, a natural give-and-take develops. That then serves to strengthen your employee/employer relations.</p><p>3.Communicate With Your Employees Face-To-Face,Don’t let your reliance on digital communication like email, texting, instant messaging, and webcams get in the way of face-to-face, in-person communication. Talk to your employees directly. Give them assignments personally rather than just through email.</p><p>Engage your team members in personal conversations to find out how they’re doing. When you’re physically present in your team members’ lives, your relationship will improve.</p><p>4.Conduct Performance Reviews, performance reviews may not sound like a way to build strong employee/employer relations, but, done right, they can forge a bond between you and your team that will inspire them to greatness.</p><p>Schedule performance reviews at least every six months (once a quarter is even better). During these reviews, try to focus on the positive rather than always spotlighting the negative.</p><p>5.Delegate ,when you delegate, you give employees the opportunity to get a feel for your responsibilities. This serves to teach them about what goes on in the business around them, and it helps you all understand where the team’s strengths and weaknesses lie.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            27. Give the four-fold test to determine employer-employee relationship and please explain each</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(1) the selection and engagement of the employee; </p><p>Selection and engagement refers to the "choice" of the employer to hire the services of a worker and his commitment to keep the latter as his employee.</p><p></p><p>(2) the payment of wages; </p><p>A wage is compensation paid to employees for work for a company during a period of time</p><p></p><p>(3) the power of dismissal; </p><p>Dismissal is when the employer chooses to require the employee to leave, generally for a reason which is the fault of the employee. In the case of the dismissal of an employee, the contract ends without notice and severance pay.</p><p></p><p>(4) the power to control the employee's conduct, or the so-called "control test."</p><p>The common law control test is the basic test, using the common law rules, for determining whether a relationship exists between the worker and the person or firm that they work for. Under the common-law test, the employer has the right to tell the employee what to do, how, when, and where to do the job.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Contrary to respondent's submission, which was upheld by the CA, the Court agrees with the labor tribunals that all the four (4) elements are present in this case:
</p><p>
</p><p>First. It is undisputed that respondent hired petitioner to work as a truck driver for his private enterprise, GPT.
</p><p>
</p><p>Second. Petitioner received compensation from respondent for the services he rendered. Contrary to the findings of the CA, while the wages paid was determined on a "per trip" or commission basis, it has been constantly ruled that such does not negate employment relationship. Article 97 of the Labor Code broadly defines the term "wage" as "the remuneration or earnings, however designated, capable of being expressed in terms of money, whether fixed or ascertained on a time, task, piece, or commission basis, or other method of calculating the same, which is payable by an employer to an employee under a written or unwritten contract of employment for work done or to be done, or for services rendered or to be rendered x x x." That petitioner was paid on a "per trip" or commission basis is insignificant as this is merely a method of computing compensation and not a basis for determining the existence or absence of an employer­-employee relationship.
</p><p>
</p><p>Third. Respondent's power to dismiss was inherent in the selection and engagement of petitioner as truck driver.
</p><p>
</p><p>Fourth. The presence of the element of control, which is the most important element to determine the existence or absence of employment relationship, can be safely deduced from the fact that: (a) respondent owned the trucks that were assigned to petitioner; (b) the cargoes loaded in the said trucks were exclusively for respondent's clients; and (c) the schedule and route to be followed by petitioner were exclusively determined by respondent. The latter's claim that petitioner was permitted to render service to other companies was not substantiated and there was no showing that he indeed worked as truck driver for other companies. Given all these considerations, while petitioner was free to carry out his duties as truck driver, it cannot be pretended that respondent, nonetheless, exercised control over the means and methods by which the former was to accomplish his work. To reiterate, the power of control refers merely to the existence of the power. It is not essential for the employer to actually supervise the performance of duties of the employee, as it is sufficient that the former has a right to wield the power, as in this case.
