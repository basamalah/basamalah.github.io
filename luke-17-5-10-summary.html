                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Word of God
</p><p>The seventy returned with joy, saying, 'Lord, in your name even the demons submit to us!' He said to them, 'I watched Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. See, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.'
</p><p>Jesus Rejoices At that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, 'I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.'
</p><p>Then turning to the disciples, Jesus said to them privately, 'Blessed are the eyes that see what you see! For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.'

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>7 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p><p></p><p>2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p><p></p><p>3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p><p></p><p>4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p><p></p><p>5 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p><p></p><p>6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p><p></p><p>7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p><p></p><p>8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p><p></p><p>9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p><p></p><p>10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p><p></p><p>11 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p><p></p><p>12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p><p></p><p>13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p><p></p><p>14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p><p></p><p>15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p><p></p><p>16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p><p></p><p>17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p><p></p><p>18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p><p></p><p>19 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p><p></p><p>20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p><p></p><p>21 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</p><p></p><p>22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p><p></p><p>23 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p><p></p><p>24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p><p></p><p>25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?

                        <p>Summary of Luke 5:1-11 states that there was once a group of fishermen who have been trying to catch fish the whole night but they are not able to catch anything. Jesus commanded them to put their nets on the deep water but Simon doubted about Jesus command but he said "because you said so Lord, I will let down the nets. He put down the nets and in their surprised they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. The moral of this lesson is that nothing is impossible with Jesus Christ. He can do all things what we need to do is just to trust everything to him. </p><br />

                            24. reflection about luke 6:17 -26​</h2><br />
                        <p>Today we begin what is known as Luke’s ‘Sermon on the Plain’ which more or less parallels Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount. Luke’s is much shorter but both begin with the Beatitudes and end with the parable of the house builders. Some of what is found in Matthew’s Sermon is found elsewhere in Luke as Matthew’s ‘Sermon’ it consists of disparate sayings of Jesus gathered into one place. Luke also omits Matthew’s specifically Jewish material which would not have been relevant to his Gentile readers.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Sermon can be summarised as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>An introduction of blessings and woes (20-26)
</p><p>
</p><p>The love of one’s enemies (27-36)
</p><p>
</p><p>The demands of loving one’s neighbour (37-42)
</p><p>
</p><p>Good deeds as proof of one’s goodness (43-45)
</p><p>
</p><p>A parable on listening to and acting on the words of Jesus (46-49).
</p><p>
</p><p>Similar to Matthew’s Sermon on the Mount, Luke begins the Sermon on the Plain with his version of the Beatitudes. But there are striking differences. Whereas Matthew has eight (some would say seven) Beatitudes, Luke has four “Blesseds” and four contrasting “Woes”. As is typical of his uncompromising style when it comes to following Jesus, the language of Luke is much more direct and hard-hitting and it may well be closer to what Jesus actually said.
</p><p>
</p><p>Matthew’s Beatitudes propose a set of attitudes which reflect the spirit of the Kingdom, qualities to be found in the truly Christian and human life. Luke, on the other hand, speaks of material conditions in this life which will be overturned. Later in this gospel, this is illustrated graphically in the story of the rich man and Lazarus (16:25).
</p><p>
</p><p>Luke also has Jesus speak in the second person: “Blessed are you” and “Woe to you” rather than in the third person as Matthew does (“Blessed are those who…”). Nor does he speak of the “poor in spirit” but of “you who are poor” and he certainly means the materially poor.
</p><p>
</p><p>He goes on to say how blessed too are “you who are hungry; you who weep; you who are hated and who are rejected and marginalised and whose name is regarded as evil” because of their connection with Jesus. Undoubtedly Matthew’s Beatitudes can be read to consider just ‘spiritual’ poverty and a hunger for ‘righteousness’, which in fact are also a form of real poverty and real hunger but Luke is a gospel for the materially poor and distressed and we must be careful not to turn our focus away from them. That is why he has Jesus born in poverty and dying naked and destitute (even of his ‘friends’).
</p><p>
</p><p>Jesus tells those who are poor and hungry and abused to rejoice when that happens and “dance for joy”. There are two reasons:
</p><p>
</p><p>because their reward will be “great in heaven” and
</p><p>
</p><p>because that is the way the prophets in the past were treated (and the way Jesus the Prophet will also be treated).
</p><p>
</p><p>At a first reading, it seems like a classical example of religion as the ‘opium of the people’: Be happy that you are having such a hard time now because there is a wonderful future waiting for you in the next world. It was the message that Karl Marx mocked the capitalist-ruled churches of preaching to the exploited ‘proletariat’.
</p><p>
</p><p>And the second part is not likely to go down well in our contemporary developed world. “”Woe to you who are rich [he can’t be serious!], you have received your comfort already.” “Woe to you who are full, because you will be hungry; woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep; woe to you who are spoken well of. That is how they treated the false prophets.”
</p><p>
</p><p>How are we to understand these sayings which turn our common worldview upside down? I think they have to be seen in the light of the Kingdom, in the kind of society that Jesus came to set up, a society based on mutual love and sharing and support. A Kingdom for this world and not just the next. The coming of such a society could only be good news for the poor and destitute (material and otherwise), for those suffering from hunger (physical and otherwise), for those depressed by deep sorrow and for those abused and rejected for their commitment to Jesus and his Way.
</p><p>
</p><p>On the other hand it would not be good news for those self-focused people who amass material wealth at the expense of others, who indulge in excessive consumption of the world’s goods, who live lives centred on personal hedonism and pleasure, and who feed off the envy and adulation of those around them. There is really no place for such people in the Kingdom. To enter fully into the Kingdom they have to unload all these concerns and obsessions and let go. Instead of focusing on what they can get; they will focus on what they can share of what they have.
</p><p>
</p><p>A clear example is of the rich young man in the Gospel. How rich he was – and yet how sad he was! Compare him with Zacchaeus, whom we will be meeting later on.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Luke 16:10 states, "One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much."</p><p></p><p>This verse highlights the importance of integrity and the connection between small actions and larger character traits. It suggests that a person's trustworthiness and honesty in small matters can indicate their behavior in larger, more significant situations.</p><p></p><p>In a spiritual context, this verse can be interpreted as a reminder that how we handle the blessings and responsibilities given to us, no matter how small they may seem, reflects our relationship with God and our commitment to living a righteous life.</p><p></p><p>In summary, Luke 16:10 is a call to be faithful and honest in all aspects of our lives, big or small, and to cultivate a character of integrity and responsibility.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>(see explanation) </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Here is Luke 17:1-6 from NIV</p><p>1 Jesus said to his disciples: “Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come.</p><p>2 It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.</p><p></p><p>3 So watch yourselves.“If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them. </p><p></p><p>4 Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.”</p><p></p><p>5 The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”</p><p></p><p>6 He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Before this chapter, Jesus emphasized and taught about two things, the <strong>tendency to sin</strong>, and <strong>reconciliation with the Lord</strong>. </p><p></p><p>Humans are always prone to sin and Jesus says that it is frowned upon if you caused others to sin. That is because of promoting sin. You spread sin as how the devil works when you cause another person to sin. That makes you <strong>less desirable</strong> and it would be better to not influence others to sin. He had several account about the pharisees guilty of this act and that's why the pharisees want to get rid of Jesus.</p><p></p><p><strong>Forgiving others</strong> is also viewed the same way. It is better to not hold grudges, but tell them what did was wrong so that they won't do it again. This encourages them to not sin which is in line with what Jesus told about others causing another person to sin earlier. He also said to forgive others because the Lord also forgives no matter what, as Jesus told about the parable of the Prodigal son, lost sheep, lost coin, etc. from previous chapters. All you have to do is to ask for forgivness, and forgive others as well.</p><p></p><p>Faith is also one thing that the apostles and the people are lacking. They were asking Jesus to increase their faith, but Jesus reiterates that faith is something <strong>He cannot impose others; </strong>rather it depends on the apostles and the people. </p><p></p><p></p><p>To learn more about faith, click here:</p><p>brainly.ph/question/346466 </p><br />

                            30. Summary of Luke 4:21-30 and with 2-3 sentence reflection</h2><br />
                        <p>This is a <strong>summary of Luke 4:21-30</strong>. It is the shorter version of the Bible verses. To know the whole story, you can also read from <strong>Luke 4:16-30 summary </strong>or <strong>Luke 4:16-30 commentary</strong>.</p><p>Then He (Jesus) began to say to them, "Today, this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing." All spoke well of Him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from His mouth. </p><p>They said, "Is not this Joseph's son?" He said to them, "Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, 'Doctor, cure yourself!' And you will say, 'Do here also in your hometown the things that we have heard you did at Capernaum.'" And He said, "Truly I tell you, <strong>no prophet is accepted in the prophet's hometown</strong>. But the truth is, there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a severe famine over all the land; yet Elijah was sent to none of them except to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon. There were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian." </p><p>When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with rage. They got up, drove Him out of the town, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they might hurl Him off the cliff. But He passed through the midst of them and went on his way.</p><p>Here is the reflection. This was based from various <strong>Luke 4:21-30 sermons.</strong></p><p>In these bible verses, Jesus preached in His hometown after coming back from His miraculous journey with His disciples. The people doubted His works and tried to asked Him to perform the same miracles that He did to other places. But Jesus already knew what they were thinking and so He said, and I quote, <strong>"No prophet is accepted in the prophet's hometown". </strong>Since the people saw how Jesus grew up, who His parents and family members were, they cannot believe that He became a famous and powerful person. Perhaps, Jesus wanted the people of Nazareth to purify their hearts and faith to be able to believe in the wonders of the Lord. His message might be that the Lord will do His part but He wants us to play our part as well.</p><p>For more reflections from different bible verses, you can go to these pages: </p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1232380</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/1801125</strong></p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2065517</strong></p><br />
