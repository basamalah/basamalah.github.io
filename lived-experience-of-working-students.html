                                            Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the lived experiences and struggles of 22, on-campus working students of ISAT U-Miagao Campus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants' dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helping these students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.tittle:author/s: kind:strength:Weakness:importance:pahelp naman sa pr1 namin huhu​</a>

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>My physical and emotional health suffered but my grades did not. Focusing on my studies gave me a visible sign of success. I needed something I could control and grades provided that for me. The research perspective I learned in classes also made me feel more in control at doctor and therapy appointments. Around Finn's third birthday, he reached age level on all developmental and physical tasks. I transitioned from being a caregiver to "just" a parent. The shift was profound. It had a significant impact on my lived experience as a parent, my lived experience as a student, and my lived experience of health. The worry that consumed me, and the exhaustion I felt as a caregiver dissipated when my role was reduced to parent. I was able to focus on my studies in a more balanced way and I had the energy to build relationships with fellow students in my program. I have the benefit of understanding the experience of being a student as both a caregiver and as a non-cargegiver. My personal experience as a student caregiver, combined with my academic path in student affairs, sowed the seeds for this phenomenological study</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps, make me as a brainliest</p><br />

                            25. Using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method, this study explored the lived experiences and struggles of 22, on-campus working students of ISAT U-Miagao Campus. This study utilized a researcher-constructed questionnaire and interview in gathering information about their experiences and related variables. Frequency count, percentage, mean, and chi-square were used as statistical tools. Results revealed that financial problem was the main factor that motivated the students to work on-campus. They experienced varied feelings as happiness, sadness, annoyance, and worry. Despite work pressure, working students had good time management both for studies and work, with high self-esteem and good academic performance. The study concluded that participants' dual roles in the college as full time student and worker, do not seem to affect their self-esteem and academic performance, however, there is a need to consider helping these students, especially on their financial needs for them to finish their studies.tittle:author/s: kind:strength:Weakness:importance:pahelp naman sa pr1 namin huhu​</h2><br />

The study applied the descriptive and the analytical methods beside the statistical tools so as to achieve the desired goals. Therefore, the researchers used both questionnaire for teachers (31teachers) and test for students (25 students), and he reached the results below: 1. Most of the Sudanese students at secondary school are not acquainted with parts of speech. 2. The periods allocated for writing skills are extremely rare. 3. Teachers, encouragement for students concerning writing skills is entirely rare. 4. There is a complete absence in teaching lessons of English structure. 5.
