                        Philippine literature:<br />Philippine literature is typified by Ladino poems and the religious and secular dramas held on various religious holidays or following someone's death. It is heavily influenced by the arrival of the Spanish in 1565. Philippine literature was primarily oral in nature as most written literature was destroyed.<br />Japanese literature:<br />Japanese literature spans a period of almost two millennia and comprises one of the major literatures in the world, comparable to English literature in age and scope. It comprises a number of genres, including novels, poetry, and drama, travelogues, personal diaries and collections of random thoughts and impressions. From the early seventh century until the present there has never been a period when literature was not being produced by Japanese authors. Japan adopted its writing system from China, often using Chinese characters to represent Japanese words with similar phonetic sounds. Early works were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China and Chinese literature, and was often written in Classical Chinese. Though the Japanese writing system was adapted from Chinese, the two languages are unrelated. The rich emotional vocabulary of the Japanese language gave rise to a refined sensitivity of expression, while Chinese was often used to write about more intellectual and abstract concepts such as morality and justice. The nature of the spoken Japanese language, in which all words end with a simple vowel and stress accents do not exist, shaped the development of poetic forms which were relatively short in length and defined by the numbers of syllables in each line; and which sought above all for precise expression and rich literary allusion. Official court patronage of poetry produced strict artistic codes which dictated the vocabulary and form which could be used for poetic expression. Prose emphasized the smooth transition from one statement to another, rather than organization according to a formal theme.<br />

                            9. what is the biggest contribution of the japanese period in the philippine literature</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippines were occupied by Japan during WWII, which produced many long lasting effects, both good and bad, on Filipino literature. Writing in Tagalog, the native Philippine language, was greatly encouraged, while writing in English was severely limited and often forbidden altogether. Furthermore, there was no freedom of speech or press, and censorship was widely practiced.</p><p></p><p>During WWII, Filipinos were forced to learn Japanese, so the Tagalog language began to incorporate Japanese slang and idioms in its vocabulary and literature. The Japanese form of poetry, Haiku, was also explored by Filipino writers during the occupation. Additionally, short stories came more into fashion. Since writing in English was severely limited by the Japanese regime, the vernacular Tagalog language became more widely utilized in literature. This exploration lasted beyond WWII, and helped Filipino writers embrace their native tongue. The Japanese occupation was fraught with fear and suffering for the Filipinos, and this is reflected in the literature of the time. Wartime Filipino literature is marked as being pessimistic and bitter. Owing to the extreme cruelty and hardship endured during the Japanese occupation, much Japanese influence was repudiated in the Philippines, leading many writers to embrace a more Western sensibility following the end of WWII</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p></p><br />

Japanese period has been called one of the darkest days in the history and literary tradition of the Philippines.

                         Answer;<p></p><p> </p>Japanese literature spans a period of almost two millennia and comprises one of the major literatures in the world, comparable to English literature in age and scope. Explanation;<p></p>It comprises a number of genres, including novels, poetry, and drama, travelogues, personal diaries and collections of random thoughts and impressions. <p></p>From the early seventh century until the present there has never been a period when literature was not being produced by Japanese authors.<p></p> Japan adopted its writing system from China, often using Chinese characters to represent Japanese words with similar phonetic sounds.<p></p> Early works were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China and Chinese literature, and was often written in Classical Chinese. <p></p>Though the Japanese writing system was adapted from Chinese, the two languages are unrelated. <p></p>The rich emotional vocabulary of the Japanese language gave rise to a refined sensitivity of expression, while Chinese was often used to write about more intellectual and abstract concepts such as morality and justice. <p></p>The nature of the spoken Japanese language, in which all words end with a simple vowel and stress accents do not exist, shaped the development of poetic forms which were relatively short in length and defined by the numbers of syllables in each line; and which sought above all for precise expression and rich literary allusion. <p></p>Official court patronage of poetry produced strict artistic codes which dictated the vocabulary and form which could be used for poetic expression.<p></p> Prose emphasized the smooth transition from one statement to another, rather than organization according to a formal theme.<p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>W</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>R</strong><br />
