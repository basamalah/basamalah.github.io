                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>pa follow nalang ako </p><p>thank you</p><p></p><p>Deboning involves using a specialty knife to separate flesh from bones be it meat, poultry or fish. Learning to debone is an advanced culinary skill that takes much practice to perfect, a skill that is vital to develop to take one’s gastronomic prowess to the next level.</p><p></p><p>BONE OR DEBONE - WHY DEBONE MEAT?</p><p>While chefs often choose to keep bones in when cooking different cuts of meat or poultry, there are a number of benefits to deboning them first. This is particularly the case if using a dry cooking method such as roasting.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to popular belief, keeping the bone in does not enhance the overall flavor of the meat when roasting. This is because the flavor-filled part of the bone – the marrow – cannot escape from the bone during this cooking process. However, when the meat is simmered or braised, it does break down and dissolve thanks to the hot liquid, giving the sauce or broth added depth of flavor and richness.</p><p></p><p>What follows is a selection of other deboning benefits.</p><p></p><p>Deboning Meat: Cooking Benefits</p><p>Seasoning - chefs can roll and stuff large cuts of meat. This is a great way to enhance flavor as well as retain larger amounts of moisture, making for very succulent meat.</p><p></p><p>Speed – deboning speeds up the cooking time as bones take longer to heat through than flesh.</p><p></p><p>Safety – taking the bones out evens up the amount of cooking time required for large pieces of meat. For example, removing the backbone from a turkey ensures it cooks evenly, making for a safer meal.</p><p></p><p>Budget – it is generally more expensive to buy fully butchered meat. Many professional chefs find it is more cost-effective to buy larger cuts, and then break down and de-bone themselves.</p><p></p><p>Carving – it is much easier to carve a piece of deboned meat.</p><p></p><p>Upskill – learning to debone meat, fish and poultry is a great way to advance one’s culinary skills repertoire.</p><p></p><br />
