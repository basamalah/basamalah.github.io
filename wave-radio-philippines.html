                                            Directions Read the following paragraphs and idently the main Idea and what type of informational text you are reading Write your answer in the organizer below. The first one is done for you.Paragraph 1 Throwing garbage all over the place will not only diny our surroundings and pollute the environment, making it very unhygienic, but also causes bad coors and encourages the infestation of cockroaches files and other insects. There are various diseases caused due to poor maintenance of hygienic conditions.Paragraph 2 First, wet your hands with plenty of clear water. Second, cover all the surfaces of your hands in soap and rub the palms together to form a lather. Make sure to rub the palm of one hand over the back of the other hand making sure to clean in between your fingers. Repeat with the other hand. Rub the paims together again, and also clean in between the fingers again. Also, tub the backs of the fingers against the opposite palm, interlocking the fingers as you do this. Next, grasp the thumb of one hand with the other hand, and rotate the closed hand around the thumb to clean it. Repeat with the other thumb and hand. Then, rub the tips of the fingers of one hand on the palm of the other hand. Repect with the other hand. Rinse the hands under clean, running water Dey them thoroughly Ideally, with a disposable towe Antematively. ollow them to air dry. Lastly use the towet (f you have one) to fum off ine took and then dispose of itParagraph 3 The importance of good and clean environment connot be descrie adequately. According to many scientists. The factor which influences the growth of individuals most is environment. Every household generates waste or garbage, which should not be thrown anywhere and everywhere, but only in trash bins. I was shocking to see some residents leave their trash bags outside the main door of the garbage chute room, in the passage, in spite of a notice that clearly indicates the procedures to be followed. Even worse, some residents just throw the open bags with contents spilling all over the place. We know for a fact that the habits learnt or followed at a young age get embedded into one's personality. It is very important. therefore, that adults set an example of home for children and are taught clean disposal of home waste.Paragraph 4 Rodrigo Duterte, also called Digong, (bom March 28, 1945, Maasin, Philippines). Filipino palitician who was elected president of the Philippines in 2016. On June 30, 2016. Duterte was inaugurated as president of the Philippines. In his first so months in office, more than 6.000 people were killed in Duterte's "war on drugs."Paragraph 5 Just like visible light, infrared light, and radio waves, ultraviolet light is electromagnetic radiation. On the spectrum. ultraviolet light lies between violet light and x rays, with wavelengths ranging from four to 400 nanometers. Although it is undetectable to the naked eye, anyone who has been exposed​</a>

Air is the mixture ofdifferent gases held by Earths gravity. The gases that compose the atmosphere have important roleto play in the life and functions of all living things. The atmosphere extends from earths surface upto an altitude of about 560 kilometers. As the altitude increases, the atmosphere gets thinner.ObjectivesAt the end of this topic, you should be able to:1. Discuss how energy from the sun enters the atmosphere;2. Explain how some human activities affect the atmosphere;3. Account the occurrence of land and sea breezes, monsoons, and intertropical convergencezone (ITCZ); and4. Describe the effects of certain weather system in the Philippines.I.LoopHow do we use Air?Draw a conclusion about the following1. Fact: People use air to2. Fact: People use air to3.

There are various diseases caused due to poor maintenance of hygienic conditions.Paragraph 2 First, wet your hands with plenty of clear water. Second, cover all the surfaces of your hands in soap and rub the palms together to form a lather. Make sure to rub the palm of one hand over the back of the other hand making sure to clean in between your fingers. Repeat with the other hand. Rub the paims together again, and also clean in between the fingers again. Also, tub the backs of the fingers against the opposite palm, interlocking the fingers as you do this. Next, grasp the thumb of one hand with the other hand, and rotate the closed hand around the thumb to clean it. Repeat with the other thumb and hand. Then, rub the tips of the fingers of one hand on the palm of the other hand. Repect with the other hand. Rinse the hands under clean, running water Dey them thoroughly Ideally, with a disposable towe Antematively. ollow them to air dry. Lastly use the towet (f you have one) to fum off ine took and then dispose of itParagraph 3 The importance of good and clean environment connot be descrie adequately. According to many scientists. The factor which influences the growth of individuals most is environment. Every household generates waste or garbage, which should not be thrown anywhere and everywhere, but only in trash bins. I was shocking to see some residents leave their trash bags outside the main door of the garbage chute room, in the passage, in spite of a notice that clearly indicates the procedures to be followed. Even worse, some residents just throw the open bags with contents spilling all over the place. We know for a fact that the habits learnt or followed at a young age get embedded into one's personality. It is very important. therefore, that adults set an example of home for children and are taught clean disposal of home waste.Paragraph 4 Rodrigo Duterte, also called Digong, (bom March 28, 1945, Maasin, Philippines). Filipino palitician who was elected president of the Philippines in 2016. On June 30, 2016. Duterte was inaugurated as president of the Philippines. In his first so months in office, more than 6.000 people were killed in Duterte's "war on drugs."Paragraph 5 Just like visible light, infrared light, and radio waves, ultraviolet light is electromagnetic radiation. On the spectrum. ultraviolet light lies between violet light and x rays, with wavelengths ranging from four to 400 nanometers. Although it is undetectable to the naked eye, anyone who has been exposed​</h2><br />
