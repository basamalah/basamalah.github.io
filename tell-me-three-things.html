                                            What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</a>

This is my motto whenever things get hard because I believe that God is with me. "Come, let's practice", I called my friend Armand one late afternoon after our English class. He called other participants to proceed to the school gymnasium. Each one took his assigned place and started reciting the first stanza of the poem. Then, the second and so on until we successfully finished reciting the entire piece. "Good job, children! You can win this," Miss Villanueva, our English teacher commented. How did Miss Villanueva motivate the children to give their best? I could still recall one of the most challenging moments in my life three years ago when I got sick of dengue. Nobody could tell that I can survive that time. But because I offered everything to God, I have nothing to worry. That moment made me realize that only in His hands can I be sure that I can be a star and will continue to shine even in the midst of darkness. 1. From whose point of view is the story written? First person, second person, or third person point of view? 2. What is the theme of the story? Is it implicitly or explicitly stated in the story?​</a>

                            6. What's MoreActivity 2: My DefinitionStudy the definition below and answer the questions that followFor me, the word love means trust, friendship, and unselfishness. Firstof all, love means trust because when you trust someone, you can talk tohim/her about anything. For example, I trust my girlfriend 100%. It isbecause I trust her that I know I can tell her anything, and that is why I loveher. Furthermore, I believe that love means friendship because the peoplewho you spend time with are your friends, and if you do not love them, thenwhy would you hang out with them? To illustrate, I love my two best friendsbecause they are like brothers to me. We are always laughing andprotecting each other. Finally, love means unselfishness because whenyou love someone and they love you back, there should always besharing. For instance, my next-door neighbor's wife never shares anythingwith her husband, such as food, drinks, possessions, etc. I sure do not seea whole lot of love there. For me, love means the above three things(Pardede. 2011).1. What is the word being defined?2. How was the definition being expanded?3. Do you agree on how the word is being defined?​</h2><br />

This is my motto whenever things get hard because I believe that God is with me. "Come, let's practice", I called my friend Armand one late afternoon after our English class. He called other participants to proceed to the school gymnasium. Each one took his assigned place and started reciting the first stanza of the poem. Then, the second and so on until we successfully finished reciting the entire piece. "Good job, children! You can win this," Miss Villanueva, our English teacher commented. How did Miss Villanueva motivate the children to give their best? I could still recall one of the most challenging moments in my life three years ago when I got sick of dengue. Nobody could tell that I can survive that time. But because I offered everything to God, I have nothing to worry. That moment made me realize that only in His hands can I be sure that I can be a star and will continue to shine even in the midst of darkness. 1. From whose point of view is the story written?

                        HOW TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN A JOB INTERVIEW?<p></p><p>Hi, this is Margarette, how are you doing? I hope you are all doing great despite this chaos we are in. When I always ask what are my strengths and weaknesses, I always get to overwhelmed about the thoughts I want to pour out but I know that is unnecessary. So, I always ended up telling the things that <strong>people </strong>always say about me. Maybe that is one of my weaknesses, that for me <strong>people</strong>'s opinions matter which I do believe is wrong because <strong>people </strong>have always something to say about you regardless of if you did good or bad. It doesn't matter to them, as long as they can express their mind to you. And I also think, that is also one of my strengths that even if I take people's opinions seriously, I used them as my motivation to be a better person not to please <strong>people </strong>but for myself's growth and mindfulness.
