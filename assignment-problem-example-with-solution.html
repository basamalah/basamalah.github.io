                    <p>Example of Problem i SolutionSeveral students receive poor grades on writingassignments, not because they lack the ability tocommunicate, but because they can not seem tomanage their time when it comes to a large project.They do not know where to begin, and therefore putthings off until the last minute. To solve this problem,students need to develop a timeline for completing theproject. If they divide the assignment into manageable&quot;chunks&quot; or parts and then set a schedule forcompleting each part, they will be able to finish theentire project before the deadline. Without the pressureof not knowing where to begin, the students will be ableto focus on the assignment and communicate theirideas effectively.1. What is the problem?2.

                                            What I Need to KnowIn this week’s lesson, you are to be introduced to the world of research as a discipline. Often, you hear your teachers ask you to do research on a certain assignment. Or you research to get information about a certain person, event, or a company. Sometimes, a problem needs to be studied carefully before a solution can be formulated. This process of carefully gathering information for whatever purpose it might serve is an example of a simple research.  At the end of this week, you are expected to: 1. define research;2. differentiate between inquiry and research;3. characterize research and enumerate the steps followed when conducting one;4. articulate the importance of research in daily life;5. share research experience and knowledge; 6. display a deeper appreciation for the value of research.pahelp po please​</a>

Often, you hear your teachers ask you to do research on a certain assignment. Or you research to get information about a certain person, event, or a company. Sometimes, a problem needs to be studied carefully before a solution can be formulated. This process of carefully gathering information for whatever purpose it might serve is an example of a simple research.  At the end of this week, you are expected to: 1. define research;2. differentiate between inquiry and research;3. characterize research and enumerate the steps followed when conducting one;4. articulate the importance of research in daily life;5. share research experience and knowledge; 6. display a deeper appreciation for the value of research.please help me​</a>

                                            Directions: Read the editorial article and answer the questions that follow. No Smoking Please People should stop smoking. It seems that no matter how many have died because of lung or throat cancer, people still smoke. In the Philippines alone, according to Tobacco Atlas, there are more than 117, 700 of its people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. This is a cause for concern. So, if they can't be stopped from smoking, what should be done to reduce the impact of smoking? One of the few things that can be done is to assign a smoking area in the city. In Davao City for example, people are not allowed to smoke anywhere. There is a designated place where people can smoke for as long as they want. Anyone who is seen smoking in a non-smoking area, receives an equivalent punishment. Another solution is to make the enforcement of the law regarding smoking prohibition in the city much stricter than ever. However, this requires more work as CCTV's need to be installed and more people are needed for monitoring. Increase the prices of cigarettes by increasing the tobacco tax. People keep on smoking because of the relatively cheap price imposed by the government. If only cigarettes are as expensive as wines, then people would only smoke occasionally. It is understandable that the tobacco business will be affected, but the health of the people is more important. It seems that the problem about smoking is far more complex than it appears. And because people can't be stopped from smoking, the impact can be reduced by regulating both the usage and the price.  1.How did the writer introduce the main idea? 2.

To solve this problem,students need to develop a timeline for completing theproject. If they divide the assignment into manageable"chunks" or parts and then set a schedule forcompleting each part, they will be able to finish theentire project before the deadline. Without the pressureof not knowing where to begin, the students will be ableto focus on the assignment and communicate theirideas effectively.1. What is the problem?2.

Often, you hear your teachers ask you to do research on a certain assignment. Or you research to get information about a certain person, event, or a company.

                            17. Directions: Read the editorial article and answer the questions that follow. No Smoking Please People should stop smoking. It seems that no matter how many have died because of lung or throat cancer, people still smoke. In the Philippines alone, according to Tobacco Atlas, there are more than 117, 700 of its people are killed by tobacco-caused disease. This is a cause for concern. So, if they can't be stopped from smoking, what should be done to reduce the impact of smoking? One of the few things that can be done is to assign a smoking area in the city. In Davao City for example, people are not allowed to smoke anywhere. There is a designated place where people can smoke for as long as they want. Anyone who is seen smoking in a non-smoking area, receives an equivalent punishment. Another solution is to make the enforcement of the law regarding smoking prohibition in the city much stricter than ever. However, this requires more work as CCTV's need to be installed and more people are needed for monitoring. Increase the prices of cigarettes by increasing the tobacco tax. People keep on smoking because of the relatively cheap price imposed by the government. If only cigarettes are as expensive as wines, then people would only smoke occasionally. It is understandable that the tobacco business will be affected, but the health of the people is more important. It seems that the problem about smoking is far more complex than it appears. And because people can't be stopped from smoking, the impact can be reduced by regulating both the usage and the price.  1.How did the writer introduce the main idea? 2.
