                                            A. Create a frequency distribution table for the standard deviation of Asian countries and use the method of computing measures of central tendency for ungrouped data to calculate the central tendency measures.B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10. 5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete. ​</a>

The nation is subsisting on a diet of high-calorie convenience food in fact, Americans have increased their spending on fast-food items from $6 billion to nearly $160 billion annually over the past four decades. What may come as a shock. however, is the accumulation of evidence suggesting that the inain ingredients in the typical "hamburger, fries, and a cola are addictive compounds that their fix. lining keep next for customers up (2) The key culprits are sugar and far. Empirical studies reveal that the heavy dosage of these substances in today's super-sized standard of a fast-food meal can trigger brain activity similar to that endured when a person is on hard drugs. A representative individual serving at McDonald's or Burger King can dish out up to 2000 calories, including more than a cup of sugar and 84 grams of fat. Single-handedly. this meal sized portion meets the full daily caloric requirement for the average woman. Moreover, it exceeds the recommended daily allowances of both sugar and fat for any adult, regardless of gender (3) Whercas heroin opiate, both sugar and fat stimulate endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphins in the hypothalamus. just above the brain stem. These naturally oecumng painkillers activate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, into a small cluster of cells located in the midbrain called the nucleus acumens. Here. dopamine functions to elicit feelings of pleasure or euphoria. What's more. it motivates an individual to proactively repeat any action that onginally fucled its production. In the case of sugar and fat, purported addiction is a consequence of the body raving the release of dopamine inherent in consumption (4) To validate reports that fat and sugar bchavc in A drug-like fashion researchers have conducted laboratory studios demonstrating that they induce classic addictive symptoms. For example, eliminating sugar from the nutritiona regime of rats that are used to a primarily sweet diet produced anxiety asymptomatic of heroin and nicotine withdrawal. Moreover, increased tolerance to addictive food substances was noted. In one experiment, rates were fed chocolate drink containing a high ratio of both fat and sugar.

                                            B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10.5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.PLEASE BE MINDFUL DON TUMAWAG ANSWER IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THANKYOU!!​</a>

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

Marker 1 Pencil and Marker 2 Ballpen) Health Check: seven nutrients important for mental health - and where to find them by Jerome Sarris Research literature suggests dietary improvement and nutritional interventions may help reduce the risk, or even arrest the progression, of certain psychiatric disorders. Clinical studies support the use of certain nutrients, which influence a range of neurochemical activities beneficial for treating mental disorders, as medicinal supplements. Evidence from clinical research supports the use of several nutritional medicines for certain psychiatric disorders: omega-3 fatty acids; N-acetyl cysteine (NAC): S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe); zinc; magnesium; vitamin D; and B vitamins (including folic acid). Other natural compounds such as amino acids, plant-based antioxidants and microbiotics (derived from fermented food laboratory synthesis) are also known to influence brain health. But while some evidence supports these natural compounds as having brain chemical-modulating effects, or having a role in treating certain mental disorders, we 3 cannot currently name foods as being effective for the treatment of mental illness. The best nutritional advice at this point is to cultivate an unprocessed wholefood diet, with judicious prescriptive use of nutrients (if required) based on advice from a qualified health professional.pa help po plssssss​</a>

                                            B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature.3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set.4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10.5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency.6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency.7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Significance of the Study: Exploring the Effectiveness of Oregano Extract as a Natural Mosquito Repellent</p><p>Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue, malaria, and Zika, pose a significant health risk to communities worldwide. Insecticides and other chemical-based repellents have been used to prevent mosquito bites, but the harmful effects of these products on human health and the environment have been widely documented. Therefore, there is a need for a natural and safe alternative that can effectively repel mosquitoes.</p><p>The significance of this study lies in its potential to provide a natural and affordable solution to prevent harmful diseases from insects, specifically mosquitoes. Oregano is an herb that is readily available in most communities, and its effectiveness as a mosquito repellent has been suggested by previous studies. By exploring the effectiveness of oregano extract as a natural mosquito repellent, this study can provide valuable insights into the development of safe and effective mosquito control strategies.</p><p>In addition, this study can benefit communities, especially those with limited resources, by providing a cost-effective and accessible solution for mosquito control. Oregano extract is easy to make and does not require expensive equipment or materials, making it a viable option for families, especially those who cannot afford chemical-based repellents. By providing a natural alternative to commercial mosquito repellents, this study can help families save money that can be used for other necessities.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of oregano extract as a mosquito repellent can promote sustainability and environmental consciousness. Unlike chemical-based repellents, which can have adverse effects on the environment, oregano extract is a natural and eco-friendly solution. By promoting the use of natural products for mosquito control, this study can contribute to the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in the community.</p><p>Overall, this study's significance lies in its potential to provide a safe, affordable, and accessible solution to prevent harmful mosquito-borne diseases while promoting sustainability and environmental consciousness in the community.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10. 5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete. ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>attack on titan in history ohh</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Study design depends greatly on the nature of the research question. In other words, knowing what kind of information the study should collect is a first step in determining how the study will be carried out (also known as the methodology).
</p><p>
</p><p>Let’s say we want to investigate the relationship between daily walking and cholesterol levels in the body. One of the first things we’d have to determine is the type of study that will tell us the most about that relationship. Do we want to compare cholesterol levels among different populations of walkers and non-walkers at the same point in time? Or, do we want to measure cholesterol levels in a single population of daily walkers over an extended period of time?
</p><p>
</p><p>The first approach is typical of a cross-sectional study. The second requires a longitudinal study. To make our choice, we need to know more about the benefits and purpose of each study type.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cross-sectional study
</p><p>Both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal studies are observational studies. This means that researchers record information about their subjects without manipulating the study environment. In our study, we would simply measure the cholesterol levels of daily walkers and non-walkers along with any other characteristics that might be of interest to us. We would not influence non-walkers to take up that activity, or advise daily walkers to modify their behaviour. In short, we’d try not to interfere.
</p><p>
</p><p>The defining feature of a cross-sectional study is that it can compare different population groups at a single point in time. Think of it in terms of taking a snapshot. Findings are drawn from whatever fits into the frame.
</p><p>
</p><p>To return to our example, we might choose to measure cholesterol levels in daily walkers across two age groups, over 40 and under 40, and compare these to cholesterol levels among non-walkers in the same age groups. We might even create subgroups for gender. However, we would not consider past or future cholesterol levels, for these would fall outside the frame. We would look only at cholesterol levels at one point in time.
</p><p>
</p><p>The benefit of a cross-sectional study design is that it allows researchers to compare many different variables at the same time. We could, for example, look at age, gender, income and educational level in relation to walking and cholesterol levels, with little or no additional cost.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, cross-sectional studies may not provide definite information about cause-and-effect relationships. This is because such studies offer a snapshot of a single moment in time; they do not consider what happens before or after the snapshot is taken. Therefore, we can’t know for sure if our daily walkers had low cholesterol levels before taking up their exercise regimes, or if the behaviour of daily walking helped to reduce cholesterol levels that previously were high.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

The nation is subsisting on a diet of high-calorie convenience food in fact, Americans have increased their spending on fast-food items from $6 billion to nearly $160 billion annually over the past four decades. What may come as a shock. however, is the accumulation of evidence suggesting that the inain ingredients in the typical "hamburger, fries, and a cola are addictive compounds that their fix. lining keep next for customers up (2) The key culprits are sugar and far. Empirical studies reveal that the heavy dosage of these substances in today's super-sized standard of a fast-food meal can trigger brain activity similar to that endured when a person is on hard drugs. A representative individual serving at McDonald's or Burger King can dish out up to 2000 calories, including more than a cup of sugar and 84 grams of fat. Single-handedly. this meal sized portion meets the full daily caloric requirement for the average woman. Moreover, it exceeds the recommended daily allowances of both sugar and fat for any adult, regardless of gender (3) Whercas heroin opiate, both sugar and fat stimulate endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphins in the hypothalamus. just above the brain stem. These naturally oecumng painkillers activate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, into a small cluster of cells located in the midbrain called the nucleus acumens. Here. dopamine functions to elicit feelings of pleasure or euphoria. What's more. it motivates an individual to proactively repeat any action that onginally fucled its production. In the case of sugar and fat, purported addiction is a consequence of the body raving the release of dopamine inherent in consumption (4) To validate reports that fat and sugar bchavc in A drug-like fashion researchers have conducted laboratory studios demonstrating that they induce classic addictive symptoms. For example, eliminating sugar from the nutritiona regime of rats that are used to a primarily sweet diet produced anxiety asymptomatic of heroin and nicotine withdrawal. Moreover, increased tolerance to addictive food substances was noted. In one experiment, rates were fed chocolate drink containing a high ratio of both fat and sugar. Although the animals were found to ingest increasing amounts of the potent liquid, their tota production of resulting brain opiates was, in fact, diminished. This would sugges that the rodents had become progressively more tolerant to the effects of fnt ang in order achieve sugar. Furthermore, it is likely they would subsequently require a greater quantit the (5) Likewise in Same higt humans, brain-imaging scans of obese and non-obes persons illustrate that the heftier the individual, the fewer dopamine receptors ar present.

                            22. B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10.5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.PLEASE BE MINDFUL DON TUMAWAG ANSWER IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THANKYOU!!​</h2><br />

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

Marker 1 Pencil and Marker 2 Ballpen) Health Check: seven nutrients important for mental health - and where to find them by Jerome Sarris Research literature suggests dietary improvement and nutritional interventions may help reduce the risk, or even arrest the progression, of certain psychiatric disorders. Clinical studies support the use of certain nutrients, which influence a range of neurochemical activities beneficial for treating mental disorders, as medicinal supplements. Evidence from clinical research supports the use of several nutritional medicines for certain psychiatric disorders: omega-3 fatty acids; N-acetyl cysteine (NAC): S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe); zinc; magnesium; vitamin D; and B vitamins (including folic acid). Other natural compounds such as amino acids, plant-based antioxidants and microbiotics (derived from fermented food laboratory synthesis) are also known to influence brain health. But while some evidence supports these natural compounds as having brain chemical-modulating effects, or having a role in treating certain mental disorders, we 3 cannot currently name foods as being effective for the treatment of mental illness. The best nutritional advice at this point is to cultivate an unprocessed wholefood diet, with judicious prescriptive use of nutrients (if required) based on advice from a qualified health professional.pa help po plssssss​</h2><br />

                            28. B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature.3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set.4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10.5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency.6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency.7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Let's say we want to create a frequency distribution table for the ages of a group of people attending a music festival. We collected the data on the ages of 100 people and we want to group the data into intervals of 5. Here's an example of how the frequency distribution table could look like:</p><p></p><p>Age Interval	Frequency</p><p>15-19	12</p><p>20-24	30</p><p>25-29	25</p><p>30-34	18</p><p>35-39	10</p><p>Total	100</p><p>In this example, we chose to group the data into intervals of 5 and the data ranges from 15 to 39. The frequency column indicates the number of people whose ages fall within each interval. For example, 12 people are between the ages of 15-19, 30 people are between the ages of 20-24, and so on. The last row of the table shows the total number of people, which should always be equal to the sum of the frequencies.</p><br />
