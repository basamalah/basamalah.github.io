                            20. 1.Are laws necessary in society? What could be the consequences of not having laws and not implementing laws?
2. Would a unicameral Congress be more effective in the Philippines? How is a unicameral Congress different from a bicameral one? What are the advantages and disadvantages of one over the other in the Philippine context?
3. Is the legislative branch more powerful than the executive and judicial branches given that the former has the power of impeachment? In the Philippines example, has this power been used judiciously? Provide an explanation by referring to practical examples.
4. Which among the other powers of the legislative branch of government would be practical to transfer to the executive branch? Explain your answer.
5. Why is the legislative branch a necessary component of the government? In the case of the Philippines, has the legislature lived up to its mandate? Explain your answer.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Laws are necessary in society as they help to establish rules and guidelines for behavior, protect the rights of individuals, and maintain social order. Without laws, there would be chaos and confusion, as there would be no common standard of behavior or way to enforce rules and resolve conflicts. This could lead to increased crime and violence, and ultimately, a breakdown of society.</p><p></p><p>2. A unicameral Congress, or a legislative body with only one chamber, is different from a bicameral Congress, or a legislative body with two chambers. In the Philippines, the bicameral Congress is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. A unicameral Congress would have only one chamber, which would combine the functions of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p><p></p><p>Advantages of a unicameral Congress in the Philippines could include streamlining the legislative process, reducing the cost of running two chambers, and potentially increasing the efficiency of decision-making. However, some disadvantages could include a lack of representation for different regions or interests, and a potential lack of checks and balances on the power of the legislative branch. Ultimately, whether a unicameral Congress would be more effective in the Philippines would depend on various factors and would require careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>3. The legislative branch of government has the power of impeachment, which allows it to hold members of the executive and judicial branches accountable for wrongdoing. In the Philippines, this power has been used to impeach and remove corrupt officials from office. However, whether or not the legislative branch is more powerful than the other branches of government depends on the specific political system and the distribution of power within it. In some systems, the executive branch may have more power, while in others, the judicial branch may have more power.</p><p></p><p>4. It would not be practical to transfer any of the powers of the legislative branch to the executive branch, as this would undermine the principle of separation of powers and the checks and balances that are essential for maintaining a fair and just society. The powers of each branch of government are designed to serve specific purposes and to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.</p><p></p><p>5. The legislative branch of government is a necessary component of the government because it plays a key role in making laws, which are essential for maintaining social order and protecting the rights of individuals. In the case of the Philippines, the legislature has not always lived up to its mandate, as there have been instances of corruption and abuse of power. However, the country has also made progress in recent years in addressing these issues and improving the effectiveness and transparency of its legislative branch.</p><br />
