Lyrics
Ok, ok, I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui
Breathe it in
I know it's a lot
The hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demi-god
What can I say except, "You're welcome"
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
Hey
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yea high?
This guy
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh, also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees
So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay
You're welcome
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome
You're welcome

I came right away when you called me up by phone to come and see you. MATIL: That’s nice of you Mrs. De los Reyes. FLOR: I hope you don’t mind but my last name is Caracoles. My full name really is Florencia Aragon de Caracoles. But just call me Florencia. It’s quite an honor to know you, Matilde. I’ve heard you are one of the best known society women in Manila. MATIL: Oh don’t mention it. It isn’t true, not true at all. FLOR: You’re so modest Matilde. MATIL: I was told by Marilu to get in touch with you. She said you’d surely help. FLOR: Did you say Marilu called you up? Marilu de Legazpi? Whose husband is the owner of that big department store at Buendia? MATIL: Yes. But the reason that I called you up was…FLOR: Oh well my husband bought the Legazpi’s rice fields in Pangasinan that cost us P100,000.00 but it was worth it. MATIL: That’s nice. FLOR: Well now, just how did you want me to collaborate—er—help? MATIL: It’s a benefit show we are holding to collect funds for the Sapang Palay people. You know the place? FLOR: (With a gesture of disgust). Uff, yes. Those squatters who were formerly in Intramuros. Thank God they are evicted. Can you imagine? I used to hear mass everyday at the Cathedral and whenever we passed in our Mercedes benz 600 by those streets, I felt my self-suffocating with the smells and sights of those horrible people. Uff, such disgusting squatters’ people. I couldn’t hear the mass properly and I couldn’t pray because of them. MATIL: It’s not their fault, really. After the war thousands came from the province and didn’t know where to settle.• Briefly answer the following questions:1. What do you notice in the script? 2.

Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. 22 Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, 23 and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. 24 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.” 25 Then he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! 26 Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?” 27 Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures. 28 As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. 29 But they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.” So he went in to stay with them. 30 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. 31 Then their eyes were opened, and they recognised him; and he vanished from their sight. 32 They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?” 33 That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. 34 They were saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!” 35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread. ​​</a>

Oh, also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees
So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay
You're welcome
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome
You're welcome

                            3. STAGING: (When the curtain rises, we see Florencia and Matilde, seated on the sofa, in Matilde’s sala, talking.) FLOR: Yes Matilde! I came right away when you called me up by phone to come and see you. MATIL: That’s nice of you Mrs. De los Reyes. FLOR: I hope you don’t mind but my last name is Caracoles. My full name really is Florencia Aragon de Caracoles. But just call me Florencia. It’s quite an honor to know you, Matilde. I’ve heard you are one of the best known society women in Manila. MATIL: Oh don’t mention it. It isn’t true, not true at all. FLOR: You’re so modest Matilde. MATIL: I was told by Marilu to get in touch with you. She said you’d surely help. FLOR: Did you say Marilu called you up? Marilu de Legazpi? Whose husband is the owner of that big department store at Buendia? MATIL: Yes. But the reason that I called you up was…FLOR: Oh well my husband bought the Legazpi’s rice fields in Pangasinan that cost us P100,000.00 but it was worth it. MATIL: That’s nice. FLOR: Well now, just how did you want me to collaborate—er—help? MATIL: It’s a benefit show we are holding to collect funds for the Sapang Palay people. You know the place? FLOR: (With a gesture of disgust). Uff, yes. Those squatters who were formerly in Intramuros. Thank God they are evicted. Can you imagine? I used to hear mass everyday at the Cathedral and whenever we passed in our Mercedes benz 600 by those streets, I felt my self-suffocating with the smells and sights of those horrible people. Uff, such disgusting squatters’ people. I couldn’t hear the mass properly and I couldn’t pray because of them. MATIL: It’s not their fault, really. After the war thousands came from the province and didn’t know where to settle.• Briefly answer the following questions:1. What do you notice in the script? 2.

                            4. Read the gospel reading answer Which line struck you the most and why ?Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 14 and talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 15 While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them, 16 but their eyes were kept from recognising him. 17 And he said to them, “What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?” They stood still, looking sad. 18 Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?” 19 He asked them, “What things?” They replied, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 20 and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him. 21 But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place. 22 Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, 23 and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. 24 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.” 25 Then he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared! 26 Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?” 27 Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures. 28 As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on. 29 But they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over.” So he went in to stay with them. 30 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. 31 Then their eyes were opened, and they recognised him; and he vanished from their sight. 32 They said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?” 33 That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together. 34 They were saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!” 35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread. ​​</h2><br />
