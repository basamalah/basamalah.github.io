                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>She is a diligent, hardworking and VERY kind (which is actually irritating) girl. Although it teaches people to be kind, in this modern world where there are a lot of abusers who like to take advantage of kind people, it is not really ideal. Yes it's important to be kind but it's important to have your limits and walk away from people and things that do not deserve you. However, my critic on Cinderella is not the story itself but of which the people have perpetuated an idea about how it is all about finding a Prince Charming. She just wanted to have a good time outside from that hellhole. She just happened to meet a Prince who fell in love with her and she basically ends up as a Princess. That's good karma right there. </p><p></p><br />

The way events are ordered to create a story is called the PLOT. The PLOT is all of the action that takes place during the story.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cinderella and Her Odious Household Chores</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but do people actually</p><p></p><p>think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was</p><p></p><p>not glamorous. She did everything from sweeping the floors to cooking the meals. If</p><p></p><p>someone had asked Cinderella which chores she did not particularly like, she probably</p><p></p><p>would have answered, “Why, none, of course. Housework is my duty!” In today’s</p><p></p><p>increasingly busy society, however, most people admit that they have definite dislikes</p><p></p><p>for certain household chores. The top three of these unpopular tasks often include</p><p></p><p>ironing clothes, washing dishes, and cleaning the bathroom.</p><p></p><p>One of the most hated chores for many people is ironing clothes because it is not</p><p></p><p>a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be</p><p></p><p>handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece</p><p></p><p>of clothing meticulously, which entails smoothing out the fabric, following the seams,</p><p></p><p>and getting the creases just right, it needs to be put on a hanger as soon as possible. If</p><p></p><p>not, this item might become wrinkled and need to be ironed again. Perhaps the reason</p><p></p><p>that ironing is not a favorite chore is that it requires extreme attention to detail from</p><p></p><p>beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Another household chore that many people dislike is washing dishes. Of course,</p><p></p><p>some people claim that this chore is no longer a problem because dishwashers are</p><p></p><p>available now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots</p><p></p><p>and pans washed in a dishwasher come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, many people continue to wash their dishes by hand, but they are not</p><p></p><p>necessarily happy doing it. Washing dishes is a dirty job that requires not only elbow</p><p></p><p>grease to scrape food off the dishes but also the patience to rinse and dry them. In</p><p></p><p>addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a chore that usually must be done</p><p></p><p>every day. Regardless of how Cinderella felt about this particular chore, it is obvious that</p><p></p><p>most people do not enjoy doing it.</p><p></p><p>Though ironing clothes and washing dishes are not the most pleasant household</p><p></p><p>chores, perhaps the most dreaded chore is cleaning the bathroom. This task involves</p><p></p><p>tackling three main areas: the bathtub, sink, and toilet. Because the bathroom is full of</p><p></p><p>germs, a quick wiping of the surface is not enough. As a result, strong bathroom</p><p></p><p>cleansers are necessary to clean and disinfect this room. The task of cleaning the</p><p></p><p>bathroom is so unpleasant that some people wear rubber gloves when they attempt it.</p><p></p><p>The only positive point about cleaning the bathroom is that it does not have to be done</p><p></p><p>on a daily basis.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining a house means doing a wide variety of unpleasant chores. Cinderella</p><p></p><p>knew this, and so does the rest of the world. Many individuals do not have the luxury of</p><p></p><p>hiring an outside person to do their own housework, so they must make do with their</p><p></p><p>own resources. Still, taking pride in the results of this hard work helps many people get</p><p></p><p>through the unpleasantness of these chores.</p><p></p><p>Note: This essay was adapted from the textbook Great Essays by Keith S.
