                                            What I Have Learned 1. The history of the social sciences begins in the roots of ancient philosophy. 2. Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolution, such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution. 3. In the period of 1760 some effort was exerted on the study of man and society. Hobbes Leviathan; Lock's Two Treatises on Government; Vico's New Science; and Montesquieu Spirit of Laws were all published in this period. 4. By the middle of 18th century, capitalism had begun to outgrow its early state and gradually it became the dominant socio-economic system in western and northern Europe. 5. Auguste comte (1798-1853) invented the term sociology. He was the first to systematize and give a complete analysis of the principles of the positive character of social sciences. 6. Montesquieu and Voltaire broke a new path for politics and history. 7. At the beginning of the 19th century, social science had attained in all the leading European countries a firm and respectable position. 8. 20th Century Development. At this stage the social science has become institutionalized to a high degree. It has now become a subject of research. 9. Social Sciences as those mental or cultural sciences which deal with the activities of the individual as member of the group. 10. Natural Sciences is a major branch of science that deals with the description, prediction and understanding of natural phenomena, basically based on observational and empirical evidence. 11. Humanities refer to the study of the ways in which the human experience is processed and documented. 12. The two main branches of Natural Science are life sciences/biological sciences and physical sciences.​</a>
