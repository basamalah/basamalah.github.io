                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Characters in the novel "Noli Me Tangere" and their roles:</p><p></p><p>-Crisostomo Ibarra: The protagonist of the story. He returns to the Philippines after studying in Europe and seeks to enact reforms in his hometown, San Diego.</p><p>-Maria Clara: The love interest of Crisostomo Ibarra. She is the daughter of Captain Tiago and is described as a beautiful and devout Catholic.</p><p>-Padre Damaso: A Spanish friar and one of the main antagonists of the story. He represents the oppressive Spanish colonial rule and abuses his power for personal gain.</p><p>-Padre Salvi: Another Spanish friar who is a rival of Padre Damaso. He is also depicted as corrupt and manipulative.</p><p>-Captain Tiago: The father of Maria Clara and a wealthy Filipino who is portrayed as subservient to the Spanish friars.</p><p>-Sisa: A mentally unstable woman and mother of Crispin and Basilio. She represents the suffering of the Filipino people under colonial oppression.</p><p>-Basilio: A young boy who becomes a student of Padre Salvi. He is portrayed as innocent and later plays a crucial role in the sequel novel "El Filibusterismo."</p><p>-Crispin: The younger brother of Basilio. He is mistreated and abused by those in power, including the friars.</p><p></p><p>2. At the laying of the cornerstone for the new school led by Ibarra, a poisonous snake is placed in the cornerstone, causing chaos and panic among the attendees. The incident is orchestrated by Padre Damaso, who wants to discredit and sabotage Ibarra's efforts to build the school, as he sees it as a threat to his own power and influence.</p><p></p><p>3. Ibarra loses his self-control over Padre Damaso because Padre Damaso insulted his deceased father during a dinner gathering. Ibarra's father, Don Rafael, was wrongly accused and died in jail due to Padre Damaso's influence. The insult to his father's memory triggers Ibarra's anger and leads to him confronting Padre Damaso in a fit of rage.</p><p></p><p>4. Ibarra initiates various efforts for the betterment of his town, San Diego. This includes his plan to build a school to promote education, his desire to establish a public water system for the town, and his intention to improve the lives of the Filipino people by advocating for reforms against the abuses of the Spanish friars and colonial government.</p><p></p><p>5"Excommunicated" refers to the act of being officially expelled or banned from the Catholic Church. Ibarra becomes excommunicated because he was accused of being a filibuster or a subversive against the Church and the Spanish colonial government. This accusation was orchestrated by the friars who saw Ibarra as a threat to their authority and interests due to his reformist efforts.</p><p></p><p>6.Padre Salvi arrests Ibarra and puts him in jail based on false accusations of being involved in subversive activities against the government. Padre Salvi's reason for doing so is to protect the interests of the friars and maintain their control over the Filipino people, as Ibarra's actions were seen as a challenge to their authority.</p><p></p><p>7. Maria Clara did not betray Ibarra. In fact, Maria Clara remained loyal to Ibarra throughout the story despite the challenges and conflicts they faced. She was forced into a marriage with Linares, a Spanish military officer, by her father Captain Tiago and Padre Damaso, but she secretly remained devoted to Ibarra.</p><p> </p><p>8.The secret revealed in the letters found by Padre Salvi in the convento was that Padre Damaso was Maria Clara's real father, not Captain Tiago as she had</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
