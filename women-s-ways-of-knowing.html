 GENERALIZATION:
Be challenged by public speaking. It is a sight to behold when you as the speaker hold and attract the attention of your audience. Be always reminded of the ff. techniques/devices: Go straight to the Point; Imagery; Poetry; Suspense; Surprise; Conflict X Solution; Humor; Questions and Drama.
 “A borrowed book is like a guest in the house; it must be treated with punctiliousness, with a
 certain considerate formality. You must see that it sustains no damage; it must not suffer while under your roof. You cannot leave it carelessly, you cannot mark it, you cannot turn down the
 pages, you cannot use it familiarly. And then, someday, although this is seldom done, you really
 ought to return it.” _______________________________________________________
 You have left it to women in your land, the men of all civilized countries have left it to women,
 to work out their own salvation. That is the way in which we women of England are doing. Human life for us is sacred, but we say if any life is to be sacrificed it shall be ours; we won’t do it ourselves, but we will put the enemy in the position where they will have to choose between giving us
 freedom or giving us death.” ___________________________________
 3.” I am come amongst you, as you see, at this time, not for my recreation and disport, but being resolved, in the midst and heat of the battle, to live and die amongst you all; to lay down for my God, and for my kingdom, and my people, my honor and my blood, even in the dust. I know I
 have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should
 dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which rather than any dishonor shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms, I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your
 virtues in the field.”_______________________________________________

                                            LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</a>

                            3. LEVEL 3: ADVANCE 	Advance your skills! 	As a critical thinker, one should know how to analyze statements and draw conclusions from them. In this way, misunderstanding can be avoided. 	Your next task is to make or draw out a claim of value from each given argument. Example:	The world has sped up over the past generation; technology has gotten more complicated and ideas more complex. Hence, higher math like Algebra should be introduced as early as grades 7 and 8. However, children in grades 7 and 8 are experiencing plateau growth. They are not in their optimal years of learning, thus the growing number of failing students. Claim of Value: It is better to introduce higher math like Algebra in grade 10 instead. 	Dealing with unruly siblings can be maddening. Sometimes, we tend to easily lose our control and we wouldn’t notice we’re already raising our voices up to our ceiling. However, yelling towards our siblings is a costly mistake. Yelling only works in the moment. It can also cause our siblings to secretly dislike us. Another is, when we yell, we only train them to listen to us only when we raise our voice. No matter how frustrated you may get with your siblings, yelling should never be or should be the least of your option/s. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	‘Dark’ is a mind-bending and meticulously crafted TV series. It is arguably the best time travel show that I have witnessed. It doesn’t limit itself to that theme alone. It also tackles quantum entanglement, parallel, and alternative universe. Predictability does not count in the series. There will always be revelations. The plot is indeed perplexing but decently maintained all throughout. Overall, I must say, it’s a great show to binge watch. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	The library is a place for readers to explore, create, relax, and simply be. It is a window to investigate and see the world. The experience transforms readers from the narrow existence of daily life to the wide world beyond our brick and mortar walls. Public libraries play a very important role in fostering the intellectual development of society. It is one of the critical links to different institutions in our society, such as schools. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ 	Divorce should never be legalized in our country. It is not the answer to marital problems. It threatens the sanctity of marriage. The proposition will actually increase the number of failed marriages. It can also introduce the child to destructive behavior. The existence of divorce will also mean loss of faith in marriage and family unit. Divorce takes a toll on a family’s income which may lead to poverty aggravation. Claim of Value: _______________________________________________________________________________________ Filipinos have been a fan of beauty pageants. Beauty pageants have been entertaining us for the past decades. 		However, I believe beauty pageants degrade women. Women in such competitions are treated as physical objects for pleasure and not as human beings. They are judged based on their physical attributes mostly. They spend more time parading in swimsuits and gowns and very little time on intelligence. Claim of Value: ​</h2><br />
