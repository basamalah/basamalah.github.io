__________ 1. In SMART goal setting, S stands for specific which means you should
write exactly what you want to achieve.
_________ 2. The Principle of Frequency states that you must perform physical
exercise more than normal amounts to get an improvement.
_________ 3. The Principle of Progression says that you need to gradually increase
both the intensity and duration of your physical training routine.
_________ 4. Exercise program is a planned activity detailing a range of physical
exercises and the amount of time each exercise should be spent for rest.
_________ 5. If you want to calculate your Target Heart Rate, you need to subtract
your age from 220.
_________ 6. In the Principle of Variation, different exercises are included in the
routine that are also applicable for the desired outcome of the training.
_________ 7. A SMART goal is something that you want to do further in the future
and requires time and planning.
_________ 8. If you want to get your body ready for more strenuous activities and
make it easier to exercise, you should do warm up exercises first.
_________ 9. A SMART goal means that your goal is special, measurable,
achievable, reliable, and time bound.
_________ 10. Static exercises are more appropriate in the cool down as they help
muscles to relax, realign muscle fibers to make it easier to exercise.
__________ 11. The Principle of Recovery states that the rest periods between physical
training are just as important as the training itself.
__________ 12. The Resting Heart Rate is the number of heart beats per minute while
you’re at rest.
_________ 13. The fitness principle that states a specific muscle group is improved
by matching the actions of the game/event is called Principle of Variation.
__________ 14. Short term goals are achievable in a shorter amount of time.
_________ 15. In an exercise program, frequency is the number of times one should

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It’s nothing new but often overlooked. Setting a goal will drastically improve your chance of reaching a desired outcome. It sounds really obvious. However, it might surprise you to hear that many people go to the gym or partake in fitness activities with no real goal in mind, without any real objective.</p><p></p><p>If you think about any task you do, whether simple or complex, there is usually a goal at the end of it. For example, most weeks you perform a simple task in writing a shopping list with the intention of buying those items because you need them. You know whether you’ve been successful once you’ve checked them off against the list. Without that list there is an increased likelihood you might forget something which equates to not achieving your goal.</p><p></p><p>The same principle can be applied to fitness. Having a goal and writing it down somewhere you can check it helps you to plan what you need to do to achieve it. So you don’t end up in the gym wandering around wondering what exercise to include in your session.</p><p></p><p>Not having a goal also makes it hard to know what you’ve achieved or what you’re trying to achieve. You might think you’re doing all the right things, but in reality you’re focussing too much time on one aspect of your fitness and not enough on another. Fitness goals are important as they help us to stay aligned and do the workouts we might skip if left to our own devices.</p><p></p><p>The mind is an incredible tool but subconsciously it can deceive us. For example, if you don’t like leg days, it’s easy to forget the last time you did a leg strength session. Without a goal you might think “I did a leg session last week, that’s okay,” but in actual fact it was 2 weeks ago, and now you’ve neglected it again and your overall strength is lacking.</p><p></p><p>However, if you regularly check your fitness goals, you’ll quickly realise that you’re not on target with leg strength like you are in other areas. Without your written fitness goals, you won’t notice it until your friend’s start making sarcastic comments about your chicken legs.</p><p></p><p>Fitness goals are perhaps the best form of maintaining motivation for exercise.  Short term goals give you a sense an immediate target to focus on while long term goals keep your overall objective in mind, striving for higher achievements. When you reach your goals, tick them off against your list and make new ones.  In my experience, being able to do that provides a great sense of satisfaction and extra motivation to start on the next goal.</p><p></p><p>In summary, here is why fitness goals are important.</p><p></p><p>They keep you on the right track</p><p>They make working out efficient</p><p>They help you progress more quickly</p><p>They help you see your progress</p><p>They keep you motivated</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>PABRAINLIEST</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PO</strong><strong> </strong><strong>THANKYOU</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>STAYSAFE</strong></p><p></p><br />

It provides guides on how to control your program and get favorable results. 3. In this FITT Principle, if you are doing a split routine, like upper body at some point and lower body subsequent, your workouts are going to be more frequent than total body workouts. 4. In this FITT Principle, if you want to create strength, use heavyweights to try to do more sets with fewer repetitions for example, five sets of three repetitions each. 5. In this FITT Principle, if your goal is to develop muscle, do a higher number of sets with a moderate amount of repetitions (four sets of 10 to 12 reps each). 6. This principle differs depending on the health-related fitness component fargeted. 7. This exercises is the most vital for competitive endurance athletes, like marathoners, because it helps regulate blood flow. 8. This exercises increases the blood flow-to the working-muscles without an abrupt increase in lactic acid accumulation. 9. This principle refers to the definite physical activity selected to improve a component of health-related fitness. 10. In this principle, dancing, running, walking, jogging, and cycling are some of the wide variety of activities you may choose in this principles.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Established realistic ones </strong>is the most important rule in setting goal in making a fitness plan. When you set goals, it should follow the acronym SMART; it should be simple, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time bound.
The purpose of cooling down exercise is <strong>to allow the body to gradual transition in a near-resting state. </strong>Examples of cooling down exercises are light jogging or walking, upper body stretches, knee-to-chest pose, seated forward bend, reclining butterfly pose, and child’s pose.
<strong>Vigorous intensity </strong>is a type of exercise is it when you are not be able to say more than a few words without pausing for a breath. Examples of vigorous exercise include sprint running, playing basketball, doing a marathon running or swimming, cycling uphill, mountain biking, mountain climbing, rock climbing, and bouldering.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The Overload Principle is considered the most important concept in exercise. In simple terms, it means that your body will adapt to the demand you impose on it</p><p></p><p>2. The Principle of Specificity</p><p></p><p>The Principle of SpecificityThis principle simply states that exercising a certain body part or component of the body primarily develops that part. The principle of specificity implies that to become better at a particular exercise or skill, you must perform that exercise or skill.</p><p></p><p>3. The overload principle is one of the seven big laws of fitness and training. Simply put, it says that you have to increase the intensity, duration, type, or time of a workout progressively in order to see adaptations. The adaptations are improvements in endurance, strength, or muscle size.</p><p></p><p>4.
