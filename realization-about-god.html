                                            DAILY ENCOUNTERS WITH GOD” Your class was tasked by the CBCP’s Episcopal Commission on Youth (ECY) to write a booklet containing short reflections about your daily encounters with God (scenario). This booklet will be published in order to inspire and encourage the Filipino Catholic Youth (audience) to recognize signs of God’s presence in the events of day-to-day life. You will work individually as writers or authors (role) since the task involves writing about your personal experiences or encounters with God. You will write and reflect about your daily encounters with God in your journal notebook (journal file), demonstrating the various signs (natural, biblical, liturgical, or ecclesial) of God’s Revelation around us (goal). Your CLEd teacher will read your journal entries and the best reflections may be submitted to the Campus Ministry office and used as reflection pieces for the school’s spiritual activities. Your work will be graded according to the following standards: 1. Content 2. Relevance 3. Creativity 4. Format Each story/encounter/experience should: Ø be within 15-20 sentences only; Ø have an appropriate title and symbol/image to represent the piece; Ø contain a concrete description of the event or experience which led you to encounter the Lord; Ø describe how you felt given the encounter; Ø identify at least 2 important realizations or insights that you had; Ø Be inspiring to your audience/readers, encouraging them to see God’s presence even in the simple experiences of daily life.

You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” Acts 10: 34a, 37-43

                        concept of God and heaven is a complex and varied topic that has been explored by many different philosophers and religions throughout history. Some believe in a single, all-powerful creator deity, while others believe in multiple gods or a pantheon of deities. The idea of heaven is also interpreted differently by various belief systems, with some seeing it as a place of eternal reward and others as a state of spiritual enlightenment. Ultimately, the existence of God and heaven is a matter of personal belief and faith.<br /><br /><br />Hope this help:)<br />#UOLGAMARIE<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My realizations of a broken relationship with God and our neighbors is because of what we feel and what we make others feel. When we get betrayed, what we are expecting did not happen, anger and sadness are some reasons but despite of things happen that can break our relationship with them, we could make it a better and stronger relationship with them. a Simple understanding, acceptance and forgiveness. It's important to understand one another and our different opinions and to just support everyone's different perspectives, acceptance is very important especially when we expect something but it did not happen always accept the outcome because you should always be ready to be hurt if you know your hoping in something that is not really sure so accept and trust God's perfect timing, lastly forgiveness learn to forgive our neighbors because no one is perfect people make mistakes and even if they didn't ask for an apology always forgive for your own peace of mind. There are a lot of things we can do to have a much better and stronger relationship with God and our neighbors and one of the most important is Love, We live to love.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Long </strong><strong>essay </strong><strong>hehe:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><br />

                            22. Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism. You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” Acts 10: 34a, 37-43
