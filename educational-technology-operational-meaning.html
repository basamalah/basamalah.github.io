Highlight the facts and box the opinions.Cell Phones Don't Contribute to Learningby Mary Ann JohnsonPeople are using cell phones everywhere, even in schools, leading some schoolsystems to ban them during the academic day. "Cell phones don't contribute to learning andare potentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education."There are already enough distractions; there's no need to add another."Sherman, who researches how children leam, explains that cell phones may inhibityounger children from leaming the full range of communication."Cell phones mediate or 'stand between people," he says. The words are sent butthe non-verbal information is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, andphysical gestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. Whencommunication is frequently mediated, it is possible children will not leam these subtleaspects of communicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones,computer e-mail, and video. It is appropriate to limit this mediated communication withyoung children.Modern cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" worries manyeducators. Children can spend two to four hours each day in front of screens. Much of thistime has limited physical and mental activity. Often solitary entertainment screen time canoccupy the majority of children's out of school free time. Educators recommend that childrenengage in active play, read, play social board games, and fantasy play. "Screen time shouldbe limitedSherman listed a few other reasons for not having cell phones in school includingthat the ringing can be a distraction. Cell phones could contribute to social inequitiescreating a new level of "have/have-not" distinction. There may also be a "keep up withJones" response as new and fancier phone technology comes along. Cell phones are smalland getting smaller, thus, are easily lost and a potential target for theft"There are no good reasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of thereasons frequently given for youngsters to have cell phones is to allow them to be able tocontact someone in an emergency. "But schools are safe places so emergencies don'thappen often," Sherman says. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies andmaking the appropriate contacts. Besides, it is not good to give children the impressionschools are unsafe exactly the opposite of the truth."There really are no clear learning related uses," Sherman says, "and severaldisadvantages."It also is not accurate for families to think that the cell phone is making it easier fordaily planning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make plans-thusnecessitating a call to the child—is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaming to plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed and within a well-planned context."Young students don't need this electronic tether to home and parents. They shouldlearn to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children can't make, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leam to be independent thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected," Sherman says.​</a>

Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, and physicalgestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words.

Today much communication is mediated with telephones, computer e-mail, and video. It is oppropriate to limit this mediated comnunication with young children.Modem cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" woies many educators.Children can spendtwo to four hours eoch day in front of screens. Much of this fime has limitedphysical and mental octivity.

"OCell phones don't confribute to leaming ond arepotentially a distraction," says Thomas Sherman, Virginia Tech professor of education. "Thereare aready ernough distractions; there's no needto add another.""Cell phones medicte or stond between' people," he says. The words are seni but threnon-verbol informotion is not. Some consider the voice tone, facial expression, and physicalgestures as important to the meaning of a message as the words. When communication isfrequently medioted, it is possible children will not lean these subtle aspects ofcommunicating well. Today much communication is mediated with telephones, computer e-mail, and video. It is oppropriate to limit this mediated comnunication with young children.Modem cell phones are sophisticated devices that, like games, television sets, andcomputers, operate from screens. The idea of excessive "screen time" woies many educators.Children can spendtwo to four hours eoch day in front of screens. Much of this fime has limitedphysical and mental octivity. Often solitary entertainment screen time can occupy themajority of children's out of school free fime. Educators recommend that children engage inactive ploy, read, play social boord games, and fantasy play. "Screen time" should be limited.Sherman listed a few olher reasons tor not having cell phones in school inncluding thatthe ringing can be a distiaction. Ceilphones could contribste to social inequities creating anew level ot "have/hove-no" distinclion. There may aiso be o "keep up with Jones" responseas new and lancier phone technology comes clong. Cell phones cre srmall and geltingsmaller, thus, are easily lost and a potentiol target for thefl."There are no goodreasons for children to have cell phones," he says. One of the reasonsfrequently given for youngsters to hove cell phones is to allow them to be able to contactsomeone in arı emergency. "8ut schools are safe places so emergencies don't happen offten."Shermon soys. "Schools are good about recognizing emergencies and making the appropriate contacts. Besides. il is not good to give children the impression schools are unsote- exactly the opposite of the truth."There realy areno clear leaming-related uses," Shermon says, "and severaldisadvantoges."li also is not occurate for fomilies to think that the cell phone is makingit easier for datyplanning. Sherman suggested that waiting until the last minute to make pions thusnecessitating a call to the child - is a poor model for children. It is a better model for childrento be leaning lo plan and study with a longer perspective. Parents should keep childreninformed ond within a well-planned confext."Young students don't need this elechionic tether to home and parents. They shouldlean to make decisions and experience the consequences. If children con't moke, on theirown, the decisions needed at school, they may never leorn to be indepencient thinkers. Wejust don't need to be so 'connected,"Sherman says.Fact1234Bias5678Plss help po ty​</h2><br />
