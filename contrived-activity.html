Write your answers on the space provided before the number.____________________1.Teaching starts with the small details and then expands to the bigger picture.____________________2. This process suggests that our perceptual experience is based entirely on the sensory stimuli that we piece together using only data that is available from our senses.____________________3. We form our perceptions starting with a larger object, concept, or idea before working our way toward more detailed information.____________________4. It starts with an incoming stimulus and working upwards until a representation of the object is formed in our minds.____________________5. This process happens when we work from the general to the specific.____________________6. It can be defined as sensory analysis that begins at the entry-level—with what our senses can detect.____________________7. Abstract impressions can influence the information that you gather through your five senses.____________________8. This focuses on incoming sensory data and data driven.____________________9. It allows us to make sense of information that has already been brought in by the senses.____________________10. The processing takes place as it happens.____________________11. Readers can use many sources of information, such as phonological, orthographic, semantic and syntactic information, to understand the meaning of the text.____________________12. The third theory of the reading processes. ____________________13. This reading theory contrives that the reader makes use of different reading strategies in understanding the selection text.____________________14. If a student has a weak area in reading then the student can rely on other sources of reading knowledge.____________________15. Good readers use multiple processes that result in fluent and accurate reading.​</a>

As everyone all know, social order is defined consistently as definite state of stability and sure consensus that will always exist in the absence of chaos and nerve-wracking upheaval. 2. Long time ago, sometime after the Spanish colonization, the period of 1910-1950 have been quoted as the period of apprenticeship or simply put imitation. During this era several many native writers imitated and mimicked American people and American writers. 3. The mimicking period or apprenticeship period greatly released and produced highly emotional topics rather than something else. It can also be said that there were writers who really tried contrived melodramas (mello + dramas) or soft drama. We should not forget also the Filipino native writers who tried comedy.NEED A QUICK ANSWER PLSSSS!!​</a>

                                            Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</a>

Select one:
a. minimal governing: If rulers follow the Dao then their states will be well ordered and in natural harmony
b. effortless action: everything we do should flow with simple spontaneity and without contrivance
c. return: all things eventually decay and return to their ultimate source within the Dao ✔ 
d. primitive simplicity : the ideal, which in practical terms means small farming families and communities
return: all things eventually decay and return to their ultimate source within the Dao ✔ 
The basic idea of the Daoists was to enable people to realize that, since human life is really only a small part of a larger process of nature, the only human actions which ultimately make sense are those which are in accord with the flow of Nature — the Dao or the Way.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To avoid contrived flattery:</p><p>. Put up your Hedges</p><p>Establish boundaries for how people can engage you. </p><p></p><p>2. Accept Compliments and Move On</p><p>When people compliment you, thank them politely but don't dwell on the compliment too long. </p><p></p><p>3. Leverage Relationships to Achieve Outcomes</p><p>Building relationships is important but there's more to it. Build relationships with people that will help you reach organizational goals. </p><p></p><p>4. Stay Focused on Results </p><p>A lot of times, leaders get lost in the minutia of relationship building. It's important not to lose sight of relationships, but it's even more important not to lose sight of monitoring results. </p><p></p><p>5. Commit to Consistency</p><p>Be consistent in how you treat every employee. Everyone is watching you and they are looking for preferential treatment. Consistency is critical. </p><p></p><p>6. Monitor All</p><p>If the organization is to improve, then every employee must be monitored. </p><p></p><p>7. Confront Equitably</p><p>Effective leaders confront behaviors not people, and they confront everyone in the same manner. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>9. Value Honesty</p><p>Engage people who are honest in all situations, not just those who know when to play the Honest Abe card. </p><p></p><p>10. Engage in Intellectual Stimulation</p><p>Great leaders facilitate professional conflict and discourse. Flattery doesn't have a chance when the goal is getting better. </p><p></p><p>11. Argue Frequently</p><p>By debating with people often about the course of the organization, leaders can quickly determine if a person is a flatterer or not. </p><p></p><p>12. Value the Organization over People</p><p>People come and go but the organization should last forever. Effective leaders protect the future of the organization. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying behavior is a serious problem among school-age children and adolescents; it has short- and long-term effects on the individual who is bullied, the individual who bullies, the individual who is bullied and bullies others, and the bystander present during the bullying event. In this chapter, the committee presents the consequences of bullying behavior for children and youth. As referenced in Chapter 1, bullying can be either direct or indirect, and children and youth may experience different types of bullying. Specifically the committee examines physical (including neurobiological), mental, and behavioral health consequences. The committee also examines consequences for academic performance and achievement and explores evidence for some of the mechanisms proposed for the psychological effects of bullying. When applicable, we note the limited, correlational nature of much of the available research on the consequences of bullying.</p><p>  </p><p>Sayōnara</p><br />

                            27. Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</h2><br />

The basic idea of the Daoists was to enable people to realize that, since human life is really only a small part of a larger process of nature, the only human actions which ultimately make sense are those which are in accord with the flow of Nature — the Dao or the Way.</h2><br />
