                                            One of the most common alterations to which gasoline is submitted is the addition of ethanol to the fuel mixture in a proportion greater than that authorized by law. A simple technique to detect such adulteration consists of placing a volume of the gasoline sample to be analyzed and the same volume of water with salt in a beaker, stirring, leaving it to rest and observing, after some time, the formation of: a) a homogeneous mixture in which there are two components. b) a heterogeneous system in which there are two phases, one of which contains water, salt and ethanol. c) a solution with three phases, gasoline being the upper phase d) a three-phase heterogeneous material: the first phase consisting of salt water; the second for gasoline; and the third consisting of ethanol.This is very very good cause you'll gonna have 100pts. just for this and of course i brainlest you!​</a>

                                            Like any historical event, the causes of the Civil War were complicated, but the biggest underlying issue was the disagreement concerning slavery. Some historians have said that economics was the main cause. They argue that the agricultural system of the South was at odds with the industrial, free labor system of the North. The economy of the South revolved around agriculture and slavery. The South was completely committed to a single crop, cotton, which was picked entirely by slave labor. Therefore, virtually all of the labor in the South was slave labor. Many in the northern states felt that slavery was morally wrong, but this was just one cause for concern. The North also worried that slave labor would undermine the position of free white laborers. People in the North worried that the South had intentions to expand slavery, which would make it hard for white laborers to find work.
 Still other historians might argue that a rise in sectionalism was the cause of war. The nation seemed to be splitting down social and political lines, becoming two different cultures that embraced very different ideas. These cultures were most strongly divided, however, on the issue of allowing slavery and not allowing slavery. The southern states believed they had the right to practice slavery. To them, ending slavery would mean an end to their culture. Due to these societal differences, the North and South found it difficult to agree on political issues. The two areas of the country grew further apart until it seemed that war was inevitable.

Panganiban Globally,mobile phones are the biggest cause of accidents in what is now known as the "distracted driving syndrome." This situation arises when a driver takes his attention away from the road and his car to do something else while the automobile is in motion. In the Philippines, mobile phone use is the ranked as the 12th most common cause of traffic crashes based on the 2006 review of the National Statistic Coordination Board. From 2001 to 2006 alone, road crashes caused by the use of mobile phones increased five times or 500 percent, the highest rate of increase among traffic accident causes. Driving and texting is even worse. A Virginia Tech Institute study in July 2015 showed that texting while driving is 23 times more likely to cause a crash. In that study, drivers were noted to have travelled the distance of a football field without their eyes on the road. What is worse is that texting while driving is like driving blind for five seconds or equivalent to driving after five bottles of beer.  Questions: 1. What is the general statement of the text? 2.

Panganiban Globally,mobile phones are the biggest cause of accidents in what is now known as the "distracted driving syndrome." This situation arises when a driver takes his attention away from the road and his car to do something else while the automobile is in motion. In the Philippines, mobile phone use is the ranked as the 12th most common cause of traffic crashes based on the 2006 review of the National Statistic Coordination Board. From 2001 to 2006 alone, road crashes caused by the use of mobile phones increased five times or 500 percent, the highest rate of increase among traffic accident causes. Driving and texting is even worse. A Virginia Tech Institute study in July 2015 showed that texting while driving is 23 times more likely to cause a crash. In that study, drivers were noted to have travelled the distance of a football field without their eyes on the road. What is worse is that texting while driving is like driving blind for five seconds or equivalent to driving after five bottles of beer.  Questions: 1. What is the general statement of the text? 2.

                                            Amelia Earhart At the age of 23, Amelia Earhart took a ten-minute plane ride at a 1920 air show that changed her life—she knew she had to learn to fly. Because of her determination, she became a world-famous pilot. She also became a vice president in the airline industry. As a spokeswoman, she wrote and lectured about the time when flying would not be just for a few but would become an accepted part of everyday life. Earhart not only was inspirational to pilots, she broke down barriers for women. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. And that was just one of the many records she set throughout her career. Included in her accomplishments was being the first person to fly from Hawaii to California. She became the first person to make solo flights across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. All of these achievements opened opportunities for women in aviation. In 1937, Earhart attempted the first around-the-world flight at the equator. While attempting the stretch between New Guinea and Howland Island, a small island in the Pacific, Earhart and her navigator, Frederick Noonan, vanished. They were nearly two-thirds finished with the journey. No one ever found their bodies or the ultimate cause of their deaths. Recently, a piece of aluminum found on a small Pacific island called Nikumaroro is believed to match a piece that was used to repair Earhart’s plane. Though Earhart died, her legacy of freedom, determination, and living out your dreams has lived on. READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS: 1. What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage? 2.

                                            Can you summarize this? 
Do the Covid vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus, or do they just protect you from getting sick?
Scientists don’t know yet—and the uncertainty has big implications during the rollout of the vaccines.
Pfizer and Moderna, the companies that developed the vaccines authorized in the U.S. so far, say their vaccines are about 95% effective at preventing people from getting sick with Covid symptoms. But there’s not enough evidence yet on whether the vaccines also prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission.
The companies say research is ongoing to determine the answer. Without vaccines, research has suggested that asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus that causes Covid is responsible for roughly a quarter of infections.</a>

                            13. One of the most common alterations to which gasoline is submitted is the addition of ethanol to the fuel mixture in a proportion greater than that authorized by law. A simple technique to detect such adulteration consists of placing a volume of the gasoline sample to be analyzed and the same volume of water with salt in a beaker, stirring, leaving it to rest and observing, after some time, the formation of: a) a homogeneous mixture in which there are two components. b) a heterogeneous system in which there are two phases, one of which contains water, salt and ethanol. c) a solution with three phases, gasoline being the upper phase d) a three-phase heterogeneous material: the first phase consisting of salt water; the second for gasoline; and the third consisting of ethanol.This is very very good cause you'll gonna have 100pts. just for this and of course i brainlest you!​</h2><br />

Meanwhile, water and ethanol will form another phase, as both are polar liquids and like dissolves like.

Life feels like a massive rehearsal for every person you have to talk to, for every situation you have to attend,which just falls apart into wild swings of arrogance and timidity.Growing up didn't help with the awkwardness. There were just so many opportunities lost because I justcould not get what was before me - how I should react to it or deal with it.But growing up helped with coping. Even when an interaction is just a pile of your actions shattering into"Huh?" or "What?" or that other person's stare of bewilderment with matching eyebrows raised the best wayto deal with it is to not dwell on it too much.You are doing fine even when you are all over the place, because the mistakes you earn and the memories ofembarrassments past help in some way to try again and get it right with the right person.[...] And what growing up taught me most is that people come and go; what matters is the memories you hadwith them when they stayed You are the constant in this coming and going, so what will always matter is thatyou become a better person than yourself, and that you find mearing in all this clumsy struggling.

                            18. Like any historical event, the causes of the Civil War were complicated, but the biggest underlying issue was the disagreement concerning slavery. Some historians have said that economics was the main cause. They argue that the agricultural system of the South was at odds with the industrial, free labor system of the North. The economy of the South revolved around agriculture and slavery. The South was completely committed to a single crop, cotton, which was picked entirely by slave labor. Therefore, virtually all of the labor in the South was slave labor. Many in the northern states felt that slavery was morally wrong, but this was just one cause for concern. The North also worried that slave labor would undermine the position of free white laborers. People in the North worried that the South had intentions to expand slavery, which would make it hard for white laborers to find work.
 Still other historians might argue that a rise in sectionalism was the cause of war. The nation seemed to be splitting down social and political lines, becoming two different cultures that embraced very different ideas. These cultures were most strongly divided, however, on the issue of allowing slavery and not allowing slavery. The southern states believed they had the right to practice slavery. To them, ending slavery would mean an end to their culture. Due to these societal differences, the North and South found it difficult to agree on political issues. The two areas of the country grew further apart until it seemed that war was inevitable.

Panganiban Globally,mobile phones are the biggest cause of accidents in what is now known as the "distracted driving syndrome." This situation arises when a driver takes his attention away from the road and his car to do something else while the automobile is in motion. In the Philippines, mobile phone use is the ranked as the 12th most common cause of traffic crashes based on the 2006 review of the National Statistic Coordination Board. From 2001 to 2006 alone, road crashes caused by the use of mobile phones increased five times or 500 percent, the highest rate of increase among traffic accident causes. Driving and texting is even worse. A Virginia Tech Institute study in July 2015 showed that texting while driving is 23 times more likely to cause a crash. In that study, drivers were noted to have travelled the distance of a football field without their eyes on the road. What is worse is that texting while driving is like driving blind for five seconds or equivalent to driving after five bottles of beer.  Questions: 1. What is the general statement of the text? 2. What evidence were cited to support the general statement? 3. What kind of evidence were these (examples, anecdotes, logical reasons, facts, statistics, expert testimony)? 4. How did the author of the article cite the evidence (direct quotation, paraphrasing, giving the source)? 5. What did you learn from the text you just learned?​</h2><br />

                            25. Amelia Earhart At the age of 23, Amelia Earhart took a ten-minute plane ride at a 1920 air show that changed her life—she knew she had to learn to fly. Because of her determination, she became a world-famous pilot. She also became a vice president in the airline industry. As a spokeswoman, she wrote and lectured about the time when flying would not be just for a few but would become an accepted part of everyday life. Earhart not only was inspirational to pilots, she broke down barriers for women. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. And that was just one of the many records she set throughout her career. Included in her accomplishments was being the first person to fly from Hawaii to California. She became the first person to make solo flights across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. All of these achievements opened opportunities for women in aviation. In 1937, Earhart attempted the first around-the-world flight at the equator. While attempting the stretch between New Guinea and Howland Island, a small island in the Pacific, Earhart and her navigator, Frederick Noonan, vanished. They were nearly two-thirds finished with the journey. No one ever found their bodies or the ultimate cause of their deaths. Recently, a piece of aluminum found on a small Pacific island called Nikumaroro is believed to match a piece that was used to repair Earhart’s plane. Though Earhart died, her legacy of freedom, determination, and living out your dreams has lived on. READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS: 1. What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage? 2.

Scientists don’t know yet—and the uncertainty has big implications during the rollout of the vaccines.
Pfizer and Moderna, the companies that developed the vaccines authorized in the U.S. so far, say their vaccines are about 95% effective at preventing people from getting sick with Covid symptoms. But there’s not enough evidence yet on whether the vaccines also prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission.
The companies say research is ongoing to determine the answer. Without vaccines, research has suggested that asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus that causes Covid is responsible for roughly a quarter of infections.</h2><br />

What did the narrator learn from the devastation caused by the typhoon? -6 Why is it claimed that the school has a special role to play in the aftermath of a tragedy such as Typhoon Yolanda? -7 Explain Edward Said’s assertion on the role of teachers in society. ​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p>The article is entitled "Braving Storms" because it talks about the resilience and courage of the people affected by Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines who faced and endured the devastating storm.The article says that Typhoon Yolanda would go down in history as one of the strongest and deadliest typhoons that hit the Philippines. It caused massive destruction, loss of lives, and displacement of people. I agree with this observation as Typhoon Yolanda was indeed a tragic event that left a significant impact on the Philippines and its people.The narrator's attitude toward the victims of the typhoon is sympathetic and compassionate. The narrator acknowledges the sufferings and difficulties that the victims faced and highlights their strength and resilience in facing the disaster.The narrator saw the disaster in a positive light because it brought out the best in people, particularly in terms of their courage, determination, and willingness to help others in need. Although such disasters do not happen every day, the narrator points out that people's response to adversity can be inspiring and uplifting.From the devastation caused by the typhoon, the narrator learned the importance of resilience, courage, and hope in facing difficult situations. The narrator also learned the value of empathy and compassion in understanding the plight of others and helping them to recover from the disaster.The school has a special role to play in the aftermath of a tragedy such as Typhoon Yolanda because it can provide support, comfort, and assistance to students, families, and communities affected by the disaster. Schools can also help in the recovery process by providing education, counseling, and other resources to help people rebuild their lives.Edward Said asserts that teachers have a critical role to play in society as they are responsible for imparting knowledge, values, and critical thinking skills to students. He argues that teachers should not just transmit information but also help students to develop their own ideas, perspectives, and understanding of the world.
