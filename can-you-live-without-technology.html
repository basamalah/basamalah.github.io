To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

Read the text carefully and answer the questions that
follow. Write your answer on your pad paper.
Selection 1
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching
her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the
sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the
doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books
and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye
and when she came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This
happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood.
-excerpt from Araby by James Joyce

For Conversation, press #1
by Michael Alvear
A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently and his cellphone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.
The park was filled with people talking on their cellphones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopiing to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.
the telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent.
Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, yo can just insert your card into the ATM. With vooice mail, you can conduct entire conversation without ever reaching anyone. If my Mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.
As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cellphone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn''t an option--They're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cellphoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when im home.

1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it
that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I
feel?"
2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of
article?
3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author’s
opinion? Why or why not?</a>

                                            Activity 4. Read to Find the Evidence Read the text below, then answer the questions that follow. For Conversation, Press #1by Michael Alvear I’ve got a cell phone, e-mail, and voice mail. So why am I so lonely? A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and–poof!–I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.  The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Recently I was in a car with three friends. The driver shushed the rest of us because he could not hear the person on the other end of his cell phone. There we were, four friends zooming down the highway, unable to talk to one another because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.  Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.  As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. You can’t even call a person to get the phone number of another person anymore. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated.  Pumping gas at the station? Why say good- morning to the attendant when you can swipe your credit card at the pump and save yourself the bother of human contact?  Making a deposit at the bank? Why talk to a clerk who might live in the neighborhood when you can just insert your card into the ATM?  Pretty soon you won’t have the burden of making eye contact at the grocery store. Some supermarket chains are using a self-scanner so you can check yourself out, avoiding those annoying clerks who look at you and ask how you are doing.  I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, an e-mail account. Giving them up isn’t an option–they’re great for what they’re intended to do. It’s their unintended consequences that make me cringe. More and more, I find myself hiding behind e-mail to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail picked up because I didn’t really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier–or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I’ve put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I’m home.  What good is all this gee-whiz technology if there’s no one in the room to hear you exclaim, “Gee whiz”?A.

                                            SELECTION 2 C For Conversation, Press # 1 by Michael Alvear A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, you can just insert your card into the ATM. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets auto- mated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn't an option---they're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm home. Readers Digest, pp. 143-145, July 2000 Questions: 1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel?" 2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of article? 3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author's opinion? Why or why not?​</a>

Middleclass girls, like princesses, wore bows, ruffles, and pastels as a symbol of their distinctiveness. 31. In reality, the reason why we want to choose our own clothes and other stuff is to satisfy our own desire and fashion taste. 32. The more we fulfill our wants and desire in terms of fashion accessories, the more we feel happy and light 33. Despite of emerging technologies, other people such as those who are living in the mountain still uphold the values and culture they inherited from their predecessor 34. There is an importance of using the right tool for the job because it is designed for a specific purpose 35. Glass is an extruded metal and is quite versatile in jewellery-making because it can hold its shape 36. The larger the gauge, the larger the diameter of the wire 37. Expensive imitations of gemstones are made from colored glass, plastic, or clay 38. Ivory is used for pendants, bracelets, rings, earrings. pins, beads.

                                            Explaining Natural PhenomenaPerhaps you have murmured the expression "tabi tabi po, makikiraan lang " while passing by an old tree or crossing a rice field. Our elders taught us to say this expression so the dwarves, elves, fairies or spirits believed to be living in the tree or rice field would not hurt us. This practice might have started when someone passed by a tree or crossed a rice field and then got sick. Without the modern knowledge and technology we have today, our ancestors made up their own explanation that the unknown beings got angry with the person, and so he got sick.ln this lesson, we will try to give scientific explanations for some natural phenomena to remove some common misconceptions about them.Father - Come on, Dante. The full moon is out and it would be a good time to plant ar rice seedlings. Son - Bt, Father, isn't it late for planting? Why don`t we wait until tomorrow?Father - It is best toplat when there's a full mom because the good spirits aceat tonight and they will help make ar harvest bartin Son - Rally Father?

To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate.

Selection 1
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching
her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the
sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the
doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books
and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye
and when she came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This
happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood.
-excerpt from Araby by James Joyce

Selection 2
For Conversation, press #1
by Michael Alvear
A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently and his cellphone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.
The park was filled with people talking on their cellphones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopiing to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.
the telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent.
Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, yo can just insert your card into the ATM. With vooice mail, you can conduct entire conversation without ever reaching anyone. If my Mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.
As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cellphone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn''t an option--They're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cellphoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when im home.
Questions:
1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it
that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I
feel?"
2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of
article?
3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author’s
opinion? Why or why not?</h2><br />

                            23. Activity 4. Read to Find the Evidence Read the text below, then answer the questions that follow. For Conversation, Press #1by Michael Alvear I’ve got a cell phone, e-mail, and voice mail. So why am I so lonely? A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and–poof!–I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.  The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Recently I was in a car with three friends. The driver shushed the rest of us because he could not hear the person on the other end of his cell phone. There we were, four friends zooming down the highway, unable to talk to one another because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.  Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.  As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. You can’t even call a person to get the phone number of another person anymore. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated.  Pumping gas at the station? Why say good- morning to the attendant when you can swipe your credit card at the pump and save yourself the bother of human contact?  Making a deposit at the bank? Why talk to a clerk who might live in the neighborhood when you can just insert your card into the ATM?  Pretty soon you won’t have the burden of making eye contact at the grocery store. Some supermarket chains are using a self-scanner so you can check yourself out, avoiding those annoying clerks who look at you and ask how you are doing.  I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, an e-mail account. Giving them up isn’t an option–they’re great for what they’re intended to do. It’s their unintended consequences that make me cringe. More and more, I find myself hiding behind e-mail to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail picked up because I didn’t really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier–or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I’ve put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I’m home.  What good is all this gee-whiz technology if there’s no one in the room to hear you exclaim, “Gee whiz”?A.

                            25. SELECTION 2 C For Conversation, Press # 1 by Michael Alvear A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, you can just insert your card into the ATM. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets auto- mated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn't an option---they're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I'm home. Readers Digest, pp. 143-145, July 2000 Questions: 1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel?" 2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of article? 3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author's opinion? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Due to less connectivity with the people and belongingness there is a loneliness and depression creates in a human technology is one of the main cause these days that creates disconnected from everyone and there will remain no social life.</p><p></p><p>2. I believe that the author came up with this kind of article is to remind us that because of our addiction to gadgets nowadays, we don't enjoy life as much as possible. Remember, we only live once so we need to savor and enjoy every single moment-memorable or horrible.</p><p></p><p>3. I strongly agree with the author's opinion. As a person who also became addicted to my phone and social media that sometimes I forget to do important tasks like studying. I also don't get to enjoy life. I remember that whenever we would travel, I would always be on my phone or I would be looking for wifi. But I think the beauty of traveling allows me to leave my gadgets and appreciate the world. Our gadgets may be useful right now with online classes and research.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Credits:FTO</p><br />

                            27. Explaining Natural PhenomenaPerhaps you have murmured the expression "tabi tabi po, makikiraan lang " while passing by an old tree or crossing a rice field. Our elders taught us to say this expression so the dwarves, elves, fairies or spirits believed to be living in the tree or rice field would not hurt us. This practice might have started when someone passed by a tree or crossed a rice field and then got sick. Without the modern knowledge and technology we have today, our ancestors made up their own explanation that the unknown beings got angry with the person, and so he got sick.ln this lesson, we will try to give scientific explanations for some natural phenomena to remove some common misconceptions about them.Father - Come on, Dante. The full moon is out and it would be a good time to plant ar rice seedlings. Son - Bt, Father, isn't it late for planting?
