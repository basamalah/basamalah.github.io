Primatologists, physical anthropologists, and paleoanthropologists have agreed that the modern-day primates one finds in the wild, or in zoos will eventually develop into an anatomically modern-day human. _________________4. Our ancestors as humans lived on land and water. _________________5. One major factor why our early human ancestors developed the ability and the skill to speak is not only attributed to the gradual narrowing of the mouth and larynx over time, but also to FOXP2, the speech gene found on chromosome 7 of our DNA, which contributes to evolution. _________________6. From tree-dwelling existence toward land-dwelling adaptation, this new survival pattern adopted by the early hominids is known as arboreality. _________________7. The story of creation historically formed the basis of evolution _________________8. Brain size expansion or the gradual increase of the human brain, of our pre-human ancestors from 300cc to 1000cc is known as terrestrialism. _________________9. The early human ancestors included Homo Erectus which was not only found in Africa but also in Asia. _________________10. Modern man and woman’s distinction and uniqueness from the animal world is attributed to their capacity to rationalize their behavior before conducting any future action as well as the ability to utilize symbols during the communication process. ​</a>
