                            1. Reflection Paper about Traditional Arts and Contemporary Arts.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Traditional arts and contemporary arts are two distinct yet interconnected forms of artistic expression. Traditional arts are often rooted in cultural practices and beliefs that have been passed down through generations, while contemporary arts are more recent forms of artistic expression that reflect the current social and cultural context.</p><p></p><p>One of the main differences between traditional and contemporary arts is their approach to innovation. Traditional arts tend to value the preservation of the past, often maintaining the same techniques and materials used by previous generations. In contrast, contemporary arts prioritize experimentation, pushing boundaries and exploring new techniques and media.</p><p></p><p>However, while traditional arts may appear stagnant on the surface, they are in fact constantly evolving, adapting to new influences and challenges. This is particularly evident in the way traditional arts are passed down from one generation to the next, with each new generation adding their own interpretations and innovations to the art form.</p><p></p><p>Contemporary arts, on the other hand, are often more focused on individual expression and pushing the boundaries of what is considered art. Contemporary artists are not bound by tradition or conventions, and are free to experiment with new techniques and materials.</p><p></p><p>Despite these differences, traditional and contemporary arts are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many contemporary artists draw inspiration from traditional arts, incorporating elements of traditional techniques, materials and themes into their work. This fusion of traditional and contemporary styles has resulted in a vibrant and diverse artistic landscape, where artists are constantly exploring new ways to express themselves.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, both traditional and contemporary arts have their own unique strengths and value. While traditional arts are deeply rooted in culture and history, contemporary arts are more focused on individual expression and innovation. However, rather than seeing these two forms of artistic expression as separate entities, it is important to recognize their interconnectedness and the ways in which they inform and influence each other.</p><br />

                            2. Reflection Paper About Subject Of Arts and The Principles Of Design.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The subject of arts and the principles of design are incredibly important for any artist or designer to understand. The principles of design provide the foundation for creating aesthetically pleasing works of art, and they can be applied to any medium. The principles of design include balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, pattern, rhythm, and unity. Balance is the distribution of elements in a composition, while contrast is the comparison of elements in a composition. Emphasis is the focal point of the composition, and movement is the visual flow of the composition. Pattern is the repetition of elements, rhythm is the repetition of elements in a regular or cyclical manner, and unity is the sense of harmony in a composition.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the principles of design is essential for any artist or designer, as it allows them to create works of art that are visually appealing and harmonious. With a good understanding of these principles, any artist or designer can create beautiful works of art that will stand the test of time.</p><p></p><br />

Philippine art has also been influenced by a variety of foreign cultures and traditions, including Spanish, American, and Chinese.</p><p>12. One way that the arts in the Philippines have changed is through the increasing use of modern materials and technologies.</p><p>13. For example, many contemporary Philippine artists use digital media to create their art, in addition to traditional materials such as paint and clay.</p><p>14. Another way that the arts in the Philippines have changed is through the increasing diversity of subject matter and themes.</p><p>15. In the past, Philippine art often focused on specific themes, such as religion or folklore.</p><p>16. Today, Philippine artists are more likely to explore a wider range of themes and subjects in their art, such as social issues and personal experiences.</p><p>17. The arts in the Philippines have also become more inclusive, with more artists from diverse backgrounds and communities participating in the art scene.</p><p>18. Overall, the arts in the Philippines have evolved and changed over time, reflecting the changing values and perspectives of Philippine society.</p><p>19. While the arts of the past played a crucial role in preserving and promoting traditional cultural practices, the arts of today are more focused on exploring new ideas and expressing contemporary experiences.</p><p>20. The arts in the Philippines continue to be a vital part of the country's culture and identity, reflecting the diversity and complexity of Philippine society.</p><p>21. The arts also play an important role in shaping the values and perspectives of Philippine culture, encouraging creativity, self-expression, and critical thinking.</p><p>22. As such, the arts are an essential aspect of Philippine society, and should be valued and supported by all members of the community.</p><p>23. In conclusion, the arts in Asia and the Philippines have changed and evolved over time, reflecting the diverse and dynamic nature of these cultures.</p><p>24. While traditional arts continue to hold a special place in these cultures, contemporary arts are also vital in reflecting the changing values and experiences of today's world.</p><p>25. By engaging with and supporting the arts, we can better understand and appreciate the rich and diverse cultures of Asia and the Philippines, and the important role that the arts play in shaping our world.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Hermeneutic Analysis</p><p></p><p></p>About phenomenology<p> <strong>Phenomenology</strong> is a study in terms of philosophy that studies human as a phenomenon.  The <strong>science</strong> of phenomonology in philosophy is usually associated with the science of hermeneutics, namely the science that studies the benefits of this phenomenon.</p><p></p><p> This term was first introduced by <strong>Johann Heinrich Lambert</strong> (1728 - 1777), a German philosopher.  In his book Neues Organon (1764).  he wrote about unreal knowledge.</p><p></p><p> In the literary approach, <strong>phenomenology</strong> uses the intuitive experience of phenomena, something that has a phenomenological reflection, as a starting point and effort to get to the nature of experience and the nature of what we experience.  G.W.F.  Hegel and Edmund Husserl are two important figures in the development of this philosophical approach.</p><p></p><p> The <strong>phenomenological tradition</strong> concentrates on personal experience including the realm of individuals who actually share experiences with one another.  Communication is seen as a round of sharing experiences or information between individuals through discussion.  Good relations between individuals have a high position in this tradition.  In this tradition, it is said that language represents a meaning for objects.  So, just one word can give meaning to something that will be interpreted.</p><p></p><p> Fundamentally, phenomenology is a tradition of study used to explore human experience.  As stated by Littlejohn that phenomenology is a tradition to explore human experience.  In this <strong>context</strong>, the assumption is correct that humans actively understand the world around them as a life experience and actively interpret that experience.</p><p> The main <strong>assumption</strong> of phenomenology is that humans actively interpret their experiences by providing a formula for something they experience.  Therefore interpretation is an active process to provide a formula for something that is experienced by humans.  In other words understanding is a creative action, namely action towards meaning.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about <strong>phenomenology</strong> at https://brainly.ph/question/987790.</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
