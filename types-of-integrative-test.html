Given the excerpt from a research conducted by Herrero (2018), analyze the research instrument used based on the following criteria. NUMERACY INVENTORY DEVICE (NID): BASIS FOR CRAFTING STRATEGIC INTERVENTION MATERIALS (SIM) IN MATHEMATICS Rico A Herraro Researchinsinament In order for the researcher to calhes necessary date, the netaarcher devised a tool called the Numeracy inventory Device DaD) which measured the student numeracy skills. This was composed of 80 items test which underwent validation by the mathematics experts such as master teacherz test teachez etc. Moreover in order to establish not only the validity of the device but also the relabidity, sophisticated hett analysis was also conducted Out of these Bitems, 56 good questions were retained and became part of the device. The questions covered the followng areas. Whole Numbers Signed Numbers, Fractions. Dacinate, and Percentages After estabirching the device's validity and reliabilay, the resserchers conducted the supertory to randomly selected student respondents from grades saven of Punta Integrated School and Integrated School of Lawa. After the administration, the researchers interpreted the students numeracy skills as to advanced proficient, bauc and below testo. Through these data, the researchers also found out the students' shengths and weaknesses, in terms of numbers made them the bass in designing intervention materials to improve the students mathematics skils. 1.

This was composed of 80 items test which underwent validation by the mathematics experts such as master teacherz test teachez etc. Moreover in order to establish not only the validity of the device but also the relabidity, sophisticated hett analysis was also conducted Out of these Bitems, 56 good questions were retained and became part of the device. The questions covered the followng areas. Whole Numbers Signed Numbers, Fractions. Dacinate, and Percentages After estabirching the device's validity and reliabilay, the resserchers conducted the supertory to randomly selected student respondents from grades saven of Punta Integrated School and Integrated School of Lawa. After the administration, the researchers interpreted the students numeracy skills as to advanced proficient, bauc and below testo. Through these data, the researchers also found out the students' shengths and weaknesses, in terms of numbers made them the bass in designing intervention materials to improve the students mathematics skils. 1.

Why is important to keep integrity of data that are store and entered in the database?4. What are the types of relationship in MS Access? Describe each relationship?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In a relational database, relationships enable you to prevent redundant data. For example, if you are designing a database that will track information about books, you might have a table named "Titles" that stores information about each book, such as the book's title, date of publication, and publisher. There is also information that you might want to store about the publisher, such as the publisher's telephone number, address, and ZIP Code/Postal Code. If you were to store all this information in the "Titles" table, the publisher's telephone number would be duplicated for each title that the publisher prints.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A better solution is to store the publisher's information only one time, in a separate table that we will call "Publishers." You would then put a pointer in the "Titles" table that references an entry in the "Publishers" table.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To make sure that you data stays synchronized, you can enforce referential integrity between tables. Referential integrity relationships help make sure that information in one table matches information in another. For example, each title in the "Titles" table must be associated with a specific publisher in the "Publishers" table. A title cannot be added to the database for a publisher that does not exist in the database.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Logical relationships in a database enable you to efficiently query data and create reports.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>That,s it</p><p> </p><p>Can you mark me pls gonna need it</p><br />
