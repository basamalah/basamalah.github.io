                                            Elevator StoryOne day, a simple man from the bomo, with his wife and son, visited the city. It was theirfirst time - and what a shock it was. Everything was new to them: the high-rise buildings, the fastcars, and the malls. Upon entering a mall, the wite ran off by herself overwhelmed by thenumber of goods for sale.The father and his son walked more cautiously, awed by their surroundings. In the middleof the mall, they saw something totally mysterious to them: two shiny silver doors that sild awayfrom each other and back towards each other again. Above it was a blinking light. The boyasked his father "What is that, Papa?""Some type of machine. I don't really know what it is, son," the father replied, "Let's seewhat will happen." As they spoke, an old woman slowly walked through the shiny doors. Beforethe doors closed, the old woman turned around and faced them. They were able to clearly seeher fired, wrinkled face and gnarled hands holding her cane. She smiled at them, revealing afew missing teeth. And then the doors shut.Above the doors, the light blinked again a number of times. And when the doorsopened, lo and behold, out came a beautiful young woman! Their jaws dropped in total shock.After a few moments, the father grabbed his boy's shoulder and said, "Quicki Go find yourmother!"Source: Kerygma Magazine, The Bass, 2006​</a>

                                            True or False 9) The persecutions caused the early Christians to give up on their mission of spreading the Church.  10) If God is with us, we can endure everything, even death.  11) Before his conversion, Paul formerly called Saul, actively took part in the persecution of the Christians.  12) It is the Church who reveals to the world the mystery of the Lord.  13) The Church gathers people from various cultures and nations.  14) Liturgical celebrations (Mass) can be adapted to the culture of the people gathered.  15) Church members are only connected by visible bonds of unity.  16) Church is made up of both human and divine elements.  17) The Catholic Church has a relationship with religions that do not share the belief in one God.  18) Church is one because God is one.  19) One of the essential characteristics of the Church is HELPFUL.  20) Apostles' Creed or Nicene Creed summarizes the truths about the Church.  21) In the New Testament, Church means "an assembly of called-out ones." It refers to a people.  22) Each of us is called by Christ to do our part in taking responsibility for building a just society.  23) Following and imitating Christ is the moral life of Christians through our response of what our mind conceived.  24) Knowing well about the nature and mission of the Church, we will be more zealous in doing that which is good, true and right. 25) The Letter of Luke teaches us that it is because of Christ Jesus that we become one family.  26) Tracing the origin of the term Church as “kerygma”, the Church is the gathering of people being called by God.  27) The truths hidden in God can only be revealed by the Church thus the mystery of His Trinitarian indwelling is beyond full human understanding unless one looks at it with the eyes of faith.  28) As a sacrament (a sign that gives grace), the Church has a distinct relationship with Christ, is an instrument of intimate union with God. In her the unity of all mankind is impossible. 29) As the Kingdom of God on earth, the Church is shown in the teaching of Jesus read in the Gospels.  30) It is the Holy Spirit, alive and fruitful in Christ’s body who animates its movements.  31) Jesus Christ, who founded the Church as His body, wills that its mission is guided by the Holy Spirit and survive in spite of the trials. 32) Saint Callistus, a controversial figure in the early Church, established a rival bishopric against Rome.  33) Jesus encourages good deeds from a receptive conscience of those who desire to follow Him.  34) The mission of Christ is the mission of the Church.  35) The mission of the Church is for all peoples, especially the poor and marginalized.</a>

Everything was new to them: the high-rise buildings, the fastcars, and the malls. Upon entering a mall, the wite ran off by herself overwhelmed by thenumber of goods for sale.The father and his son walked more cautiously, awed by their surroundings. In the middleof the mall, they saw something totally mysterious to them: two shiny silver doors that sild awayfrom each other and back towards each other again. Above it was a blinking light. The boyasked his father "What is that, Papa?""Some type of machine. I don't really know what it is, son," the father replied, "Let's seewhat will happen." As they spoke, an old woman slowly walked through the shiny doors. Beforethe doors closed, the old woman turned around and faced them. They were able to clearly seeher fired, wrinkled face and gnarled hands holding her cane. She smiled at them, revealing afew missing teeth. And then the doors shut.Above the doors, the light blinked again a number of times. And when the doorsopened, lo and behold, out came a beautiful young woman! Their jaws dropped in total shock.After a few moments, the father grabbed his boy's shoulder and said, "Quicki Go find yourmother!"Source: Kerygma Magazine, The Bass, 2006​</h2><br />

                            10. True or False 9) The persecutions caused the early Christians to give up on their mission of spreading the Church.  10) If God is with us, we can endure everything, even death.  11) Before his conversion, Paul formerly called Saul, actively took part in the persecution of the Christians.  12) It is the Church who reveals to the world the mystery of the Lord.  13) The Church gathers people from various cultures and nations.  14) Liturgical celebrations (Mass) can be adapted to the culture of the people gathered.  15) Church members are only connected by visible bonds of unity.  16) Church is made up of both human and divine elements.  17) The Catholic Church has a relationship with religions that do not share the belief in one God.  18) Church is one because God is one.  19) One of the essential characteristics of the Church is HELPFUL.  20) Apostles' Creed or Nicene Creed summarizes the truths about the Church.  21) In the New Testament, Church means "an assembly of called-out ones." It refers to a people.  22) Each of us is called by Christ to do our part in taking responsibility for building a just society.  23) Following and imitating Christ is the moral life of Christians through our response of what our mind conceived.  24) Knowing well about the nature and mission of the Church, we will be more zealous in doing that which is good, true and right. 25) The Letter of Luke teaches us that it is because of Christ Jesus that we become one family.  26) Tracing the origin of the term Church as “kerygma”, the Church is the gathering of people being called by God.  27) The truths hidden in God can only be revealed by the Church thus the mystery of His Trinitarian indwelling is beyond full human understanding unless one looks at it with the eyes of faith.  28) As a sacrament (a sign that gives grace), the Church has a distinct relationship with Christ, is an instrument of intimate union with God. In her the unity of all mankind is impossible. 29) As the Kingdom of God on earth, the Church is shown in the teaching of Jesus read in the Gospels.  30) It is the Holy Spirit, alive and fruitful in Christ’s body who animates its movements.  31) Jesus Christ, who founded the Church as His body, wills that its mission is guided by the Holy Spirit and survive in spite of the trials. 32) Saint Callistus, a controversial figure in the early Church, established a rival bishopric against Rome.  33) Jesus encourages good deeds from a receptive conscience of those who desire to follow Him.  34) The mission of Christ is the mission of the Church.  35) The mission of the Church is for all peoples, especially the poor and marginalized.</h2><br />
