                                            Direction: Read the passage and from the text and answer the questions that follow. Sound Waves All sounds begin with vibrating matter. For example, a guitar string vibrates when it is plucked. The vibrating string repeatedly pushes against the air particles next to it. The pressure of the vibrating string causes these air particles to vibrate. The air particles alternately push together and spread apart. This starts waves of vibrations that travel through the air in all directions away from the strings. The vibrations pass through the air as longitudinal waves, with individual air particles vibrating back and forth in the same direction that the sound waves travel. Sound waves are mechanical waves, so they can travel only though matter and not through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could no longer be heard. That's because the sound couldn't travel away from the clock without particles of matter to pass the sound energy along. Sound waves can travel through many different kinds of matter. Most of the sounds we hear travel through air, but sounds can also travel through liquids such as water and solids such as glass and metal. If you swim underwater or even submerge your ears in bathwater-−any sounds you hear have traveled to your ears through water. You can tell that sounds travel through glass and other solids because you can hear loud outdoor sounds such as sirens through closed windows and doors. 1. How do sound waves begin and how do they travel?2. How di Robert Boyle demonstrate that sound waves cannot travel through empty space?3. Most sound we hear travel through air. From your own experience, what evidence do you have that sounds can also travel through liquids and solids? Nonsense/Unhelpful/Copied = Report ​</a>

                                            The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you

Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</a>

This massive disruption could lead to natural disasters all over the world. The biggest meteor to hit the Earth was the Chelyabinsk meteor that hit Russia in 2013, resulting in injuries to over 1,000 people and millions of dollars in property damage.Nostradamus:In the sky, one sees fire and a long trail of sparksDiscover more on the next pageA great famineAnother Nostradamus prediction warns of a great famine that will surpass anything the world has experienced before. Up until now, the single worst famine in history was the Great Leap Forward famine that occurred in China from 1959 until 1961, resulting in approximately 15-55 million deaths... Nostradamus:After great trouble for humanity, a greater one is preparedThe Great Mover renews the ages: rain, blood, milk, famine, steel, and plagueIs the heavens fire seen, a long spark runningIf Nostradamus can truly predict the future and famine spreads around the world, how will anyone be prepared for his final and most terrifying prediction for the year 2021?6. Solar stormsNostradamus also predicted that solar flares will have a huge impact on Earth. Solar flares are bursts of radiation that appear as bright spots on the sun. They’re also the biggest explosions present in our solar system. Nostradamus:We shall see the water rising and the earth falling under itSome of these flares can block out radio and other kinds of communications networks on Earth. If those are ordinary flares, what happens if there’s a flare of catastrophic proportions?5. Brain chips for American soldiersIn order to save the human race, American soldiers will have chips implanted in their brains. Artificial intelligence will lead these men and women to protect the world.Nostradamus:The newly made one will lead the armyAlmost cut off up to near the bankHelp from the Milana is elite strainingThe Duke deprived of his eyes in Milan in an iron cage4. Overcoming cancerNostradamus does not only predict doom and gloom. For example, he expects a cure for cancer to be discovered in 2021. And its cure should arise from unexpected cooperation between countries, namely China, Russia, and the United States.Nostradamus:Humanity will put an end to its great fluThe day is coming when we will no longer be tied down by the medical blackThe great east and west will come together and pave the way to a healthy futureWill 2021 be a more healthy and prosperous year? Who knows! Let's read more predictions!.[tex] (nasa \:inyo \: napo \: kung \: e \: report \: niyo \: o \: hindi \: basta \: basahin \: niyo \: muna)[/tex]Sana basahin niyo​</a>

After reigning for 70 years the queen died at the age of 96. (body) Elizabeth was born on April 21, 1926, and she never expected to ascend to the throne. However, when Elizabeth's uncle, Edward Vill, abdicated in 1936, her father George VI became the king, and she became heir to the throne. She was only 25 when she became the queen, and Winston Churchill was the first of 15 prime ministers that served with her. During her reign, 14 US presidents served. Elizabeth married Prince Phillip, and their marriage remained solid for 74 years, until his death in April2021. The couple had four children, and Charles, born in 1948, has now become the king (conclusion) Most people described Elizabeth as a dignified, down-to-earth, and witty woman whose lifelong passions, aside from her public duties, were horse racing and corgisYOUR TURN:Summary of Daedalus and Icarus storyIcarus was the son of Daedalus, the craftsman who built the Labyrinth (which featured in the story of Theseus and the Minotaur which we've discussed in a previous post). But after Daedalus aided Ariadne by telling her how Theseus could escape the Labyrinth he'd designed, King Minos locked Daedalus and his son, Icarus, inside the maze.Ever the inventor, Daedalus fashioned some wings out of feathers and wax, for him and his son to use to fly their way off the island of Crete. They escaped and flew up into the sky Daedalus warned his son not to fly too close to the sun; however, Icarus got carried away an promptly did just that, upon which the wax in his wings melted. He fell to his death, drowning the sea surrounding the island of Samos, a sea which is now named after him. Daedalus reache Cumae and then took refuge at Camicos on the isle of Sicily.​</a>

                            5. Direction: Read the passage and from the text and answer the questions that follow. Sound Waves All sounds begin with vibrating matter. For example, a guitar string vibrates when it is plucked. The vibrating string repeatedly pushes against the air particles next to it. The pressure of the vibrating string causes these air particles to vibrate. The air particles alternately push together and spread apart. This starts waves of vibrations that travel through the air in all directions away from the strings. The vibrations pass through the air as longitudinal waves, with individual air particles vibrating back and forth in the same direction that the sound waves travel. Sound waves are mechanical waves, so they can travel only though matter and not through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could no longer be heard. That's because the sound couldn't travel away from the clock without particles of matter to pass the sound energy along. Sound waves can travel through many different kinds of matter. Most of the sounds we hear travel through air, but sounds can also travel through liquids such as water and solids such as glass and metal. If you swim underwater or even submerge your ears in bathwater-−any sounds you hear have traveled to your ears through water. You can tell that sounds travel through glass and other solids because you can hear loud outdoor sounds such as sirens through closed windows and doors. 1. How do sound waves begin and how do they travel?2. How di Robert Boyle demonstrate that sound waves cannot travel through empty space?3. Most sound we hear travel through air.

                            7. The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</h2><br />

Nasa inyo po kung gusto niyong e report report niyo lang Pero basahin niyo muna ..(≧▽≦)(◔‿◔)An asteroidNostradamus’s final prediction for the year 2021 is that a comet or an asteroid will come dangerously close to hitting the planet. This massive disruption could lead to natural disasters all over the world. The biggest meteor to hit the Earth was the Chelyabinsk meteor that hit Russia in 2013, resulting in injuries to over 1,000 people and millions of dollars in property damage.Nostradamus:In the sky, one sees fire and a long trail of sparksDiscover more on the next pageA great famineAnother Nostradamus prediction warns of a great famine that will surpass anything the world has experienced before. Up until now, the single worst famine in history was the Great Leap Forward famine that occurred in China from 1959 until 1961, resulting in approximately 15-55 million deaths... Nostradamus:After great trouble for humanity, a greater one is preparedThe Great Mover renews the ages: rain, blood, milk, famine, steel, and plagueIs the heavens fire seen, a long spark runningIf Nostradamus can truly predict the future and famine spreads around the world, how will anyone be prepared for his final and most terrifying prediction for the year 2021?6. Solar stormsNostradamus also predicted that solar flares will have a huge impact on Earth. Solar flares are bursts of radiation that appear as bright spots on the sun. They’re also the biggest explosions present in our solar system. Nostradamus:We shall see the water rising and the earth falling under itSome of these flares can block out radio and other kinds of communications networks on Earth. If those are ordinary flares, what happens if there’s a flare of catastrophic proportions?5. Brain chips for American soldiersIn order to save the human race, American soldiers will have chips implanted in their brains. Artificial intelligence will lead these men and women to protect the world.Nostradamus:The newly made one will lead the armyAlmost cut off up to near the bankHelp from the Milana is elite strainingThe Duke deprived of his eyes in Milan in an iron cage4. Overcoming cancerNostradamus does not only predict doom and gloom. For example, he expects a cure for cancer to be discovered in 2021. And its cure should arise from unexpected cooperation between countries, namely China, Russia, and the United States.Nostradamus:Humanity will put an end to its great fluThe day is coming when we will no longer be tied down by the medical blackThe great east and west will come together and pave the way to a healthy futureWill 2021 be a more healthy and prosperous year?

After reigning for 70 years the queen died at the age of 96. (body) Elizabeth was born on April 21, 1926, and she never expected to ascend to the throne.

They escaped and flew up into the sky Daedalus warned his son not to fly too close to the sun; however, Icarus got carried away an promptly did just that, upon which the wax in his wings melted. He fell to his death, drowning the sea surrounding the island of Samos, a sea which is now named after him. Daedalus reache Cumae and then took refuge at Camicos on the isle of Sicily.​</h2><br />
