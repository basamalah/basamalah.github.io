Nowadays, more and more people are talking about this due to the fact that they want to become a better human being. And, this is achieved by being a better version of themselves through personal development.</p><p></p><p>In general, <strong>personal development</strong> is a topic found in the field of Psychology. This is because it deals with our mental well-being, among other things. However, the physical body is just as important in supporting the<strong> personal development </strong>as understood mentally. It is also an ongoing process.</p><p></p>After taking or attending seminar about personal development, here are things I have learned:<p></p>I can form a mental plan about how to be a better person in and out. This includes what is allowed and not allowed if we want ourselves to be better. Leaving out bad habits and embracing new habits are two examples.I feel like the path to becoming a better person is easier when I understand about it thoroughly. Before this course, I had a feeling that my effort is too vague, however it turned out to be quite simple as we navigate through the lesson offered and resources given.There are tons of resources I can read and do to support my effort in becoming a better person through <strong>personal development</strong>. This is included in my daily routine, and hopefully I can make it a habit (example: enough exercise and sleep). Reading the necessary resources about<strong> personal development</strong> inspire me to follow the writer's path, and I can take example from them so my own path will be clearer as well.<p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> the topic of personal development </strong>by visiting https://brainly.ph/question/2813089</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                            21.       In spite of the crisis we encountered at present, you still continue to pursue your studies. Your parents spare time to get the weekly modules, work hard to pay the monthly obligations, and monitor the activities in every subjects.      With all these at hand, how do you define the learning status you have at present? What are the challenges you have encountered with modular learning style? Cite at least 3 of these and discuss the ways on how did you face and overcome these challenges?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I define my learning status as hard. First, I get bombarded with new activities, since we get 3 school works in one day. Plus, i sometimes do not understand the lesson that our teacher is lecturing, that's why i have a hard time finishing my school works. Second, i go through family problems. Even though my family pays the monthly obligations and monitors the activities i pass, they pressure me by raising their voices and sometimes even humiliate me when i don't do well on my school works. They always compare me to the other students whom are actually doing better than me, plus they're always  stressing me out by passing the house chores to me. Lastly, when i attended to face-to-face classes, theres this teacher who made my social anxiety worsen. She reminds me of my mom but kinder. She raises her voice, and scolds us whenever we get the wrong answers. </p><p></p><p>Since this school year is almost over, I'm trying to overcome this problems at the moment. When i get bombarded, i adjust my schedule so that i could finish my tasks and pass it on time. Second, i overcame my family problems by opening up to them. Im glad they were in a good mood when i opened up, and I'm also happy because they understood what i was going through. And for the last problem, i did not back out on attending f2f classes, but i forced my self to be stronger and ignore those lectures of my teacher. It's also to lessen my social anxiety and improve my confidence. I understand why she does that, and it's because she wants us to be better at answering their questions. </p><p></p><p></p><br />
