                    <p>Books are a great source of wisdom. The words you found in the book are a living proof of knowledge left undiscovered. They come to life when you open a book and begin understanding what is written on the pages. When you read every word, you get to unlock their meaning. The meaning flows in you and when it reaches your brain, it is kept in every shelf of it. By the time you are going to use it, it will come to you naturally. Books will help you discover the amazing secrets covered by complexities of the world. Write a 3-sentence summary of what you understand from it.​</p>

                                            A long time ago, people have no idea about words and their meanings Dicson Nary, a migrant who loved traveling the world, saw a small group of people talking with each other. He wondered what they were talking about. His curiosity started then. He began listening to others' conversations, and day by day, new words were being added on his list. He was very patient searching for new words. He went to the different parts of the world looking for words that can be added on his word list. He continued searching for words. One day, he visited Merriam Webster, the most intelligent man in the world to ask for help. "I have listed words but how could this be used by the people easily?", asked by Dicson. The two great men arrived into the idea of listing words in a way the alphabet is ordered. Dicson never stopped looking for words. He didn't notice that the number of words on his list are becoming more and more. People used to visit his house for one reason. All of them asked the same question, "Dicson what is the meaning of this word?" Days went on, Dicson had become known in the world as a man of words. In honor of his great work and passion for words, the book that contains thousands of words and meanings was named after him. It was called dictionary. "For him, words were already part of human lives. You just have to discover its meaning by understanding how they were being used by us. All of us can make a dictionary. But not all can. Because patience had pushed me going forward to do my passion." 3.What made him curios about the meaning of words?​</a>

Diaz A long time ago. people have no idea about words and their meanings Dicson Nary, a migrant who loved traveling the world, saw a small group of people talking with each other. He wondered what they were talking about His curiosity started then. He began listening to others conversations, and day by day, new words were being added on his list. He was very patient searching for new words. He went to the different parts of the world looking for words that can be added on his word list. He continued searching for words. One day, he visited Merriam Webster, the most intelligent man in the world to ask for help. "I have listed words but how could this used by the people easily?". asked by Dicson. The two great men arrived into the idea of listing words in a way the alphabet is ordered. Dicson never stopped looking for words. He didn't notice that the number of words on his list are becoming more and more. People used to visit his house for one reason. All of them asked the same question, "Dicson what is the meaning of this word?" Days went on, Dicson had become known in the world as a man of words. o golead this bei In honor of his great work and passion for words, the book that contains thousands of words and meanings was named after him. It was called dictionary. "For him, words were already part of human lives. You just have to discover its meaning by understanding how they were being used by us. All of us can make a dictionary. But not all can. Because patience had pushed me going forward to do my passion."​</a>

                            5. A long time ago, people have no idea about words and their meanings Dicson Nary, a migrant who loved traveling the world, saw a small group of people talking with each other. He wondered what they were talking about. His curiosity started then. He began listening to others' conversations, and day by day, new words were being added on his list. He was very patient searching for new words. He went to the different parts of the world looking for words that can be added on his word list. He continued searching for words. One day, he visited Merriam Webster, the most intelligent man in the world to ask for help. "I have listed words but how could this be used by the people easily?", asked by Dicson. The two great men arrived into the idea of listing words in a way the alphabet is ordered. Dicson never stopped looking for words. He didn't notice that the number of words on his list are becoming more and more. People used to visit his house for one reason. All of them asked the same question, "Dicson what is the meaning of this word?" Days went on, Dicson had become known in the world as a man of words. In honor of his great work and passion for words, the book that contains thousands of words and meanings was named after him. It was called dictionary. "For him, words were already part of human lives. You just have to discover its meaning by understanding how they were being used by us. All of us can make a dictionary. But not all can. Because patience had pushed me going forward to do my passion." 3.What made him curios about the meaning of words?​</h2><br />

He wondered what they were talking about His curiosity started then. He began listening to others conversations, and day by day, new words were being added on his list. He was very patient searching for new words. He went to the different parts of the world looking for words that can be added on his word list. He continued searching for words. One day, he visited Merriam Webster, the most intelligent man in the world to ask for help. "I have listed words but how could this used by the people easily?". asked by Dicson. The two great men arrived into the idea of listing words in a way the alphabet is ordered. Dicson never stopped looking for words. He didn't notice that the number of words on his list are becoming more and more. People used to visit his house for one reason. All of them asked the same question, "Dicson what is the meaning of this word?" Days went on, Dicson had become known in the world as a man of words. o golead this bei In honor of his great work and passion for words, the book that contains thousands of words and meanings was named after him. It was called dictionary. "For him, words were already part of human lives. You just have to discover its meaning by understanding how they were being used by us. All of us can make a dictionary. But not all can. Because patience had pushed me going forward to do my passion."​</h2><br />
