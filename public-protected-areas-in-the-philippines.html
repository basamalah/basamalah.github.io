At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.

Aside from health risks, these front liners are also a mistreatment subject from violators. Thus, this study is conducted during the pandemic and gathered data through a phone interview. It is conducted to explore the lived experiences of Barangay Tanods and how they adjusted to the drastic change in the work environment, health risk exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. It also determines the specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they cope. Lastly, it aims to map out how these experiences and impacts will improve preparations and the development of policing strategies in future crises. Moreover, three major conclusions emerge from this study's findings:(1) Barangay tanods faced difficulties in the sudden shift of their work environment (2) Most of the barangay tanods received incentives from the government to supply their health and sanitary needs (3) Barangay tanods reflected on their experiences to further improve as public servants and to be prepared for future crisis.​</a>

Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I have never been away from my homeland, the Philippines First of all, the Philippines has a total land area of about 300 000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514 000 square kilometers. Latest census shows that Filipinos are now 100,000,000 in number. Thais, on the other hand, are now 67,000,000 2. Nestled among the granite peaks of eastern Hong Kong, a new man-made mountain is emerging. While plans to expand some sites are being proposed and a contro versial mega-incinerator project remains a possibility, focus in the city is turning to how to reduce the amount of waste it produces. The local government has created a task force to address the issue of food waste and has set a 10% reduction target by 2016. Globally, only around 3% of food waste is recycled. from "Hong Kong's Mounting Food Waste Problem" by Dean Irvine 3.A tiny nation in Southeast Asia, Singapore is one favorite destination for most travelers.

                                            Read the paragraph carefully. Then choose the correct answer on the following questions.
 Pasay City is considered the gateway to the Philippines by air. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport lies within its confines. Within its limited area of only 19 square kilometers live 386,702 residents. Squeezed into it are five colleges and universities, seven flying schools and public and private hospitals.
 Pasay has had a long and colorful history. In pre Spanish time, Rajah Soliman named it after his daughter, princess Pasay. A greater part of Pasay formed part of Nanayan, now St. Ana, a trading upstream along the Pasig River.
In 1727 Pasay was annexed to Malate to provide easier access to the Malate Parish. It was also at this time that Pasay was named Pineda, a Spanish landowner of the place who provided protection for the town people. At that time marauding brigands attacked and victimized many residents.
 Pasay has grown by accretion. On October 12, 1903, the Municipality of Malibay, earlier created on Feb. 2, 1889, was annexed to the Municipality of Pasay. Then ,on January 1,1942 Pasay was incorporated into greater Manila.
After the Second World War . In 1945 , Pasay reverted as a Municipality of Rizal province.
 On August 16,1947, it became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 183 and was renamed Rizal City. But three years later in 1950, it reverted to its former name Pasay City.
 Pasay City celebrated its 130th anniversary on December 2, 1993, as a pueblo or town, for it was on this day 130 years ago when civil and ecclesiastical 
authorities allowed the residents to manage their political and religious affairs. Now Pasay City contributes much of the country’s prosperity and progress.

At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.

Aside from health risks, these front liners are also a mistreatment subject from violators. Thus, this study is conducted during the pandemic and gathered data through a phone interview. It is conducted to explore the lived experiences of Barangay Tanods and how they adjusted to the drastic change in the work environment, health risk exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. It also determines the specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they cope. Lastly, it aims to map out how these experiences and impacts will improve preparations and the development of policing strategies in future crises. Moreover, three major conclusions emerge from this study's findings:(1) Barangay tanods faced difficulties in the sudden shift of their work environment (2) Most of the barangay tanods received incentives from the government to supply their health and sanitary needs (3) Barangay tanods reflected on their experiences to further improve as public servants and to be prepared for future crisis.​</a>

At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.

Aside from health risks, these front liners are also a mistreatment subject from violators. Thus, this study is conducted during the pandemic and gathered data through a phone interview. It is conducted to explore the lived experiences of Barangay Tanods and how they adjusted to the drastic change in the work environment, health risk exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. It also determines the specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they cope. Lastly, it aims to map out how these experiences and impacts will improve preparations and the development of policing strategies in future crises. Moreover, three major conclusions emerge from this study's findings:(1) Barangay tanods faced difficulties in the sudden shift of their work environment (2) Most of the barangay tanods received incentives from the government to supply their health and sanitary needs (3) Barangay tanods reflected on their experiences to further improve as public servants and to be prepared for future crisis.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This article, published in the Belitung Nursing Journal, presents a qualitative phenomenological study on the experiences of Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses working in COVID-19 intensive care units in Dubai, UAE. The study aimed to explore the challenges and experiences faced by these nurses during the pandemic. The study was conducted using a Husserlian phenomenological approach, and data was collected through in-depth interviews with eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals.</p><p></p><p>The study findings revealed four major themes: Challenges During the Pandemic, Patient Care during COVID-19, Adapting to Change, and Resilience Amidst the Pandemic. The challenges faced by the nurses included being away from home, caring for COVID-19 patients, and fear of the unknown. Patient care during COVID-19 involved caring for critically ill patients, and the nursing profession was identified as a subtheme. Adapting to change involved living in the new normal and protecting oneself from COVID-19. Finally, resilience amidst the pandemic involved being with others and seeing oneself.</p><p></p><p>The study concludes that despite the challenges faced by these OFW nurses, including cultural differences and homesickness, they were able to continue working and adapt to the changes brought about by the pandemic. The study suggests that further research is needed to explore the experiences of OFW nurses in other countries and to identify strategies to support their mental health and well-being during the pandemic.</p><p></p><p>Another qualitative study on the experiences of Barangay Tanods (community police officers) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines was also reviewed. This study explored how these front liners adjusted to the drastic change in their work environment, exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. The study aimed to determine specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they coped.

Nestled among the granite peaks of eastern Hong Kong, a new man-made mountain is emerging. While plans to expand some sites are being proposed and a contro versial mega-incinerator project remains a possibility, focus in the city is turning to how to reduce the amount of waste it produces. The local government has created a task force to address the issue of food waste and has set a 10% reduction target by 2016. Globally, only around 3% of food waste is recycled. from "Hong Kong's Mounting Food Waste Problem" by Dean Irvine 3.A tiny nation in Southeast Asia, Singapore is one favorite destination for most travelers. There are many reasons for this. One, Singapore is a "garden city with hundreds of parks and greenery dotted all over the country. Two, moving around the country is that easy, quick, and cheap. Singapore is known to have the best transit system in the world with ultramodern subway stations. Trains are driverless and roomy with protective glass walls. Aside from trains, there is a great bus and taxi service Another reason is that if one is a lover of culture, he or she can visit Singapore's historic locations and fascinating heritage centers. The country is nothing if not the "tapestry of Chinese, Indian, and Malay cultures associated with it. Shill another reason why travelers do not miss Singapore is the culinary adventure it offers.

In 1727 Pasay was annexed to Malate to provide easier access to the Malate Parish. It was also at this time that Pasay was named Pineda, a Spanish landowner of the place who provided protection for the town people. At that time marauding brigands attacked and victimized many residents.
 Pasay has grown by accretion. On October 12, 1903, the Municipality of Malibay, earlier created on Feb. 2, 1889, was annexed to the Municipality of Pasay. Then ,on January 1,1942 Pasay was incorporated into greater Manila.
After the Second World War . In 1945 , Pasay reverted as a Municipality of Rizal province.
 On August 16,1947, it became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 183 and was renamed Rizal City. But three years later in 1950, it reverted to its former name Pasay City.
 Pasay City celebrated its 130th anniversary on December 2, 1993, as a pueblo or town, for it was on this day 130 years ago when civil and ecclesiastical 
authorities allowed the residents to manage their political and religious affairs. Now Pasay City contributes much of the country’s prosperity and progress.

At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.

Aside from health risks, these front liners are also a mistreatment subject from violators. Thus, this study is conducted during the pandemic and gathered data through a phone interview. It is conducted to explore the lived experiences of Barangay Tanods and how they adjusted to the drastic change in the work environment, health risk exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. It also determines the specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they cope. Lastly, it aims to map out how these experiences and impacts will improve preparations and the development of policing strategies in future crises. Moreover, three major conclusions emerge from this study's findings:(1) Barangay tanods faced difficulties in the sudden shift of their work environment (2) Most of the barangay tanods received incentives from the government to supply their health and sanitary needs (3) Barangay tanods reflected on their experiences to further improve as public servants and to be prepared for future crisis.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In the study "Lived experiences of Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses working in COVID-19 intensive care units" published in the Belitung Nursing Journal, the researchers used a qualitative approach to explore the experiences of OFW nurses caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients in Dubai. Specifically, they used a Husserlian phenomenological approach, which seeks to describe and explore the essence of a phenomenon or experience as it is lived by the participants themselves. Through interviews with eight ICU nurses, the researchers aimed to generate a rich description of the challenges, patient care, adapting to change, and resilience experienced by OFW nurses during the pandemic. The qualitative approach allowed the researchers to gather in-depth data and generate themes and meanings from the nurses' own perspectives.</p><p></p><br />
