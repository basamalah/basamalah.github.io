                            2. brief summary of the story " my father goes to court " ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p><p></p><p>                This story was narrated by a four-year old kid whose family lived in a small town on Luzon. The farm of his father was destroyed by a Natural Calamity, which is flood. That is the reason why they preferred to live in a new place. They had a rich man neighbor, his children rarely go outside.  Their house so tall, where their family can watch the kid’s (narrator) house. The rich man’s servants were always cooking some delicious food, like fried chicken, ham, and bacon. The kid’s family inhaling the heavenly spirit of those foods.</p><p></p><p>                The narrator’s family always bond outside the Sun and bathing in the river. They always had a good time and a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watch them. As day past on, the rich man’s family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants always frying something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always close, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind.</p><p></p><p>                One morning, a police man knocked on the door of the narrator’s house. The rich man had a complaint to them, because they were accused by stealing the spirit of the wealth and food.</p><p></p><p>                When the trial came, the narrator’s family came first. After a few minutes, the rich man’s family came with a lawyer, their body was so thin and they look sick. The narrator’s father didn’t had any lawyer, he fight on his own. The trial starts, the lawyer questioned the narrator’s father. In the first question, the father didn’t agree that they stole the spirit of the wealth and the food. The father agreed in the second question, where he state that their family hung outside the rich man’s house and inhale the food. He also agreed that when the rich man’s family became sick, their family became strong and healthy.</p><p></p><p>                The rich man’s children went in shyly. They are really thin and look like sick. When it is time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who question him. The rich man agreed that while their family having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the narrator’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooking the food. The narrator’s father commit to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collect some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father is ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told to the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed.</p><p></p><p>                The judge told to the narrator’s father the story where his uncle died because of laughing. The judge like to hear narrator’s family laughing. The kid’s sisters started to laugh, and all of the people in the courtroom laughed and the judge’s laugh was the loudest of all.</p><p></p><p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p><p></p><p>                Honestly, it was really a great story. I also join to their laughter at the end. It was really came from our Philippine Literature. I understand it more than other stories. Let us talk about the story, what can you say about the rich man? The reason why they look sick and pale is because they didn’t enjoy their life, look, he seldom make the children go outside. The other family, even though they are poor, they had a good bonding.</p><p></p><p>                Carlos Bulosan was a really good author, not because he was a Filipino, but by his story. You can saw the Filipino skills to him, and Philippine Literature was really good.</p><p></p><p><strong>REFLECTION</strong></p><p></p><p>                This story really gives you many lessons. First, don’t be afraid to the case that had been accused to you if you don’t have secrets. Second, just tell the truth. Third, you may not need a lawyer if you can fight by your own by just HONESTY. Fourth, don’t accused someone because you are more powerful than them and you are jealous to them. Lastly, just enjoy your life.</p><p></p><p>                Accusing your fault to someone was really a bad thing to do, don’t ever do that. Here in Philippines, if you always laugh and laugh, it will makes your life even longer. I can relate some story in this one, rich family had everything but they don’t have the spirit of love in each other. In poor family they didn’t had thigs like the rich man but you can see the love in them.</p><p></p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Father Goes To Court by Carlos Bulusan.</strong></p><p></p><strong>Summary</strong><strong> </strong><p></p><p>          The story is set in a city in the Philippines. The farm of the narrator's father became a total wreckage due to the sudden Philippine flood which made him and his family live in town even though his father preferred to live in the country. They have a definitely rich man whose sons and daughters seldom come out of the house. Though they are poor, they are full of mischief and laughter. Playing in the sun and swimming in the river make them all strong and healthy.</p><p></p><p>          However, the rich children are shut inside their house and have no social life. While the poor family become fatter and healthier, they become thinner and sicklier although they are given plenty of good food, which its scent sent the neighbors enjoying smelling over the fence. Because of this, the rich man shuts the windows tightly and accuses the narrator’s family that they are stealing the spirit of his family’s food. Then the case goes to court.</p><p></p><p>          While in the court, the rich man's lawyer and the poor father cross-examine their cases. The father does not agree that he and his family steal the heavenly spirit of the food, but he admits that they inhaled it. He says that he will pay back the rich neighbor. He does this by collecting coins from his family. Then he shakes the hat full of coins. Being charged to pay for the spirit of food which his family supposedly got from its smell, he maintains that the jingling of the coins is a fair equivalent. The judge rules the poor father’s favor, and the rich man is forced to depart with no other payment than the “spirit” of the money the he collected. </p><p></p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong></p><br />
