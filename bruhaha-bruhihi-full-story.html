                        Once , there was a boy who has a talent in playing the lyre. He was the son of one of the muses, Calliope. His name is Orpheus. He plays the lyre so well that every time he plays, veryone gathers around him. He later married a maiden named, Eurydice. But not long after, Eurydice died because she accidentally stepped on a nest of vipers. Orpheus was very sad that all he plays was sad melodies and music. But because he can't bear to live without Eurydice, he decided to get her back from the Underworld. He started traveling to the Underworld. Charon, the ferryman in the river of styx, helped him across the river because his music was so beautiful he cannot say no to Orpheus. Even the three-headed beast, Cerberus, who guards the Underworld was tamed by Orpheus and quietly let him pass. Orpheus reached the rulers of the Underworld; which are Hades and Persephone. Even the cold and affectless Persephone was moved by Orpheus' music. And the stern King of the Underworld began to weep, he couldn't say no to Orpheus. He let Orpheus have his wife back, IN ONE CONDITION. In order to have her back successfully, he should not look back at her unless they've completely left the Underworld. So Orpheus, with Eurydice behind him, traveled back to Earth. They can almost see the daylight ahead before leaving the cave but suddenly, Orpheus thought Eurydice was gone behind him, so he looked back to check on her. But he forgot what Hades said to him. So Eurydice was pulled back again to the Underworld. No matter how much he begged, the gods never allowed him again to get his wife back. So Orpheus always played sad music until the rest of his life grieving for his wife's loss. <br />

Ursa Major is better known to residents of the United States as the Big Dipper. The Big Dipper is simply a pattern (or asterism) found within the constellation of Ursa Major. According to legend, Ursa Major was once the beautiful maiden Callisto, whom the god Zeus had an affair with. In order to protect her and their son, Arcas, from his jealous wife Hera, Zeus turned Callisto and Arcas into bears. He then picked up the bears by their short, stubby tails and threw them into the sky. While doing this the tails of the bears stretched out. Arcas can be seen in the night sky as the constellation of Ursa Minor. The constellation of Ursa Major is visible all year round for observers in the Northern Hemipshere. The constellation never sets below the horizon, although it does become very low in the sky during the winter months. Ursa Major can easily be spotted in the northern sky.<p></p><p>According to legend, Ursa Major was once the beautiful maiden Callisto, whom the god Zeus had an affair with.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>As</strong><strong>caffeine is addictive, my guess is that they do it to get you hooked. Coke used to contain just that: coke, or cocaine. When the harmful effects of cocaine were discovered they had to keep that "pep" in the soda. The Coca-Cola company switched to caffeine as the primary stimulant in their cola. Since then, it's been tradition to add caffeine to </strong><strong>cola.</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Louise Mallard has heart trouble, so she must be informed carefully about her husband’s death. Her sister, Josephine, tells her the news. Louise’s husband’s friend, Richards, learned about a railroad disaster when he was in the newspaper office and saw Louise’s husband, Brently, on the list of those killed. Louise begins sobbing when Josephine tells her of Brently’s death and goes upstairs to be alone in her room.</p><p></p><p>Louise sits down and looks out an open window. She sees trees, smells approaching rain, and hears a peddler yelling out what he’s selling. She hears someone singing as well as the sounds of sparrows, and there are fluffy white clouds in the sky. She is young, with lines around her eyes. Still crying, she gazes into the distance. She feels apprehensive and tries to suppress the building emotions within her, but can’t. She begins repeating the word Free! to herself over and over again. Her heart beats quickly, and she feels very warm.</p><p></p><p>Louise knows she’ll cry again when she sees Brently’s corpse. His hands were tender, and he always looked at her lovingly. But then she imagines the years ahead, which belong only to her now, and spreads her arms out joyfully with anticipation. She will be free, on her own without anyone to oppress her. She thinks that all women and men oppress one another even if they do it out of kindness. Louise knows that she often felt love for Brently but tells herself that none of that matters anymore. She feels ecstatic with her newfound sense of independence.</p><p></p><p>Josephine comes to her door, begging Louise to come out, warning her that she’ll get sick if she doesn’t. Louise tells her to go away. She fantasizes about all the days and years ahead and hopes that she lives a long life. Then she opens the door, and she and Josephine start walking down the stairs, where Richards is waiting.</p><p></p><p>The front door unexpectedly opens, and Brently comes in. He hadn’t been in the train accident or even aware that one had happened. Josephine screams, and Richards tries unsuccessfully to block Louise from seeing him. Doctors arrive and pronounce that Louise died of a heart attack brought on by happiness.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Note:</p><p>This is only the summary of the story, I'm sorry that I cannot input the Full story because when I send the Full story earlier, it said it was incorrect.</p><p></p><p>But this is the link of the Full story:</p><p>https://archive.vcu.edu/english/engweb/webtexts/hour/</p><p></p><p></p><p>This is the link for the summary:</p><p>https://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/the-story-of-an-hour/summary/</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are many stories about lazy girls, but one popular version is the folktale called "The Lazy Girl." The story goes like this:</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a girl who was so lazy that she never wanted to do anything. She would sleep all day, and when it was time to do chores, she would make excuses and try to get out of doing them. Her mother was very frustrated with her and tried to get her to be more productive, but the girl would not listen.</p><p></p><p>One day, the girl's mother gave her a spindle and some flax and told her to spin it into thread. The lazy girl groaned and complained but eventually sat down to start the task. However, as soon as she started spinning, she quickly became bored and fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>While she was sleeping, a little man appeared and finished spinning the flax into thread for her. When the lazy girl woke up and saw the thread, she was amazed and thought that she had done it all herself. Her mother praised her for her hard work, and the lazy girl was very pleased with herself.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the girl's mother gave her even more flax to spin into thread. The lazy girl again fell asleep while spinning, and the little man appeared once again to finish the task for her. This continued for several days, with the girl getting more and more flax each day, and the little man always coming to help her when she fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>One day, the lazy girl's mother decided to follow her daughter to see what she was doing with all the flax. She saw the little man helping her daughter and was very surprised. The next day, when the lazy girl fell asleep, the mother stayed awake and waited for the little man to appear.</p><p></p><p>When he did, she asked him why he was helping her daughter. The little man explained that he was a good spirit who wanted to help people, but that the lazy girl was taking advantage of him. He told the mother to wake her daughter up and make her do the work herself.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the lazy girl's mother woke her up when she fell asleep while spinning. The girl was surprised to see that she had not finished the task, but her mother explained everything to her. From that day on, the lazy girl learned the value of hard work and stopped being so lazy.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest po ty!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang Kansilay ay isang maliit na baryo sa hilagang bahagi ng Cebu. Ito ay isang tahimik at mapayapang lugar na tinitirahan ng mga taong nagtatanim ng mga prutas at gulay. Sa baryo ng Kansilay ay mayroong isang mag-asawa na nagngangalang Juan at Maria. Sila ay mayroong anak na lalaki na si Pepito.</p><p></p><p>Si Pepito ay isang masayahing bata na mahilig maglaro ng mga laro sa labas kasama ang kanyang mga kaibigan. Isa sa kanyang mga paboritong laro ay ang paghahabol sa mga alitaptap sa gabi. Tuwing gabi, pumupunta siya sa bukid upang hanapin ang mga alitaptap at sumasabay din siya sa kanyang mga kaibigan.</p><p></p><p>Isang gabi, habang naghahabol si Pepito ng mga alitaptap, napadaan siya sa isang puno ng Kansilay. Nakita ni Pepito na mayroong mga bunga ang puno at naisipan niyang subukan ito. Nang kinagat niya ang bunga, napansin niya na ito ay napakasariwa at masarap. Naisip niya na ibahagi ito sa kanyang mga kaibigan kaya't kinuha niya ang mga bunga at dinala sa bahay.</p><p></p><p>Nang ipakain ni Pepito ang mga bunga sa kanyang mga kaibigan, lahat sila ay napa-wow sa sarap ng bunga ng Kansilay. Dahil dito, naisipan ni Pepito na magtanim ng Kansilay sa bukid nila. Sinabi niya ito sa kanyang mga magulang at pumayag naman sila.</p><p></p><p>Kinuha ni Pepito ang mga buto ng Kansilay at itinanim sa bukid nila. Sa loob ng ilang buwan, lumaki ang mga halaman at nagsimula na rin itong magbunga. Dahil sa tagumpay ni Pepito, naging sikat ang baryo ng Kansilay at naging pinagkakakitaan ng mga taga-baryo ang Kansilay.</p><p></p><p>Mula noon, ginamit na rin ang Kansilay sa pagluto ng mga masasarap na pagkain tulad ng mga ulam at panghimagas. Dahil sa tagumpay ni Pepito, napagkitaan ng mga tao sa Kansilay at naging masaya ang kanilang pamumuhay. Ito ang naging simula ng tagumpay ng baryo ng Kansilay.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A Good Story </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Woyengi is the female deity of the Ijo people of Nigeria; the creation story tells of her standing on the edge of the universe and creating human dolls that were neither male nor female. The dolls were asked to choose whether they wanted to be male or female, the blessings they wished to receive, and their preferred occupation. Once the dolls were sent down a specific stream, there was no turning back, and Woyengi became known as the goddess of destiny. Two women, one who chose to give birth to many children and the other who chose to wield magic power over the world, grew up as sisters and fulfilled their destiny. However, the woman given magic power, Ogboinba, became discouraged with her choice and journeyed back to the earth to see if she could choose again and be reborn as someone else. Ultimately, she was denied and retreated into the eyes of pregnant women, where she remains today.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        I don't remember now how we got onto the subject, but one day Teacher said that the palms of the black's hands were much lighter than the rest of their bodies because only a few centuries ago they walked around on all fours, like wild animals, so their palms weren't exposed to the sun, which made the rest of their bodies darker and darker. I thought of this when Father Christiano told us after catechism that we were absolutely hopeless, and that even the blacks were better than us, and he went back to this thing about their hands being lighter, and said it was like that because they always went about with their hands folded together, praying in secret. I thought this was so funny, this thing of the black's hands being lighter, that you should just see me now — I don't let go of anyone, whoever they are, until they tell me why they think that the palms of the black's hands are lighter. Dona Dores, for instance, told me that God made their hands lighter like that so they wouldn't dirty food they made for their masters, or anything else they were ordered to do that had to be kept quite clean.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Religion and philosophy are two distinct concepts that deal with different aspects of human experience and understanding.</p><p></p><p>Religion is a set of beliefs, practices, and rituals centered on the worship of a higher power or deity. It often involves a set of moral principles and codes of conduct that guide the behavior of believers. Religion often involves the belief in a supernatural power or powers that are responsible for the creation and operation of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Philosophy, on the other hand, is the study of fundamental questions about reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, and the nature of the mind and consciousness. It is a broad field of inquiry that encompasses a wide range of topics, including ethics, metaphysics, politics, and aesthetics. Philosophy is often concerned with understanding the nature of reality and how we can know things about it, as well as exploring the fundamental nature of human experience and understanding.</p><p></p><p>One way in which religion and philosophy differ is that religion often involves a set of beliefs that are based on faith and are accepted without question, while philosophy is centered on the use of reason and critical thinking to explore and understand the world. Another difference is that religion is often practiced within a community of believers, while philosophy is typically pursued as an individual pursuit of understanding.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also some similarities between religion and philosophy. Both can involve the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, and both can be motivated by a desire to find meaning and purpose in life. Both religion and philosophy can also involve a set of ethical principles that guide behavior and decision-making.</p><br />

                            28. the aged mother full story</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy.</p><p>Shining was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confues, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged.”</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain’s many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. Hew rapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell.</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son.” She said. “The mountain road is full of dangers. LOOK carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther down”. The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “oh, Honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!”</p><p></p><p>Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.</p><p></p><p>The entire province trembled with dread. The order must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother. “Wait!” she said. “I will think.
