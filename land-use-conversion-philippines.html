Directions: Analyze the document below and write conversations in the comic strips template below that would capture the perspectives (speech) of Claro M. Recto. Selected paragraphs from the Speech delivered by Minister of Foreign Affairs Claro M. Recto, on the Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, over Station PIAM, Manila, December 9, 1943: Two years ago yesterday we were witnesses in the Philippines to the first violent explosions presaging the birth of a New Order in East Asia. In all frankness it must be admitted that, on that fateful day and for some time thereafter, we looked upon the bewildering developments of the war with dread and suspicion. There was no time to consider the larger issues of the struggle, to train the cool light of analysis upon the tangled thread of motive and aspiration. At the moment, we Filipinos knew only that it was our duty to rise in defense of our native land. Because of this faith and conviction, thousands upon thousands of our young men went forth to battle to give proof of their manhood and patriotism to all the world. Bataan will be long remembered for this reason, and for this alone: that in the jungles of that battle-tom peninsula, in the face of bullet, shell and bomb, of disease, starvation and despair, the young manhood of this nation made a stand for what it sincerely believed to be a just and righteous cause and held its ground to the bitter end, without counting the cost. More than a week ago, on National Heroes Day, we paid homage to the memory of these gallant heroes of the Fatherland. Today, as we observe the second anniversary of the war that provided the occasion of their supreme sacrifice, it is fitting to recall that they, too, in their single- minded and soldierly fashion, were builders of an independent Philippines, contributors to the greatness of Asia, and upholders of the honor of all Asians. How has this transformation of values come about? With characteristic gallantry the Japanese people have encouraged us to take pride in the heroic sacrifices of our men who died on the battlefields of this war, to honor and venerate them, not as if they were merely misguided or ill- advised individuals, but as exponents of the highest aspirations of our people and as the embodiment of the noblest qualities of our race.​</a>

Select one of these main problems and state why this is happening in ourenvironment. (10 pts.)2. Explain how can you contribute to help this situation become better. (10 points)​</h2><br />
                        <p>1.) One of the serious problems affecting biodiversity is the conversion of forestlands to other uses (like turning it to residential lands or farm lands). Both residential and farm lands are beneficial, especially to our economy, but taking away the forests and replacing it for those purposes can cause detrimental effects to our environment. </p><p></p><p>2.) I can contribute to help this situation become better by being respectful of other species' habitat. Small efforts like properly disposing waste, especially when in forests, can be a big help. I can also contribute to the betterment of this situation by making infographics about the negative effects of the issue (conversion of forestlands). I can upload it on social media and do short blogs to raise people's awareness regarding the topic.</p><p></p><p>Ayan. Sana nakatulong!</p><br />

                            10. Activity 3: "Komiks-O!" Directions: Analyze the document below and write conversations in the comic strips template below that would capture the perspectives (speech) of Claro M. Recto. Selected paragraphs from the Speech delivered by Minister of Foreign Affairs Claro M. Recto, on the Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, over Station PIAM, Manila, December 9, 1943: Two years ago yesterday we were witnesses in the Philippines to the first violent explosions presaging the birth of a New Order in East Asia. In all frankness it must be admitted that, on that fateful day and for some time thereafter, we looked upon the bewildering developments of the war with dread and suspicion. There was no time to consider the larger issues of the struggle, to train the cool light of analysis upon the tangled thread of motive and aspiration. At the moment, we Filipinos knew only that it was our duty to rise in defense of our native land. Because of this faith and conviction, thousands upon thousands of our young men went forth to battle to give proof of their manhood and patriotism to all the world. Bataan will be long remembered for this reason, and for this alone: that in the jungles of that battle-tom peninsula, in the face of bullet, shell and bomb, of disease, starvation and despair, the young manhood of this nation made a stand for what it sincerely believed to be a just and righteous cause and held its ground to the bitter end, without counting the cost. More than a week ago, on National Heroes Day, we paid homage to the memory of these gallant heroes of the Fatherland. Today, as we observe the second anniversary of the war that provided the occasion of their supreme sacrifice, it is fitting to recall that they, too, in their single- minded and soldierly fashion, were builders of an independent Philippines, contributors to the greatness of Asia, and upholders of the honor of all Asians. How has this transformation of values come about? With characteristic gallantry the Japanese people have encouraged us to take pride in the heroic sacrifices of our men who died on the battlefields of this war, to honor and venerate them, not as if they were merely misguided or ill- advised individuals, but as exponents of the highest aspirations of our people and as the embodiment of the noblest qualities of our race.​</h2><br />
