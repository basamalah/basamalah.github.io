                                            GENERAL INSTRUCTION: Read and analyze the statement carefully and answer the following questions. Filipino-American rapper EZ Mil, who has gone viral for his performance of the song Panalo, apologized for the historical inaccuracy in his work, where he said that Lapu-Lapu was beheaded in Cebu. In his interview, he said, "Why I chose the term, pinugutan si Lapu sa Mactan.' Because in terms of the rhyming pattern, I always go to this dilemma or doubt in my head in closing out a song. Am I gonna close it out with absolute truth or am I gonna make people talk about it? It's like me weighing off the options. That's me putting an exaggerated term in a ploy to drive traffic and talk. It's inaccurate but he still died. He's dead right now. It's not overall factual in a way but still like... the thing that is factual is that whenever he did die, people were still saddened," He added, “That's why the song is what it is right now. The way I wrote that got people talking. Got people agreeing to it. Got people disagreeing, got people in the in-betweens. The way it is now, people are talking about it. I got to be smart about it." As a result, LAPU-LAPU CITY, Cebu - Mayor Junard Chan on Monday said he will ask the city council here to declare Fil-Am music artist Ez Mil as “persona non grata” over lyrics about the Cebuano hero Lapu lapu in his now-viral “Panalo” song. Question: 1. Read the story of how Lapu-Lapu died. Discuss it briefly and concisely.2. What is Persona non Grata? Discuss it briefly and concisely. 3. What is your opinion about EZ Mi song “Panalo” despite the issue?​</a>

In a life's like this, I need to resist. The two of us, are meant to be enemies. Enemies like Loki and M. There's no place for romance, I can't have this fondness. What is this sorcery? Your dazzling smile, the one I always seek. Everytime you turn, everything clicks. You can't leave my head, like a score in a test. Your actions said you love me, But I can't love you, I need to crush you. Like a hot weather does to a sundae. This feeling feeling so down, I wonder If I can win. In a glimpse Everything sinked I've fallen deep with my emulate I'm overdue you're already in the blue While I'm still here waiting for you Wasn't able to bring out the desires of my heart That everything is requite That I was only for thee If paths crossed once more in the right hour I can finally inform That you're the one I adorecan explain this plssss kung ano Po yung emotions niya or ano ring yung thoughts nung writer.

The Climb
There's always gonna be another
mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the c
There's always gonna be another
mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the climb
Jesus, Take the Wheel
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm
on

                            7. GENERAL INSTRUCTION: Read and analyze the statement carefully and answer the following questions. Filipino-American rapper EZ Mil, who has gone viral for his performance of the song Panalo, apologized for the historical inaccuracy in his work, where he said that Lapu-Lapu was beheaded in Cebu. In his interview, he said, "Why I chose the term, pinugutan si Lapu sa Mactan.' Because in terms of the rhyming pattern, I always go to this dilemma or doubt in my head in closing out a song. Am I gonna close it out with absolute truth or am I gonna make people talk about it? It's like me weighing off the options. That's me putting an exaggerated term in a ploy to drive traffic and talk. It's inaccurate but he still died. He's dead right now. It's not overall factual in a way but still like... the thing that is factual is that whenever he did die, people were still saddened," He added, “That's why the song is what it is right now. The way I wrote that got people talking. Got people agreeing to it. Got people disagreeing, got people in the in-betweens. The way it is now, people are talking about it. I got to be smart about it." As a result, LAPU-LAPU CITY, Cebu - Mayor Junard Chan on Monday said he will ask the city council here to declare Fil-Am music artist Ez Mil as “persona non grata” over lyrics about the Cebuano hero Lapu lapu in his now-viral “Panalo” song. Question: 1. Read the story of how Lapu-Lapu died. Discuss it briefly and concisely.2. What is Persona non Grata? Discuss it briefly and concisely. 3. What is your opinion about EZ Mi song “Panalo” despite the issue?​</h2><br />

To test the limits and breakthrough
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free</h2><br />

The Climb
There's always gonna be another

Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other
side
It's the climb
Jesus, Take the Wheel
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands

I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm
on
Jesus, take the wheel</h2><br />
