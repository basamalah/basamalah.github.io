Social Sciences are interrelated and interconnected disciplines that study man's social aspect. There are a handful of Social Science disciplines, and the way to distinguish them from each other is to look at their different (1) or focus of study. In this lesson, we looked into the (2) disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology They are "sisters" in a sense because their interests in choosing a subject of study are almost similar, but their interpretations vary: Anthropology focuses on the (3) side, while Sociology focuses on the side: Anthropology studies humans in general, and Sociology studies human interactions. This lesson also defined culture and social structures. Culture was defined using 16) classic definition; it is everything man-made that is used to adapt, and interact with the physical and social environment of man (ex: clothing, rituals, celebrations, symbols, language, etc.). On the other hand, Social structures or 17 are patterns of our social interactions. Family, friends, religion, economy, and mass media are some examples of structures or patterns of our interactions​</h2><br />
