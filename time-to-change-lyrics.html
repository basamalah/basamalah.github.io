Our National Anthem 
 Our national anthem was first publicly played on June 12, 1898 as the Filipino flag was being raised during the proclamation of the Philippine Independence by Gen. Aguinaldo. When it was composed by Julian Felipe, there were no words yet to the hymn. 
 On September 3, 1899, Jose Palma's lyrics in Spanish was first published and it was instantly accepted as fitting lyrics to the hymn. In 1916, English was declared the official language in government offices and schools; so the Spanish lyrics had to be changed to English. A literal translation was made by Martha Lane, an American schoolteacher who collaborated with Camilo Osias. This became for a time the official version of our national anthem. 
 After the proclamation of Independence in 1946, it became a necessary to have a version in Filipino. Finally, in 1956, a stirring lyric in Filipino was approved and won public acceptance. The Filipino National Anthem has remained unchanged since then.</a>

It was composed by Julian Felipe and there were no words yet to the hymnOn September 3, 1899. Jose Palma's Lyric in Spanish was first published and itwas instantly accepted as fitting lyrics to the hymn.In 1916, English was declared the official language in government offices andschools, so the Spanish lyric had to be changed to English. A literal translation was madeby Martha Lane, an American school teacher who collaborated with Camilo Osias. Thisbecame for a time the official version of our national anthem.After the independence proclamation in 1946, it became necessary to have aversion in Filipino. Finally, in 1956 a stirring lyric in Filipino was approved and won publicacceptance. The Filipino National Anthem has remained unchanged since then.1.

like this cause it is for a survey who are here likes the song
here is the lyrics of it:
Secure the bag, know what I'm sayin'?
Banrisk on the beat
Ayo, Perish, this sh- hot, boy
People change like the tides in the ocean
At least I think or am I dead wrong?
Foot on the brake, at the light I don't notice
I sit and wait until the next song
20 hours in an old van
Up the east coast, through the cold wind
Drove 20 hours by the ocean
Up the east coast, what a road trip
Now that interstate is paved with memories
Of a past life I lived when I was 18
And evеry winter, I think back to what we used to bе
In that past life we lived at 18
Uh, I reminisce about a past life
Things change, I get it, 'cause nothing lasts right?
Yeah, and I was thinking 'bout her last night
Scrolling through our memories, debating 'bout our last times
Ay, for a minute, we was cool
Then we flew just a lil' too close to the sun
Now we finished, now we through
Guess we knew one day we would have to grow up
20 hours in an old Ford
Across the Midwest, thinking, what for?
Drove 20 hours, but it's hopeless
Across the Midwest, what a road trip
Now that interstate is paved with memories
Of a past life I lived when I was 18
And every winter, I think back to what we used to be
In that past life we lived at 18</a>

When mice are kept at high population densities, their behavior changes in anumber of ways. Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases.Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity. Communalnesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusualcommunal living.

Alternative rock features a steady bass drum laying downthe beat, with easy flowing guitar riffs over the top. The bass line is toned town, and thelyrics are sung with intensity an authority. Depending on the song, the guitars can either beacoustic guitars or electric guitars. Classic rock combines a steady driving bass drum sound,with high snare overtones, steady and often repeating guitar riffs, and an intensive bass line.The guitars are more often than not all electric guitars, and distortion is rarely used. Thelyrics are sung with style and enthusiasm. Hard rock, or metal, features a hard rolling bassdrum with an abundant amount of cymbal work. This style of rock uses several electricguitars with heavy distortion to bring a very intense sound. A hard, intense, driving bass linerounds out the style.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Romanticism (also known as the Romantic era) was an artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850.</p><p>2. True </p><p>3. When he was four years old, William Blake had a vision of "the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty!" Later, expressed in his poetry and visual art, his prophetic visions and belief in the "real and eternal world" of the imagination resulted in the unknown artist being acknowledged as the " ...</p><p>4.Chromatic harmony was used more frequently than in earlier periods. Composers added more notes to their chords to form extended chords. Composers used dissonance to make their music more expressive. Music was modulated to more distant keys than those used by composers in the Classical period.</p><p>5. A symphonic poem or tone poem is a piece of orchestral music, usually in a single continuous movement, which illustrates or evokes the content of a poem, short story, novel, painting, landscape, or other (non-musical) source.</p><p>6. lieder</p><p>Because so many art songs in a Romantic style were composed by German composers, we often use the German word for songs, “lieder,” when studying this genre.</p><p>7. a virtuoso was, originally, a highly accomplished musician, but by the nineteenth century the term had become restricted to performers, both vocal and instrumental, whose technical accomplishments were so pronounced as to dazzle the public.</p><p>8. Another form of music is, the art song, a vocal composition that gives premium on symbolic meanings attached on the lyrics -and focusing of virtuoso- and lastly, the popularization of gifted performers who can sing or play instruments like the piano and the violin.</p><p>9. How did music change during the Romantic period?</p><p>Tone color became richer; harmony became more intricate. Dynamics, pitch, and tempo had wider ranges, and the use of rubato became popular.

Our National Anthem 
 Our national anthem was first publicly played on June 12, 1898 as the Filipino flag was being raised during the proclamation of the Philippine Independence by Gen. Aguinaldo. When it was composed by Julian Felipe, there were no words yet to the hymn. 
 On September 3, 1899, Jose Palma's lyrics in Spanish was first published and it was instantly accepted as fitting lyrics to the hymn. In 1916, English was declared the official language in government offices and schools; so the Spanish lyrics had to be changed to English. A literal translation was made by Martha Lane, an American schoolteacher who collaborated with Camilo Osias. This became for a time the official version of our national anthem. 
 After the proclamation of Independence in 1946, it became a necessary to have a version in Filipino. Finally, in 1956, a stirring lyric in Filipino was approved and won public acceptance. The Filipino National Anthem has remained unchanged since then.</h2><br />

Secure the bag, know what I'm sayin'?
Banrisk on the beat
Ayo, Perish, this sh- hot, boy
People change like the tides in the ocean
At least I think or am I dead wrong?
Foot on the brake, at the light I don't notice
I sit and wait until the next song
20 hours in an old van
Up the east coast, through the cold wind
Drove 20 hours by the ocean
Up the east coast, what a road trip
Now that interstate is paved with memories
Of a past life I lived when I was 18
And evеry winter, I think back to what we used to bе
In that past life we lived at 18
Uh, I reminisce about a past life
Things change, I get it, 'cause nothing lasts right?
Yeah, and I was thinking 'bout her last night
Scrolling through our memories, debating 'bout our last times
Ay, for a minute, we was cool
Then we flew just a lil' too close to the sun
Now we finished, now we through
Guess we knew one day we would have to grow up
20 hours in an old Ford
Across the Midwest, thinking, what for?
Drove 20 hours, but it's hopeless
Across the Midwest, what a road trip
Now that interstate is paved with memories
Of a past life I lived when I was 18
And every winter, I think back to what we used to be
In that past life we lived at 18</h2><br />
