                                            Research Work: Below is an excerpt of an article entitled "In the Philippines, it's more fun to be a senator" from Philippine Daily Inquirer last January 10, 2013. It involves millions of pesos in the hands of the Senators. "Imagine a yearly pork barrel of 200 million pesos (US$4.9 million), 2.2 million pesos monthly for staff salaries and office expenses, a 500,000 pesos annual travel allowance and an honorarium that ranges between 30,000 to 60,000 pesos a0 month as chair of a Senate committee. And don't forget the regular monthly salary of 75,000 pesos". (Senator Miriam) Santiago's revelations (about the "savings" or "secret funds" available to the Senate President, House Speaker, and other heads of offices) followed Enrile's supposedly selective release of a total of 1.618 million pesos in two tranches as additional "maintenance and other operating expenditures" (MOOE) to each of her 18 colleagues from "savings" of the chamber in 2012. Four other senators Enrile wasn't exactly fond of-Santiago included-got 250,000 pesos each. What can you say about this issue? Do you think members of Congress deserve this much money? Why or Why not?​</a>

                            20. Research Work: Below is an excerpt of an article entitled "In the Philippines, it's more fun to be a senator" from Philippine Daily Inquirer last January 10, 2013. It involves millions of pesos in the hands of the Senators. "Imagine a yearly pork barrel of 200 million pesos (US$4.9 million), 2.2 million pesos monthly for staff salaries and office expenses, a 500,000 pesos annual travel allowance and an honorarium that ranges between 30,000 to 60,000 pesos a0 month as chair of a Senate committee. And don't forget the regular monthly salary of 75,000 pesos". (Senator Miriam) Santiago's revelations (about the "savings" or "secret funds" available to the Senate President, House Speaker, and other heads of offices) followed Enrile's supposedly selective release of a total of 1.618 million pesos in two tranches as additional "maintenance and other operating expenditures" (MOOE) to each of her 18 colleagues from "savings" of the chamber in 2012. Four other senators Enrile wasn't exactly fond of-Santiago included-got 250,000 pesos each. What can you say about this issue? Do you think members of Congress deserve this much money?
