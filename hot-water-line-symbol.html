                        <p>{ ANSWER } </p><strong>Water closet is just another name for a typical gravity flush toilet. If you want to get detailed, “water closet” can also be used to describe a small room that houses a toilet. A water closet can be great to add a little privacy to a larger bathroom or shared mater bath.</strong><strong>Ceiling vents allow air to pass through the attic and out through vents in the roof. When the cooler kicks on, the ceiling vent is automatically opened by the barometric damper responding to the air pressure change. When the cooler turns off, damper closes</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>The vent stack is the pipe leading to the main roof vent. It channels the exhaust gases to the vent and helps maintain proper atmospheric pressure in the waste system.</strong><strong>The cold water service line slopes away from the water heater after splitting from the main line. Instead of sending water through the heater, cold water service lines run directly to every water appliance in the home.</strong><strong>With thorough researches and observations, PEX stands to be the best choice for hot water systems within your domestic environment; its ability to preserve energy and resist detrimental effects from hot water and its added benefits of being cheap and easy to install makes it a strong candidate when considering pipes to</strong><strong>.</strong><p></p><p>sana makatulong.</p><br />
