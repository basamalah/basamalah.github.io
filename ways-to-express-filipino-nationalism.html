                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

                                            Philippines is a semifeudal nation. Big business landlords and elites exploit the natural resources and the cheap serf-like labor of the country. This results in the displacement of families who then migrate to urban areas or to other countries to find a better living. It makes me wonder why the Canadian government only allows one family member to come to Canada if they need more people here. The Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) is a program of the federal government allowing Canadians to import temporary migrant live-in caregivers, known around the world as domestic workers. If they complete the program, they can become Canadian citizens and sponsor their family through the reunification program. This takes an average of seven years, sometimes more. That’s a long time to be separated from your family. A long time spent taking care of the children of others, while your own need you at home. This aspect of the program causes damage to family relationships, one that affects the children deeply—this I can tell you from personal experience. Canadians need to be aware that we are part of this system. Not only here in Canada through our immigration policies, but also in the Philippines where Canadian imperialism contributes to forcedmigration. Part of our taxes goes to fund Canadian companies in the Philippines (especially in the mining sector), and Canadian military training of the Philippine armed forces to help protect those companies and forcefully displace Filipinos from the countryside through militarization. I want a Philippines with true democracy and true independence. I want justice for the marginalized and underrepresented. Today I am the Chairperson of Anakbayan-Toronto. We advocate for human rights, and we struggle for national industrialization that will keep Filipino families intact and ensure that no one will have to leave the country for a better life. I don’t want any child to suffer what I went through. Anakbayan-Toronto will not stop calling for national industrialization and genuine land reform in the Philippines, this is the only way that Filipinos will be able to work decent jobs, and not have to leave the country.1.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

                                            Pliant Like a Bamboo
IV Mallari 
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which the stronger of the two was, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
 The wind blew it hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of it. But finally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down.
 The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protests, but it let the winds have their way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
 Filipinos are like bamboos. They know that they are not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces, so they yield. They bend their heads gracefully with many loud protests.
 They have survived. The Spaniards came and dominated them for more than three hundred years. When the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood-only much richer in experience and culture.
 The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos who embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniards' vague promise of the hereafter.
 Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence rude, relentless and cruel. The Filipinos learned to bow their heads low to "cooperate" with the Japanese in their "holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere." The Filipinos had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but they learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their "benevolence and magnanimity."
 Now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
 For the Filipinos will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer them; that is why they are contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not theirs. To them, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision, but today, well-lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow, a vision of hope. In like manner, the Filipino regards vicissitudes of fortune as the bamboo tree regards the angry blasts of the blustering wind.
 The Filipinos are eminently suited to their romantic role. They are slender and wiry. They are nimble and graceful in their movements. Their voices are soft and have the gift of languages. In what other place in the world can you find people who can carry on a fluent conversation in at least three languages?
 This gift is another means by which the Filipinos have managed to survive. There is no insurmountable barrier between them and any of the people who have come to live with them - Spanish, Americans, Japanese. The foreigners do not have to learn their language. They easily manage to master theirs.
 Verily, the Filipinos are like the bamboo tree. In their grace and ability to adjust to the peculiar and inexplicable whims of fate, the bamboo tree is their expressive and symbolic national tree. It will have to be, not the molave nor the narra, but the bamboo.

                            1. In what way were Filipinos able to express political nationalism during the anti-dictatorship movement and the opposition to the military bases’ agreement?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Filipino nationalism refers to the establishment and support of a political identity associated with the modern nation-state of the Philippines, leading to a wide-ranging campaign for political, social, and economic freedom in the Philippines. This gradually emerged from various political and armed movements throughout most of the Spanish East Indies—but which has long been fragmented and inconsistent with contemporary definitions of such nationalism—as a consequence of more than three centuries of Spanish rule. These movements are characterized by the upsurge of anti-colonialist sentiments and ideals which peaked in the late 19th century led mostly by the ilustrado or landed, educated elites, whether peninsulares, insulares, or native (Indio). This served as the backbone of the first nationalist revolution in Asia, the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>have a nice day</p><br />

                            2. Can you translate this to Filipino? A hero symbolizes goodness. Jose Rizal became the National hero because he fought from freedom in a silent but powerful way. He expressed his love for the Philippines through his novels, essays, articles and poems rather than a force of aggression.</h2><br />
                        Ang isang bayani ay modelo ng kabutihan. Si Jose Rizal ay naging Pambansang Bayani ng Pilipinas dahil nakipaglaban siya sa pamamagitan ng tahimik pero makapangyarihang paraan para sa kalayaan.

                            7. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />

                            8. Philippines is a semifeudal nation. Big business landlords and elites exploit the natural resources and the cheap serf-like labor of the country. This results in the displacement of families who then migrate to urban areas or to other countries to find a better living. It makes me wonder why the Canadian government only allows one family member to come to Canada if they need more people here. The Live-in Caregiver Program (LCP) is a program of the federal government allowing Canadians to import temporary migrant live-in caregivers, known around the world as domestic workers. If they complete the program, they can become Canadian citizens and sponsor their family through the reunification program. This takes an average of seven years, sometimes more. That’s a long time to be separated from your family. A long time spent taking care of the children of others, while your own need you at home. This aspect of the program causes damage to family relationships, one that affects the children deeply—this I can tell you from personal experience. Canadians need to be aware that we are part of this system. Not only here in Canada through our immigration policies, but also in the Philippines where Canadian imperialism contributes to forcedmigration. Part of our taxes goes to fund Canadian companies in the Philippines (especially in the mining sector), and Canadian military training of the Philippine armed forces to help protect those companies and forcefully displace Filipinos from the countryside through militarization. I want a Philippines with true democracy and true independence. I want justice for the marginalized and underrepresented. Today I am the Chairperson of Anakbayan-Toronto. We advocate for human rights, and we struggle for national industrialization that will keep Filipino families intact and ensure that no one will have to leave the country for a better life. I don’t want any child to suffer what I went through. Anakbayan-Toronto will not stop calling for national industrialization and genuine land reform in the Philippines, this is the only way that Filipinos will be able to work decent jobs, and not have to leave the country.1.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

                            22. Pliant Like a Bamboo
IV Mallari 
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which the stronger of the two was, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
 The wind blew it hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of it. But finally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down.
 The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protests, but it let the winds have their way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
 Filipinos are like bamboos. They know that they are not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces, so they yield. They bend their heads gracefully with many loud protests.
 They have survived. The Spaniards came and dominated them for more than three hundred years. When the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood-only much richer in experience and culture.
 The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos who embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniards' vague promise of the hereafter.
 Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence rude, relentless and cruel. The Filipinos learned to bow their heads low to "cooperate" with the Japanese in their "holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere." The Filipinos had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but they learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their "benevolence and magnanimity."
 Now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
 For the Filipinos will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer them; that is why they are contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not theirs. To them, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision, but today, well-lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow, a vision of hope. In like manner, the Filipino regards vicissitudes of fortune as the bamboo tree regards the angry blasts of the blustering wind.
 The Filipinos are eminently suited to their romantic role. They are slender and wiry. They are nimble and graceful in their movements. Their voices are soft and have the gift of languages. In what other place in the world can you find people who can carry on a fluent conversation in at least three languages?
 This gift is another means by which the Filipinos have managed to survive. There is no insurmountable barrier between them and any of the people who have come to live with them - Spanish, Americans, Japanese. The foreigners do not have to learn their language. They easily manage to master theirs.
 Verily, the Filipinos are like the bamboo tree. In their grace and ability to adjust to the peculiar and inexplicable whims of fate, the bamboo tree is their expressive and symbolic national tree. It will have to be, not the molave nor the narra, but the bamboo.

                            26. Pliant Like the Bamboo By Ismael V. MallariThere is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was strongest of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.The winds blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. Butfinally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down.The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protests, but it let the winds have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.The Filipino is like the bamboo. He knows that he is not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protests.And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means ofwinning over the Filipinos who embraced the American way of life more readily than theSpaniards’ vague promise of the hereafter.Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plaque of locusts, like a pestilencerude, relentless and cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity.”And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese,those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.For the Filipino will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer him. That is why,he is contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other peoples of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the pastis already a dream and tomorrowin only avision but today, well-lived makes everyyesterday a dream of happiness andevery tomorrow, a vision of hope. In likemanner, the Filipino regards vicissitudesof fortune as the bamboo tree regardsthe angry blasts of the blustering wind.The Filipino is eminently suitedto his romantic role. He is slender andwiry. He is nimble and graceful in hismovements. His voice is soft, and hehas the gift of languages. In what otherplace in the world can you find peoplewho can carry on a fluent conversationin at least three languages?This gift is another means by whichthe Filipino has managed to survive. Thereis no insurmountable barrier between himand any of the people who have come tolive with him — Spanish, Americans,Japanese. The foreigners do not have tolearn his language. He easily manages tomaster theirs.Verily, the Filipino is like the bambootree. In its grace, in its ability to adjust itselfto the peculiar and inexplicable whims to fate,the bamboo tree is his expressive and symbolicnational tree. It will have to be, not the molavenor the narra, but the bamboo.PA answer thank you ​</h2><br />
