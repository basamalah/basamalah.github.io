The Brain, Heart, Lungs, Liver, Kidneys, Stomach, Small and Largeintestines, Bones and Muscles.&gt; The Brain is the control center of the nervous system. There are billions ofnerve cells in the brain. It receives information from all parts of the body. Signalsfrom the Brain direct body activities. Messages to and from the Brain travelalong nerve cells or neurons. It also controls the body automatic functions likecontraction of the cardiac muscles, respiration, digestion and circulation and allbody's voluntary muscles. The three [3] main parts of the Brain are theCerebrum, Cerebellum and the Brain stem (medulla oblongata, pons]. Each parthas particular functions.The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is divided into four 41section or lobes. Areas for specific sensory, motor and mental activities aredistributed within the lobesLOBES1. Frontal2. Temporal3.Parietal4.OccipitalCONCERNFor speech and movementFor hearing and smellFor taste and touchFor sightThe cerebellum is concerned with the maintenance of posture and balance,and the coordination of movements.The Brain stem has three parts, the medulla, pons and midbrain. Themedulla controls the involuntary activities such as breathing and heart rate.​</a>
