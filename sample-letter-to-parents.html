                                            Activity 1 "PEA-ce of cake" OBJECTIVE: 1. Identify the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of offspring in the standard monohybrid DIRECTION: Solve the monohybrid cross following the step-by-step procedure: Sample Problem Word Problem 1. Read the problem carefully. Given that tall stem length (T) is dominant Given that round seed (R) is dominant over over dwarf stem length (t). wrinkled seed (r). A garden pee plant with heterozygous gene A garden pea plant with homozygous gene pair for tall is crossed with a garden pea pair for round seed is crossed with a garden plant with homozygous gene pair for tall, is pea plant with heterozygous gene pair for there a possibility that a dwarf garden pea round seed. Is there a possibility that a plant is produced from the cross? garden pea plant with wrinkled seed is produced from the cross? 2. Identify the parents from the problem then write the GENOTYPE of the parents. Remember: For a particular character, an individual contains a PAIR. Genotype can be a HOMOZYGOUS (wherein the pair is BOTH small or BOTH big) or HETEROZYGOUS (the pair contains one big and one small letter) PARENT 1: Garden pea plant with PARENT 1: heterozygous gene pair for tall (GENOTYPE: Tt) (GENOTYPE: PARENT 2: Garden pea plant with PARENT 2: homozygous gene pair for tall (GENOTYPE: TT) (GENOTYPE: (Since it is homozygous used BOTH CAPITAL letter since it was stated that " homozygous gene pair for tal" and tall is dominant and have the symbol ) 3. Nou, according to the "PRINCIPLE OF SEGREGATION" during gametes formation, the pair separate. Simply, put the separated pair of the parents to the TOP of the first and second column and SIDE of the first and second rows of the Pannett square. Combine the gametes from the top and side for each box inside the Punnett square. PARENT 1: T t (top) PARENT 2: TT (side) I T 1 4. Identify the phenotype for each box If the genotype is homozygous follows the symbol for each trait. But if the pair is heterozygous, follow the "PRINCIPLE OF DOMINANCE which states that for a heterozygous gene pair the dominant trait will mask the recessive trait. pls help​</a>

Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance. I am sure this is the correct career path as I grew up in a family where my father was a city councilor and my mother was a social worker. Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career. I have attached my transcript of records, application essay, letters of recommendation and other pertinent documents. Thank you for your time. and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, MEGAN REYES Answer the following questions based on the sample collegeadmission letter.1. What is the school's complete name?  2. Why did Megan Reyes choose Silliman University?3. What's her purpose for applying? 4. What other documents are sent together with her letter?​</a>

Read the problem carefully. Given that tall stem length (T) is dominant Given that round seed (R) is dominant over over dwarf stem length (t). wrinkled seed (r). A garden pee plant with heterozygous gene A garden pea plant with homozygous gene pair for tall is crossed with a garden pea pair for round seed is crossed with a garden plant with homozygous gene pair for tall, is pea plant with heterozygous gene pair for there a possibility that a dwarf garden pea round seed. Is there a possibility that a plant is produced from the cross? garden pea plant with wrinkled seed is produced from the cross? 2. Identify the parents from the problem then write the GENOTYPE of the parents. Remember: For a particular character, an individual contains a PAIR. Genotype can be a HOMOZYGOUS (wherein the pair is BOTH small or BOTH big) or HETEROZYGOUS (the pair contains one big and one small letter) PARENT 1: Garden pea plant with PARENT 1: heterozygous gene pair for tall (GENOTYPE: Tt) (GENOTYPE: PARENT 2: Garden pea plant with PARENT 2: homozygous gene pair for tall (GENOTYPE: TT) (GENOTYPE: (Since it is homozygous used BOTH CAPITAL letter since it was stated that " homozygous gene pair for tal" and tall is dominant and have the symbol ) 3. Nou, according to the "PRINCIPLE OF SEGREGATION" during gametes formation, the pair separate. Simply, put the separated pair of the parents to the TOP of the first and second column and SIDE of the first and second rows of the Pannett square. Combine the gametes from the top and side for each box inside the Punnett square. PARENT 1: T t (top) PARENT 2: TT (side) I T 1 4. Identify the phenotype for each box If the genotype is homozygous follows the symbol for each trait. But if the pair is heterozygous, follow the "PRINCIPLE OF DOMINANCE which states that for a heterozygous gene pair the dominant trait will mask the recessive trait. pls help​</h2><br />

Currently, I am just beginning my journey and I am ready to take the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish Bachelor in Public Affaits (BPA) at Silliman University. Once I have completed my undergraduate course, I intend to pursue further studies in the same field, so I can be fully equipped for public service and governance.

Both of my parents are graduates of Silliman University and I have seen how dedicated they have been to serving people. My goal therefore is to become a passionate public servant like my parents, and I believe that Silliman University School of Public Affairs can adequately prepare me for my chosen career.
