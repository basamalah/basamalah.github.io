                                            Plastics and Environmental Pollution As more and more plants are used, more plastic waste is generated. This waste contributes a lot to environmental pollution because plastics do not break down easily. Methods of minimizing the problem have been proposed. One of these methods is recycling. Usually, big industries recycle by cleaning and separating the plastics by type. Then they remelt and reform the thermoplastics into new products by either grinding them into fine powder or shredding them. The powder is used as filler. The shreds can be used as insulation in quilted jackets and sleeping bags. In households, plastic items can be separated from other waste materials. The plastic materials can then be donated or sold to plastic manufacturers. Another proposal is to use only plastics that are biodegradable those that break down through the action of microorganisms. Some plastics photo degradable. This means that they break down through long exposure to sunlight. Today, there are trash bags, foam cups, and other biodegradable plastics. But environmental groups look at these products with distrust. They argue that even under the best conditions, plastic products leave plastic residue behind and these will not break down at all when buried in landfills. They also feel that the chemicals added to make plastics biodegradable also make the plastics until for recycling. For good or bad, the use of plastics has brought humankind to a turning point. Answer the following points: 1. Why does plastic waste contribute a lot to environmental pollution? 2. How can the problem of plastic pollution be minimized? 3. As a grade six pupil, which of the proposals mentioned will you be able to take some action why? 4. If you were asked about the total ban on the use of plastic materials,what is your stand? ​IV.

Answer this activity on a paper Waler shorlage is becoming a serious problem in the clly because of the growing population That is why the clly government has to take concrete steps to address it. One solution is to make more water available through recycling. The building of more desalination plants may be done but it is very expensive. Another solution that the city officials are doing now is educating the people so they do not waste water. Meanwhile, there is also a move of the government to protect existing water supplies from being polluted. There are some more ideas to help solve the problem, but maybe the ultimale solution is that everyone must become actively involved Main Idea Supporting Dela Supporting Detail Supporting Detail V.

                        <p>The importance of recycling and some common learnings, feelings, and difficulties associated with the experience.</p><p></p><p>a. Recycling materials can be an important learning experience as it teaches us the value of sustainability and environmental responsibility. Through recycling, we can reduce waste and conserve resources, which can have a positive impact on the environment and future generations. One important learning from recycling is the importance of sorting and separating different materials, such as plastics, paper, and metals, to maximize their reuse and minimize their impact on the environment.</p><p></p><p>b. Recycling can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience as it allows us to take an active role in protecting the environment and promoting sustainability. By recycling, we can feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in knowing that we are doing our part to make a positive difference in the world. However, the experience can also be challenging, especially if we are not used to separating and sorting materials, or if we are not familiar with local recycling regulations and procedures.</p><p></p><p>c. Some common difficulties associated with recycling include a lack of knowledge about what materials can be recycled, confusion about local recycling regulations and procedures, and limited access to recycling facilities or programs. These difficulties can be sregularlyearch, seeking guidance from local recycling authorities, and practicing good recycling habits regularly. Additionally, it is important to stay motivated and committed to the process of recycling, even when it may seem inconvenient or challenging. By staying focused on the benefits of recycling and the positive impact it can have on the environment, we can overcome these difficulties and make recycling a regular part of our daily lives.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Solid Waste Management and
</p><p>Recycling Technology of Japan
</p><p>－ Toward a Sustainable Society Toward a Sustainable S</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>With the aim of preserving the environment in rapidly developing
</p><p>nations, we will introduce Japanese waste management and
</p><p>recycling technologies, which effectively turn waste into resources
</p><p>or appropriately dispose of it.
</p><p></p><p> Due to economic development, industrialization and increasing
</p><p>population, problems related to the expanded consumption and depletion
</p><p>of resources, and the increased output of wide-ranging types of waste are
</p><p>becoming more serious than ever.
</p><p> There is a word in Japan: Mottainai. It encompasses the practice of
</p><p>treasuring and using all things as long as possible. While economies
</p><p>continue to grow, this spirit of Mottainai restrained the generation
</p><p>of waste and motivated the development of technology for reuse,
</p><p>recycling and effective use through heat recovery.
</p><p> As Japan's landmass is limited and finding landfill disposal sites is
</p><p>difficult, we have developed a system to collect and transport waste,
</p><p>process it through intermediary treatment by incineration and other
</p><p>methods, and then dispose it in landfills in a sanitary manner, in
</p><p>order to prevent environmental pollution in the areas surrounding
</p><p>densely populated cities.
</p><p> This booklet introduces some of leading Japanese waste disposal
</p><p>and recycling technologies.
</p><p> We hope to create a material-recycle society that generates as little
</p><p>waste as possible and recycles and reuses wastes as resources, and
</p><p>hope that the most advanced technologies and systems based on our
</p><p>experience and achievement may assist to preserve the environment
</p><p>and recycle resources on a global level.

                            14. Plastics and Environmental Pollution As more and more plants are used, more plastic waste is generated. This waste contributes a lot to environmental pollution because plastics do not break down easily. Methods of minimizing the problem have been proposed. One of these methods is recycling. Usually, big industries recycle by cleaning and separating the plastics by type. Then they remelt and reform the thermoplastics into new products by either grinding them into fine powder or shredding them. The powder is used as filler. The shreds can be used as insulation in quilted jackets and sleeping bags. In households, plastic items can be separated from other waste materials. The plastic materials can then be donated or sold to plastic manufacturers. Another proposal is to use only plastics that are biodegradable those that break down through the action of microorganisms. Some plastics photo degradable. This means that they break down through long exposure to sunlight. Today, there are trash bags, foam cups, and other biodegradable plastics. But environmental groups look at these products with distrust. They argue that even under the best conditions, plastic products leave plastic residue behind and these will not break down at all when buried in landfills. They also feel that the chemicals added to make plastics biodegradable also make the plastics until for recycling. For good or bad, the use of plastics has brought humankind to a turning point. Answer the following points: 1. Why does plastic waste contribute a lot to environmental pollution? 2. How can the problem of plastic pollution be minimized? 3. As a grade six pupil, which of the proposals mentioned will you be able to take some action why? 4. If you were asked about the total ban on the use of plastic materials,what is your stand? ​IV.

One solution is to make more water available through recycling. The building of more desalination plants may be done but it is very expensive. Another solution that the city officials are doing now is educating the people so they do not waste water.
