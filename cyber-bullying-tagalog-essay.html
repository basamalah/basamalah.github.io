                                     Cyber-bullying has been a problem for a very long time. Due to the development of our technology today, cyber-bullying has become one of the most difficult issues to resolve in our society. Since cyber-bullying issues are more likely to happen at schools, social networking, and mobile phones; Teachers, principals, and parents are responsible to monitor, prevent, and punish cyber-bullying. The expectations of most parents of the school, is protection. Meanwhile, many staff feel unprepared and unwilling to be prosecutors and judges because they do not want to be sued for something done which might seem right to them but not to others, especially to parents who are responsible for the child's well being.<br />             Students and teachers should always have conversations about relationships on a daily basis. Although teachers can't preach kindness to students; but they can teach students how to be nice and kind to one another. Teachers needs to structure learning activities in which children can learn to view individual differences as unique sources of strength. For example, a lawsuit was filed against a high school about bullying in upstate New York; a gay teenager sued the Mohawk Central School District, saying school officials had not protected him. "The district said it would increase staff training to prevent harassment" (Eckholm and Katie 3). It is very important that every student, not just the few that sign up for special projects or after school activities, but students who are involved in any various activities in school should attend meetings about teaching students how to respect each other. This will help teachers prevent cyber-bullying in school by drawing students together. People have to understand that some children bully because they have emotional and developmental problems, or because they come from abusive families. <br />

                        Cyber bullying has been a problem for a very long-time.Due to the development of our technology today,cyber-bullying has become one of the most difficult issues  to resolve on our society.Since cyber-bulling issues are more likely happento schools,social networking,and mobile phones;Teachers,principals,and parents are responsible to monitor ,prevent,and punish cyber-bullying.Meanwhile many staff feel unprepared and unwilling to be prosecutors and judges because they do not want to be used by something done which might seem right to them but not to others,especially to parents ho are responsible for the child''s well being.Student and Teachers should always have conversation about daily basis.Although teachers can't preach kindness to students;but they can teach students how to kind to one another .Teachers needs to structure learning activities in which children can learn to view individual differences as unique source of streght.For example,a lawsuit was filled against a high school about bullying in upstate New York; a gay teenager used the Mohawk Central School District,saying school officials had not protect him.The district said it would increase staff training to prevent harrasment.It is very important that every student,not just the few that sign up for special projects or after school activities,but students ho are involved in any various activities in school should attend meetings about teaching students ho to respect each other.This will help teachers prevent cyber-bullying in school by drawing students together.People have to understand that some children bully because they have emotional and developmental problems because they come from abusive families.Teachers have to understand that this is only because students require their help.<br />

                        <p>Sakin SA ka kabang biktima ng bullying noong nag-aaral ka pa? O baka ang is among mahal sa buhay ngayon ay nakaranas ng pambu-bully habang nasa eskwela?
</p><p>
</p><p>Isinusulong ngayon sa kongreso ang panukalang batas na nag lalayong magpatupad ng polisya laban sa pambu-bully sa mga paaralan, kolehiyo at unibersidad sa bansa.
</p><p>
</p><p>Maraming nag papakita ng pagiging maton at gusting manakot sa loob ng silid-aralan. Sa totoo lang, marami ng kasong ganito pero hindi lamang nagsasalita ang biktima o nam-bully. Maaring ayaw ng iparating sa kanyang mga magulang at baka ipatawag lamang sa school at magkaroon pa ng gulo. Mayroon namang mga biktima ng bullying na natatakot magsumbong sapagkat baka resbakan siya ng kaklaseng maton. Kaya minabuting manahimik na lamang at hayaang i-bully ng kaklase.
</p><p>
</p><p>Pero hindi ng maganda an nangyayari sa ginagawang pambu-bully sa mga paaralan (ma-pribado man at ma-publiko). Paano’y nassangkot na ang mga magulang at kaibigan sa gulo. Mayroong iginaganti na lamang ang na-bully. Katwiran ay para patas na lng sila.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ang mga paaralan ang may responsibilidad sa nangyayaring ito. Dapat nalalaman ng pamunuan ng school kung may nangyayaring bullying sa kanilnag compung. Dpat tinatanong nila isa-isa ang mga estudyante ukol ditto, Guidance counsellor ang dapat magsasagawa ng pag-iimbestiga o pag-usisa. Hindi n adapt lumaki ang gulo o umabot sa karahasan ang kaso ng pambu-bully.</p><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying is a recent form of aggression that students use to humiliate and attack their less popular peers. Like traditional bullying, this behavior is based on the imbalance of power between bullies and victims and may continue for a long time. Cyberbullying manifests itself in posting and sharing abusive comments, photos, and videos, writing intimidating e-mails and messages, spreading rumors, etc. (Völlink, Dehue, &amp; Guckin, 2015). Unlike face-to-face school bullying, this type of aggression may occur at any time and in any place, so the victim cannot escape it. It is also more difficult to prevent bullying and punish abusers because they often remain anonymous. Cyberbullying has a detrimental effect on victims’ emotional and psychological health, so effective solutions to this phenomenon should be introduced to protect children.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Bullying is an aggressive behavior that is hurtful and often cause embarrassment and intimidates the person being bullied. This can happen to anyone. The people being bullied often feels powerless and alone. Bullying isn’t just punching someone in the face or someone calling horrible names. Bullying is a lot more than that. Bullying isn’t new to the society, it existed long ago but thanks to the development of technology people especially teenagers are now being bullied at home. Cyberbullying is a serious problem that can leave the victims feeling helpless and overwhelmed. This has become one of the most difficult issues to resolve in our society today.</p><p></p><p><strong>If</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you </strong><strong>feel</strong><strong> </strong><strong>like</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>lacks </strong><strong>words</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong>graphs</strong><strong> </strong><strong>which</strong><strong> </strong><strong>is</strong><strong> </strong><strong>obvious</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Feel free </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> </strong><strong>add</strong><strong> </strong><strong>some</strong><strong> </strong><strong>more</strong><strong> </strong><strong>or</strong><strong> </strong><strong>just</strong><strong> </strong><strong>them</strong><strong> </strong><strong>so</strong><strong> </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> </strong><strong>could</strong><strong> </strong><strong>create</strong><strong> </strong><strong>para</strong><strong>graphs</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Good</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Luck</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><br />

It involves using the Internet, social media, or other electronic communication platforms to harass, threaten, or intimidate others. Cyberbullying can take many forms, including sending threatening or cruel messages, posting embarrassing pictures or videos, or spreading rumors or lies about someone online. It can also involve excluding someone from online social groups or engaging in other forms of online social aggression.</p><p></p><p>The consequences of cyberbullying can be severe. It can lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem in those who are targeted. It can also cause problems with schoolwork and relationships, and in extreme cases, it can even lead to suicide.</p><p></p><p>There are several factors that can contribute to cyberbullying. One is the anonymity that the Internet provides. It is easier for someone to harass or threaten others online when they can do so without revealing their identity. The lack of face-to-face contact can also make it easier for people to be more aggressive or mean online because they do not have to see the immediate consequences of their actions.</p><p></p><p>Another factor that can contribute to cyberbullying is the prevalence of smartphones and other devices that allow people to access the Internet and social media at all times. This constant connectivity can make it more difficult for people to escape from cyberbullying, as it can occur at any time and in any place.</p><p></p><p>There are several steps that individuals can take to protect themselves from cyberbullying. One is to be cautious about what personal information they share online. This includes not sharing their full name, address, phone number, or other sensitive information. It is also a good idea to use privacy settings on social media accounts to control who can see their posts and personal information.</p><p></p><p>Another step that individuals can take is to think carefully before posting anything online. It is important to consider how their words and actions might affect others and to treat others with respect. It is also a good idea to be aware of the "digital footprint" that they are leaving behind and to be mindful of what they post online.</p><p></p><p>There are also steps that parents and schools can take to help prevent cyberbullying. Parents can educate their children about the risks of cyberbullying and the importance of being kind and respectful online. They can also monitor their children's online activities and talk to them about how to handle cyberbullying if it occurs. Schools can also educate students about cyberbullying and the importance of being kind and respectful online. They can also implement policies to address cyberbullying and provide resources to help students who are being bullied.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cyberbullying is a serious problem that affects people of all ages, but it is particularly prevalent among young people. It involves using the Internet, social media, or other electronic communication platforms to harass, threaten, or intimidate others. The consequences of cyberbullying can be severe and can include feelings of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. There are steps that individuals, parents, and schools can take to help prevent cyberbullying, including being cautious about what personal information is shared online, thinking carefully before posting anything online, and educating others about the risks and consequences of cyberbullying.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cyber bullying is a serious problem in today's digital world, and it is a form of harassment that can have long-lasting effects on the victim. As more and more people spend their time online, cyber bullying has become a pervasive issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. In this essay, I will argue that cyber bullying is a harmful and destructive behavior that must be stopped.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, cyber bullying can have serious psychological effects on the victim. It can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Many victims of cyber bullying also experience social isolation and difficulty forming relationships, which can have a lasting impact on their well-being.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, cyber bullying can lead to physical harm. In some cases, victims of cyber bullying have been driven to self-harm or suicide. This is a tragic outcome that is entirely preventable if we take action to stop cyber bullying.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, cyber bullying can have a negative impact on academic performance. Students who are bullied may struggle to focus on their studies, leading to poor grades and lower academic achievement.</p><p></p><p>In order to combat cyber bullying, we must take a multifaceted approach. Parents, teachers, and other adults must be vigilant in monitoring the online activity of young people and take action if they suspect cyber bullying is occurring. Social media companies must also take responsibility for monitoring their platforms and responding quickly to reports of cyber bullying. We can also promote awareness and education about the impact of cyber bullying through public awareness campaigns and school programs.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, cyber bullying is a destructive behavior that can have serious long-term consequences. It is up to all of us to take action to prevent and stop cyber bullying in our communities. By working together, we can create a safer and more positive digital world for all.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>low bat na ako huhhhuhh</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. Essay about cause and effect about cyber bullying</h2><br />
                        <strong></strong>Most people know that bullying is wrong. Calling someone names has absolutely no beneficial purpose. Moreover, hitting someone makes a bully feel good in the moment while doing permanent damage to the person being victimized. With the Internet, people now have even more opportunities to bully through cyberbullying. This includes sending crude pictures, posting fake web pages, or tweeting slanderous messages. Cyberbullying has subsequently led to a rise in a completely new kind of bullying.<p>One of the effects of bullying is that it can change the victim’s personality. It can cause people who are normally confident and happy to become self-conscious, shy, and unsure. Additionally, victims of bullying may also become sad or depressed. Their confidence might completely disappear, keeping them from trying new things or trusting people. Once a person has been bullied, they may hesitate to participate in situations where he or she might be ridiculed, such as in public speaking or in sports. A bullying victim might even begin to possess previously absent anxious<br />behavior.</p><p>Despite all the negative effects of bullying, there are even far more serious consequences. People who have been bullied sometimes become so upset, scared, or depressed that they see no worth in themselves and no way out of their torment. There have been countless reports over the past few years of students committing suicide because they were bullied. Meanwhile, there are times when victims see no recourse but to seek revenge by serious acts of violence against the bully and instigators. As a result of bullying, people can lose their ability to love and trust, denying them the chance to experience a quality relationship later in their life. They might find themselves as a submissive partner or they may want to be completely alone. Compounding all of these problems, victims often develop eating disorders, begin to self-injure, or require extensive counseling. Social bullying can also leave people without a supportive group of friends that they can lean on and spend time with.</p><p>Another unfortunate consequence of this is that bullying is often cyclical. People who have been bullied can, in an attempt to gain their power and self-esteem back, become bullies themselves. In relation to this, bullies who are not confronted or stopped may find themselves in future positions where they can bully as adults. This is where manipulative bosses and child abusers come from.</p><p>Aside from its long-term effects, some consequences of bullying can be seen and felt immediately. When one child calls another child names, the victim might cry and a bruise might appear after a punch to the arm. However, some effects of bullying are not always obvious to the naked eye. The results of bullying might grow and appear over time, damaging a person in profound ways for the long term. There are so many effects of bullying that they are impossible to count or predict. This is why it is so important to stop bullying.</p><br />

                        <p>Typed this one for ya 'lad </p><p></p><p></p><p>   Cyberbullying is a form of harassment that occurs online or through electronic devices such as smartphones, computers, and tablets. This type of bullying can have a profound negative impact on the lives of young people, and it is important to take steps to control it to prevent any further harm. While some may argue that cyberbullying is simply a part of modern life and that children should just toughen up, it is essential to acknowledge the severity of the issue and work to prevent it from happening in the first place.</p><p></p><p>   One of the most significant concerns about cyberbullying is the impact it has on young people's mental health. Constant harassment and humiliation can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Cyberbullying can also lead to physical harm, including self-harm and suicide. The rise in cyberbullying-related incidents over the years is a clear indication that this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p></p><p>   Some may argue that cyberbullying is just a part of growing up, and children need to learn to deal with it. However, this is not a valid argument. Bullying of any kind should never be accepted, and we should work to prevent it from happening altogether. Children should not be subjected to the pain and suffering that comes with cyberbullying, and it is our responsibility to protect them.</p><p></p><p>   The issue of cyberbullying can also have a ripple effect on the community. Children who are bullied may become bullies themselves, perpetuating the cycle of harassment and humiliation. This can create a negative environment, where children are afraid to speak out and seek help.</p><p></p><p>   One way to prevent cyberbullying is to regulate online behavior. Parents, teachers, and other adults should monitor online activity and take action when necessary. Schools and organizations should also provide education on the dangers of cyberbullying and how to prevent it. We must create a culture where bullying of any kind is unacceptable, and there are severe consequences for those who engage in it.</p><p></p><p>   In conclusion, cyberbullying is a serious issue that needs to be controlled to prevent a negative influence on youth. The impact of cyberbullying can be devastating, and it is our responsibility to protect our children from harm. While some may argue that cyberbullying is just a part of modern life, we must work to prevent it from happening and create a safe and positive environment for our youth. By taking action and regulating online behavior, we can make a difference and create a better future for our children.</p><br />
