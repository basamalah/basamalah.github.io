                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Drawing on arguments found in international relations theory, this chapter explores Philippine nationalist resistance against imperial occupation in the late nineteenth century leading up to the Philippine–American War at the turn of the twentieth century. In particular, the chapter explores the transnational diffusion of liberal ideas among Philippine revolutionaries developed during the period of Spanish colonial rule. In hopes of securing their independence after the Spanish–American War, Filipino leaders quickly developed a constitution based on republican ideals, a legislative body, and a declaration of independence and national self-determination. Paradoxically, such ideas and actions remained unpersuasive to American policymakers. With the Treaty of Paris formally ending the war with Spain in 1898, the United States acquired its first overseas empire. In response, Filipinos resorted to guerilla warfare, drawing the United States into its “first Vietnam.”</p><br />

                            4.  Nonfiction is a genre of writing that deals with real-life people, places or events. To be nonfiction, all of the text must be true. Use the back of this page to list some nonfiction writing that you know about. It can be anything, from a magazine you get each month, to the newspaper, to the textbooks you use for school. Even TV shows can count as nonfiction literature! Now, use the examples below and write why you would read each of the following Example: Philippine History textbook A report for school 1. A biography about Datu Lapu-Lapu 2. Cookbook 3. Daily Newspaper 4. Books on marine animals 5. Chart on annual rainfall​</h2><br />
                        <strong>A biography about Datu Lapu-Lapu</strong><p>Knowing about Lapu Lapu's life is important since he has become an essential and inspiring part of the history of the islands which became known as the Philippines and their resistence to foreign takeover by European countries such as Spain.Rather, it's the noteworthy qualities about him that can be gleaned: his leadership, courage, tactical prowess, and his principles. The Battle of Mactan can be easily seen as having been designed by Lapulapu the way he'd like to unfold it. Through psy-war, he was able to steer Magellan into attacking during low tide.</p>Cookbook<p>Reading your cookbooks helps you understand everything from the organization of a menu to the relationships between flavors.Let us just face the facts, we are addicted to cookbooks. Our favorite books teach us how to cook, how to have healthy cooking and also entertain by letting us glimpse a piece of our favorite chefs.</p>Daily Newspaper<p>Newspapers carry the news of the world. Newspapers provide information and general knowledge. Newspapers provide news about a country's economic situation, sports, games, entertainment, trade and commerce. Reading newspaper makes a good habit and it is already part of the modern life.</p>Books on marine animals<p>Marine ethology: The behavior of marine animals is studied so that we understand the animals that share the planet with us. This is also an important field for help in understanding how to protect endangered species, or how to help species whose habitats are threatened by man or natural phenomena.</p>Chart on annual rainfall​<p>Rainfall is one of the climatological data which is widely analyzed for a long time. Analysis of rainfall data is important as it facilitates policy decisions regarding the cropping pattern, sowing date, construction of roads and providing drinking water to urban and rural areas.</p><p></p><strong>#Let'sStudy</strong><strong>#CarryOnLearning</strong><strong></strong><strong>PA BRAINLIEST THANKS</strong><br />

*5 points each  (top down and bottom up)</h2><br />
                        <p>L. Reading Materials and Purpose</p><p>1. "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald - to explore the</p><p>themes of love, wealth, and the American Dream in the 1920s.</p><p>2 "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey-</p><p>to leam about personal and professional development</p><p>strategies and improve productivity.</p><p>3. "1984" by George Orwell - to gain insights into totalitarianism,</p><p>surveillance, and censorship in a dystopian society.</p><p>4. "Becoming" by Michelle Obama - to understand the life and</p><p>experiences of Michelle Obama and gain inspiration and</p><p>motivation for personal growth.</p><p>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari</p><p>- to gain a broad overview of human history and evolution</p><p>and understand the key factors that shaped the world we live</p><p>in today.</p><p>I. Models of Reading:</p><p>1. Bottom-up Model - emphasizes the importance of decoding</p><p>individual words and phrases to build an understanding of a text,</p><p>starting from the smallest linguistic units and building up to</p><p>larger meanings.</p><p>2. Top-down Model - focuses on the reader's prior knowledge,</p><p>experiences, and expectations as a starting point for</p><p>understanding a text, with meaning derived from context and</p><p>personal interpretation.</p><p>3. Interactive Model - combines elements of both bottom-up</p><p>and top-down models, emphasizing the dynamic interaction</p><p>between the text and the reader, with meaning constructed</p><p>through a combination of decoding and personal</p><p>interpretation.</p><p>4. Schema Theory - suggests that readers bring to the text their</p><p>own pre-existing knowledge and experiences, which are used</p><p>to create a mental framework or schema for interpreting and</p><p>understanding the text.</p><p>5. Transactional Theory - views reading as a dynamic process of</p><p>meaning-making, with the reader and text in a constant state</p><p>of interaction and mutual influence, and meaning constructed</p><p>through a combination of text, reader, and context.</p><br />
