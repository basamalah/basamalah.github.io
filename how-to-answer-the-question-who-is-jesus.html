But you will welcome people who come on their own How could you possibly believe? You like to have your friends praise you, and you don't care about the praise that the only God can give! Don' think that I will be the one to accuse you to the Father. You have put your hope in Moses, yet he is the very one who will accuse you.

                                            can someone answer this?The Story of ZacchaeusOne day Jesus traveled through a town named Jericho on his way to Jerusalem. A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1. Who was Zacchaeus?2. Why didn’t people like him?3. How did Jesus treat Zacchaeus?4. How did Zacchaeus change after meeting Jesus?5. Why is honesty important in our relationships with other people?​</a>

                                            Please help me answer this question this has a story here is the storyA new life of saulThere was a man name Saul who hated the followers of Jesus and wanted to kill them. One day, he asked permission from the chief priest to arrest Jesus' followers. Upon getting the permission, Saul proceeded to Damascus where many of Jesus' followers can be found. On his way, he saw a bright light, causing him to fall from his horse. Then head a voice asking him, "Saul, Saul, why are you hurting Me so much?" Saul asked, "Who are you?" Then, the voice answered, "I am Jesus of Nazareth." The voice also told Saul to stand up and go to Damascus. But when Saul opened his eyes, he found out that he was blind. The men who were with him who heard the voice, too, brought Saul to Damascus.in Damascus, God instructed a disciple named Ananias to visit Saul. Ananiasimmediately went and upon seeing Saul, laid his hands on him. He told Saul that Jesus has sent him that he may regain his sight and receive the Holy Spirit. At once, Saul was able to see e again. Then, Saul got up and had himself baptized by Ananias. Saul stayed for a few days in Damascus and together with some disciples, hebegan to proclaim Jesus as the "Son of God." All who heard him were surprised for they knew that he was the man who wanted to arrest those who believe in Jesus. But Saul grew even stronger and proclaimed even more convincingly to the Jaws that indeed, "Jesus is the Messiah." dre Toleprepare Saul shows us how we should prepare for Jesus' gift of a new life. He obeys Jesus when He tells him to go to Damascus and stay there. Saul stops persecuting the followers of Jesus and allows Ananias baptize him. After receiving the gift of new life from Jesus, Saul starts proclaiming Jesus as the Son of God. Those who know him cannot believe that he is now doing what he wanted the followers of Jesus to stop doing Clearly, when Saul accepts Jesus Saul invitation for him to lead a new life, it produces many challenges in him, the greatest of which was his decision to proclaim by his words and actions that Jesus is the Messiah.We, too, are called to do the same. Just as we make the necessary preparations for changes in our lives, we also must prepare for the new life that Jesus offers to eachone of us.Like Saul, we must also stop committing sins and starts a life that is faithful to God. Our acceptance of Jesus' invitation to a new life should lead us to show others who Jesus is and what He has done out of love for us.​</a>

Better pay, higher position - these did not even come to mind. I prayed for direction. No position in other companies was open and no job offer came. For a year, I tried to be patient. A time came when I was no longer sad. I had accepted my place and found joy in little things. No doubt I still wanted a new job, but there was faith and assurance that God would fulfill his purpose for me and his will would be done. Soon enough, I received not one but two job offers! Trough the whole year waiting experience, I found that I became stronger and learned more about Jesus and myself. Had this been the old me, I would have just been irritated and impatient and resigned. I would have been angry and negative. But in Jesus, the former things have come. "Anxious," "weak" come be turned to "trusting", "being patient." Just goes to show that the Lord really does change our attitude in life. Answer the following questions: 1.

II. Read Mary's Magnificat (The Prayer of Mary) below.
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, 
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant. 
From this day all generations will call me blessed: 
the Almighty has done great things for me, 
and holy is his Name.
He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation. 
He has shown the strength of his arm, 
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, 
and has lifted up the lowly. 
He has filled the hungry with good things, 
and the rich he has sent away empty.
He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he remembered his promise of mercy, 
the promise he made to our fathers, 
to Abraham and his children forever.

                                            Read the paragraph. Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways. One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016).

What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot. Theme refers to the author's message about life or human nature he or she tries to convey in the story. The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</a>

                                            Gospel According to John, the author retells a conversation between Jesus of Nazareth, who is on trial, and Pontius Pilate, the governor of the Roman province of Judaea. Toward the end of the interrogation, Jesus tells Pilate, “Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” Infamously, Pilate responds, “What is truth?” Pilate’s tone is not clear. Was he asking a genuine question out of curiosity? Was he being sarcastic? Or was he asking the question in desperation, following a lifelong, exhausting search for the truth? We don’t know. What we do know is that he didn’t stick around for an answer. So, what is truth? Philosophers have struggled with this question since the dawn of time, perhaps because it’s the hardest question ever asked. The field of epistemology is the subdiscipline of philosophy that grapples it, along with the nature of knowledge itself. The question, “What do we know and how do we know it?” occupies the mind of the epistemologist. The prevailing theory of truth, at least among the public and certainly among scientists, is the correspondence theory, which states that truth corresponds with facts and reality. It’s a good theory, especially since it’s practical and governs our day-to-day interactions. If I’m holding a tart, reddish-yellow, spherical fruit, I’m holding a Cosmic Crisp apple. There is no alternative theory of truth that could convince me that it’s a limousine. Likewise, business contracts, the judicial system, and society as a whole are built around the idea that truth corresponds to reality. Science still can’t answer the biggest — and arguably, most important — questions in life. Many scientists would take this a step further and argue that the scientific method is the foremost system for determining facts. Therefore, science is the best tool to determine reality and truth. But this is where things start to get tricky. Philosophers vs. Scientists At least two philosophers have presented substantial challenges to the epistemic privilege of science. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), David Hume argues that inductive logic is unjustified. Inductive logic is the process of making observations and then drawing larger conclusions from limited data. When astrophysicists make a claim like, “All stars are flaming balls of hydrogen and helium,” that grand, sweeping claim is based on observing lots and lots of stars and observing the same thing over and over again. But they haven’t observed all the stars in the universe. Further, there is no guarantee that future stars will resemble past stars. So how can they really know for sure? That might sound like a childish objection, but consider this: At one time, Europeans believed that all swans are white. After all, everywhere they looked, they saw white swans. The swans on the river, the swans on the lake — all white. But then, one intrepid European (Willem de Vlamingh) went to Australia in 1697 and saw black swans. In this instance, inductive logic failed. This is the basis of Hume’s argument that inductive logic is unjustified. ​</a>

What – 1Why – 1Who – 2 Where - 2When – 1 Whose- 1Which - 1How - 1The Parable of the SowerThat same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore.  Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.  Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.  Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.  Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.  The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.  But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.  The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”​</a>

He is someone to look up to, he is the real hero. … I think Jesus was sent down from God, which means Jesus is God’s son.  –Jesus is my Savior.

Our sin has separated us from God — our corruption is to such a degree that we cannot know Him personally and cannot experience His love. God's Word says,<br />

                            5. can someone answer this?The Story of ZacchaeusOne day Jesus traveled through a town named Jericho on his way to Jerusalem. A big crowd had gathered to see him, including a man named Zacchaeus who worked as a tax collector. He was short and didn't have many friends. In fact, most people hated him. Tax collectors gathered money from the people to give to the government. Some of them were dishonest and took more money than they were supposed to and kept the extra coins for themselves. Zacchaeus wasn’t honest. He got very rich from other people’s money.But then Zacchaeus met Jesus. He was curious about who he was and climbed a tree to see Jesus over the crowds (he was very short). As Jesus came by, he stopped right under the tree where Zacchaeus was waiting. Jesus looked up at Zacchaeus and told him to come down because he wanted to have a visit with him at his house!Zacchaeus eagerly took Jesus home with him. He felt God’s love and forgiveness for all his dishonesty in the past. Meeting Jesus changed his heart. He wanted to make things right! He promised to give 4 x more than he took and shared his wealth with the poor. He became a follower of Jesus and lived his life with honesty in both his words and actions.Discussion Questions1.

He is known primarily for his faith in climbing a sycamore tree to see Jesus, and also his generosity in giving half of all he possessed. A descendant of Abraham, he was an example of Jesus's personal, earthly mission to bring salvation to the lost.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Zacchaeus was a tax collector who lived in Jericho. Many people hated Zacchaeus, not only because he was rich and powerful, but also because they thought that he was a sinner because of his job. Zacchaeus heard that Jesus was coming to visit Jericho, and wanted to see him.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Jesus looked up and said, “Hurry down, Zacchaeus, because I must stay in your house today.” The people started grumbling because Jesus was going to the home of a sinner. However, Zacchaeus promised to give half his belongings to the poor and pay back four times as much to anyone he had cheated.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Zacchaeus showed he was willing to change by offering half of his belongings to the poor and paying back four times as much to anyone he had cheated. This amount was what the Old Testament law demanded as a repayment for dishonesty.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Honesty is the foundation for trust in a relationship, and trust is necessary for a relationship to function and thrive. When you're always honest with someone, it tells them that they can trust you and the things you say.

                            11. Please help me answer this question this has a story here is the storyA new life of saulThere was a man name Saul who hated the followers of Jesus and wanted to kill them. One day, he asked permission from the chief priest to arrest Jesus' followers. Upon getting the permission, Saul proceeded to Damascus where many of Jesus' followers can be found. On his way, he saw a bright light, causing him to fall from his horse. Then head a voice asking him, "Saul, Saul, why are you hurting Me so much?" Saul asked, "Who are you?" Then, the voice answered, "I am Jesus of Nazareth." The voice also told Saul to stand up and go to Damascus. But when Saul opened his eyes, he found out that he was blind. The men who were with him who heard the voice, too, brought Saul to Damascus.in Damascus, God instructed a disciple named Ananias to visit Saul. Ananiasimmediately went and upon seeing Saul, laid his hands on him. He told Saul that Jesus has sent him that he may regain his sight and receive the Holy Spirit. At once, Saul was able to see e again. Then, Saul got up and had himself baptized by Ananias. Saul stayed for a few days in Damascus and together with some disciples, hebegan to proclaim Jesus as the "Son of God." All who heard him were surprised for they knew that he was the man who wanted to arrest those who believe in Jesus. But Saul grew even stronger and proclaimed even more convincingly to the Jaws that indeed, "Jesus is the Messiah." dre Toleprepare Saul shows us how we should prepare for Jesus' gift of a new life. He obeys Jesus when He tells him to go to Damascus and stay there. Saul stops persecuting the followers of Jesus and allows Ananias baptize him. After receiving the gift of new life from Jesus, Saul starts proclaiming Jesus as the Son of God. Those who know him cannot believe that he is now doing what he wanted the followers of Jesus to stop doing Clearly, when Saul accepts Jesus Saul invitation for him to lead a new life, it produces many challenges in him, the greatest of which was his decision to proclaim by his words and actions that Jesus is the Messiah.We, too, are called to do the same. Just as we make the necessary preparations for changes in our lives, we also must prepare for the new life that Jesus offers to eachone of us.Like Saul, we must also stop committing sins and starts a life that is faithful to God. Our acceptance of Jesus' invitation to a new life should lead us to show others who Jesus is and what He has done out of love for us.​</h2><br />

                            12.                         A New Name I need a job change - the office was just too far which meant little or no time for rest, prayer, and so on. Better pay, higher position - these did not even come to mind. I prayed for direction. No position in other companies was open and no job offer came. For a year, I tried to be patient. A time came when I was no longer sad. I had accepted my place and found joy in little things. No doubt I still wanted a new job, but there was faith and assurance that God would fulfill his purpose for me and his will would be done. Soon enough, I received not one but two job offers! Trough the whole year waiting experience, I found that I became stronger and learned more about Jesus and myself. Had this been the old me, I would have just been irritated and impatient and resigned. I would have been angry and negative. But in Jesus, the former things have come. "Anxious," "weak" come be turned to "trusting", "being patient." Just goes to show that the Lord really does change our attitude in life. Answer the following questions: 1.

II. Read Mary's Magnificat (The Prayer of Mary) below.
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, 
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant. 
From this day all generations will call me blessed: 
the Almighty has done great things for me, 
and holy is his Name.
He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation. 
He has shown the strength of his arm, 
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, 
and has lifted up the lowly. 
He has filled the hungry with good things, 
and the rich he has sent away empty.
He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he remembered his promise of mercy, 
the promise he made to our fathers, 
to Abraham and his children forever.

                            19. Read the paragraph. Asma's letter on Christmas is different in some ways. One, it isn't a greeting card. Two, it is a letter addressed to Jesus Christ who is not a common person, relative, friend, or acquaintance. Jesus, for the Christians, is the Son of Mary. And three, the letter is asking for some explanation of the untoward happenings here on planet Earth. Lastly, the letter will not be mailed but will be placed on the altar for the angels to carry to Jesus. Amazingly different in three ways, the letter holds the greatest message of all time-the message of love and justice, of brotherhood, and sisterhood. (Castillo, K.E. (2016).

What examples, reasons, or facts are presented to validate the generalization? What words or phrases introduce them? Remember that generalizations are like "big umbrellas." A summary restates only the main points of a text without giving examples or details such as dates, numbers or statistics. When you summarize, you keep in mind the answers to the (5) Wh's and How questions. Texts are written for a variety of purposes, using different forms and standards of composition. These forms of writing are known as text type. There are two main text types, factual and literary. Factual text types include factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include poetry, narrative or personal response. One of its kind is the narrative text. It is a type of literary text that tells a story. It presents series of events which can either be fiction or non-fiction. Fiction narrative may include picture books, cartoons, fantasy, adventure, science fiction, fairy tales, legends, fables or plays. Non-fiction narratives include autobiography, biography, memoir, diary and others. The basic elements of narrative include the theme, setting, characters and plot. Theme refers to the author's message about life or human nature he or she tries to convey in the story. The setting answers the when and where the story happens and the characters are the people, animals or things playing an important role for the events. The plot consists of the episodes happened from beginning, middle and ending events.please. po pasagot</h2><br />

This is stated in the last sentence of the paragraph. The examples presented to validate this generalization are the three ways in which Asma's letter is different from a typical Christmas greeting card, and the message of love and justice that the letter contains. The words and phrases that introduce these examples are "One, it isn't a greeting card.

 and how was the universe created?
sa isip ku yan eh okay lang kung di niyo alam hehe</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>We ask, "If all things have a creator, then who created God?" Actually, only created things have a creator, so it's improper to lump God with his creation. God has revealed himself to us in the Bible as having always existed. Atheists counter that there is no reason to assume the universe was created.</strong><p></p><strong>No one created God. God got created as the universe grew and changes. God is the cumulative energy of the universe. So, infact universe created God.</strong><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> In this pandemic, We help and encourage Others and each others to help and follow our LORD savior JESUS CHRIST. I know in this times, we highly need his Power to protect us in times of needy. We might loose hope, but always remember he will never leave us and he will be the one to guide our path.

I just want to tell That someday They can get over this pain And they will experience the Non unconditional Love and hope they waited for such a long time. They don't need hatred and envy, they need Love and sympathy</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>sori mahaba hehe sunod sunod kase ang idea ko eh:)</p><br />

                            26. Gospel According to John, the author retells a conversation between Jesus of Nazareth, who is on trial, and Pontius Pilate, the governor of the Roman province of Judaea. Toward the end of the interrogation, Jesus tells Pilate, “Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.” Infamously, Pilate responds, “What is truth?” Pilate’s tone is not clear. Was he asking a genuine question out of curiosity? Was he being sarcastic? Or was he asking the question in desperation, following a lifelong, exhausting search for the truth? We don’t know. What we do know is that he didn’t stick around for an answer. So, what is truth? Philosophers have struggled with this question since the dawn of time, perhaps because it’s the hardest question ever asked. The field of epistemology is the subdiscipline of philosophy that grapples it, along with the nature of knowledge itself. The question, “What do we know and how do we know it?” occupies the mind of the epistemologist. The prevailing theory of truth, at least among the public and certainly among scientists, is the correspondence theory, which states that truth corresponds with facts and reality. It’s a good theory, especially since it’s practical and governs our day-to-day interactions. If I’m holding a tart, reddish-yellow, spherical fruit, I’m holding a Cosmic Crisp apple. There is no alternative theory of truth that could convince me that it’s a limousine. Likewise, business contracts, the judicial system, and society as a whole are built around the idea that truth corresponds to reality. Science still can’t answer the biggest — and arguably, most important — questions in life. Many scientists would take this a step further and argue that the scientific method is the foremost system for determining facts. Therefore, science is the best tool to determine reality and truth. But this is where things start to get tricky. Philosophers vs. Scientists At least two philosophers have presented substantial challenges to the epistemic privilege of science. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), David Hume argues that inductive logic is unjustified. Inductive logic is the process of making observations and then drawing larger conclusions from limited data. When astrophysicists make a claim like, “All stars are flaming balls of hydrogen and helium,” that grand, sweeping claim is based on observing lots and lots of stars and observing the same thing over and over again. But they haven’t observed all the stars in the universe. Further, there is no guarantee that future stars will resemble past stars. So how can they really know for sure? That might sound like a childish objection, but consider this: At one time, Europeans believed that all swans are white. After all, everywhere they looked, they saw white swans. The swans on the river, the swans on the lake — all white. But then, one intrepid European (Willem de Vlamingh) went to Australia in 1697 and saw black swans. In this instance, inductive logic failed. This is the basis of Hume’s argument that inductive logic is unjustified. ​</h2><br />

It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.  Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.  Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.  The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.  But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.  The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”​</h2><br />

The first seed represents those who find it very hard to understand the word and as a result of this, the devil came and snatched away from their heart. The same case is with the second seed but with different interpretation while the last one are those who represent the true defintion of Christianity. Those are the true follower of Christ; those who believe in the word and practicalise it.</p><p></p><br />
