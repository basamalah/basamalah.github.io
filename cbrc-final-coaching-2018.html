                            4. Is the athletes/ or someone undergoing coaching accountable to a desirable coaching outcome? Or is it only to the coach solely? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Both the athletes and the coach are accountable for a desirable coaching outcome. </p><p></p><p>The coach is responsible for creating and implementing effective training plans, providing feedback, and motivating the athletes. They are also responsible for creating a positive and supportive team environment where athletes feel encouraged to reach their full potential. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, athletes are responsible for putting in the effort, following the training plans, and communicating effectively with the coach. They are also responsible for taking ownership of their own development and progress towards their goals. </p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the success of coaching is a collaborative effort between the coach and the athletes. Both parties must work together, communicate effectively, and hold each other accountable to achieve the desired outcomes.</p><br />

And the life there…it's poor, and it's very sad. And I've always taught myself to look for the beauty in it. To look in the beauty in the faces of the children, and to be grateful. And I would bring this aspect as a Miss Universe to see situations with a silver lining, and to assess, where I could give something, where I could provide something, as a spokesperson, and if I could teach also people to be grateful, we could have an amazing world where negativity could not grow and foster, and children would have a smile on their faces." </p><p><strong>Miss South Africa: Tamaryn Green, </strong>"Throughout my life, I've been exposed to both those who are privileged and underprivileged. And what I’ve learned is that we are all human. We all want to be loved, we all want to belong, and we all want to be seen, so we should treat each other that way. Thank you.”</p><p><strong>Miss Venezuela: Sthefany Gutiérrez, </strong>"I grew up in a family filled with women and each one of them taught me something very important. But what I always remembered is that by working hard and chasing for our dreams, and by having courage and strength and willingness to achieve these dreams, we can achieve anything we want in this lifetime. And tonight I am proving this, I am here at Miss Universe."</p><p></p><p><strong>Their answers are all coming from their experiences and they valued it as they applied it to their daily lives.</strong> The differences of their answers are <strong>Ms. South Africa focuses on equal treatment of people</strong> regardless of their economic status. <strong>Ms. Venezuela explained that everyone must have courage and strength in order to achieve your dreams. </strong>While <strong>Ms. Philippines described her experience and work in Tondo, Manila and the status of the lives of children living the area.</strong> She sounds more selfless and learned from the experiences of the others that she used as an inspiration to achieve more to make their situations better.
