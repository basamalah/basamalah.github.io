                                            Procedure: Read and analyze the scenario that follows, then answer the questions. More than a century ago, the inhabitants in the Dutch East Indies were attacked by a strange nerve disease now identifies as beriberi. Infected persons lost their appetite, developed inflammation of the nerves, and became paralyzed. The most common manifestation of thiamine deficiency is beri-beri, which is characterized by a peripheral sensorimotor axonal neuropathy with numbness, paresthesias, or burning pain, occasionally accompanied by peripheral edema from heart failure ("wet beri-beri"). Other causes of thiamine deficiency include reliance on foods in which the vitamin has been inactivated by processing (eg, polished rice), overcooking, or eating foods that contain thiaminase-producing bacteria (eg, raw fish). Deficiency also contributes to the neuropathy of chemotherapy. Thiamine deficiency has been reported to cause the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Scientists who first studied the outbreak thought that the disease might be caused by bacteria. To discover answers to their questions and to properly understand the disease, the scientists obtained blood samples from beriben patients fell ill. Surprisingly, even the control group suffered from the illness. Dr. Christian Eijkman, a member of the group of scientists working on the disease, observes that before the experiment, all the chickens were fed with polished rice. Dr Eikman later found out that whole-grain rice contains high amounts of vitamin B1 or thiamine, a vitamin necessary for good health, which enable the body to use carbohydrates as energy. It plays a key role in nerve, muscle, and heart functions. Thiamine is absent is polished rice.POST-LABORATORY QUESTION1. WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM? 2. WHAT WAS THE HYPOTHESIS? 3.

The essence of structuralism is the belief that things cannot be understood in isolation, they have to be seen in thecontext of larger structures which contain them.5. Feminist criticism attempts to correct this balance by evaluating and combatung such attitudes-by questioning, forexample, why none of the characters in Shakespeare's play Othello ever challenge the right of a husband to murder a wife accused ofadultery.6. Gender Crrücism is originally an offshoot of feminist movements, gender criticism today includes a number ofapproaches, Including the so-called "masculinist approach recently advocated by poet Robert Bly.7. Like an essay, a critique uses a informal, academic writing style and has a clear structure, that is, an introduction, bodyand conclusion8.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>1. A sometimes weak immune systemOur body can be compared to a castle that needs to be protected. Inside and like the guards, is our immune system which defends our body against intruders. It is notably composed of cells (such as white blood cells, lymphocytes) and organs (such as, for example, the thymus, the spleen). When bacteria enter our body, these guards take care of identifying them. If they seem dangerous to him, he destroys them. But before destroying them, it saves them, in order to identify them and eliminate them more quickly the next time. Only, because of the cold, poor diet or lack of sleep, but also in babies or the elderly, the immune system is more fragile. <p></p>2. Microbes and viruses, not very convenient intrudersThere are several types of microbes including viruses carrying the flu, colds, chickenpox, fungi known to be the cause of allergies, fungal infections and bacteria. Some from food (such as dairy products, bread, yeast) and, in moderate doses, are essential for the proper functioning of our body. But others, on the other hand, can cause different diseases such as urinary tract infections, food poisoning. When the immune system lowers its guard, these microbes take advantage of it to multiply and we get sick.<p></p>3. In the majority of cases, the common cold goes away on its own. No treatment can get rid of the virus faster.In fact, the treatment essentially aims to make the cold less painful by relieving the symptoms: sore throat, headache, nasal congestion.Since the common cold is caused by a virus and not by bacteria, antibiotics are ineffective.<p></p>4. All drugs intended to have an action on the body pass into the bloodstream. By this route, the future of the drug – or rather of its active ingredient – ​​is commonly divided into four main stages: absorption, distribution in the body, metabolism and elimination.<p></p>5. When a drug is administered/taken, the active substance of that drug enters the circulation and reaches its intended target in the blood stream. Once the drug has reached the area of ​​the body to be treated, it acts locally on the cells and produces the desired effects.6. The absorption of a drug is determined by its physico-chemical properties, its galenic formulation and its route of administration. Different formulations (eg, tablets, capsules, solutions) containing the active ingredient and excipients are prepared for administration by different routes (eg, oral, buccal, sublingual, rectal, parenteral, topical, and by inhalation ). Regardless of the route of administration, drugs must be in solution to be absorbed. Thus, solid forms (eg, tablets) must be able to disintegrate and break down.7. Passive broadcastDrugs diffuse across a cell membrane along a concentration gradient, from a region of high concentration (eg, gastrointestinal fluids) to a region of low concentration (eg, blood). The diffusion rate is directly proportional to this gradient and also depends on the liposolubility of the molecule, its size, its degree of ionization and the absorption surface. Since the cell membrane is lipid in nature, fat-soluble drugs diffuse faster. Small molecules are likely to cross membranes faster than large molecules.<p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/25003488</p><br />

                            10. Procedure: Read and analyze the scenario that follows, then answer the questions. More than a century ago, the inhabitants in the Dutch East Indies were attacked by a strange nerve disease now identifies as beriberi. Infected persons lost their appetite, developed inflammation of the nerves, and became paralyzed. The most common manifestation of thiamine deficiency is beri-beri, which is characterized by a peripheral sensorimotor axonal neuropathy with numbness, paresthesias, or burning pain, occasionally accompanied by peripheral edema from heart failure ("wet beri-beri"). Other causes of thiamine deficiency include reliance on foods in which the vitamin has been inactivated by processing (eg, polished rice), overcooking, or eating foods that contain thiaminase-producing bacteria (eg, raw fish). Deficiency also contributes to the neuropathy of chemotherapy. Thiamine deficiency has been reported to cause the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Scientists who first studied the outbreak thought that the disease might be caused by bacteria. To discover answers to their questions and to properly understand the disease, the scientists obtained blood samples from beriben patients fell ill. Surprisingly, even the control group suffered from the illness. Dr. Christian Eijkman, a member of the group of scientists working on the disease, observes that before the experiment, all the chickens were fed with polished rice. Dr Eikman later found out that whole-grain rice contains high amounts of vitamin B1 or thiamine, a vitamin necessary for good health, which enable the body to use carbohydrates as energy. It plays a key role in nerve, muscle, and heart functions. Thiamine is absent is polished rice.POST-LABORATORY QUESTION1. WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM? 2. WHAT WAS THE HYPOTHESIS? 3.

Then write youranswer on the space provided before the number.1. The body of a critique includes a summary of the work and a detailed evaluation._2. A key goal for historical critics is to realize the effect of a literary work upon its original readers.3. A main goal for formalist critics is to determine how elements of form (style, structure, tone, imagery, etc.) work togetherwith the text's content to shape its effects upon readers.-4. The essence of structuralism is the belief that things cannot be understood in isolation, they have to be seen in thecontext of larger structures which contain them.5. Feminist criticism attempts to correct this balance by evaluating and combatung such attitudes-by questioning, forexample, why none of the characters in Shakespeare's play Othello ever challenge the right of a husband to murder a wife accused ofadultery.6. Gender Crrücism is originally an offshoot of feminist movements, gender criticism today includes a number ofapproaches, Including the so-called "masculinist approach recently advocated by poet Robert Bly.7. Like an essay, a critique uses a informal, academic writing style and has a clear structure, that is, an introduction, bodyand conclusion8. Critique is a genre of academic writing that briefly summarizes and critically evaluates a work or concept.9. Before you start writing, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the work that will be critiqued._10.
