By preserving our culture, we are able to connect with our ancestors and learn from the wisdom of past generations.</p><p></p><p>Second, our culture provides us with a sense of belonging and identity. Knowing our heritage gives us a sense of pride and connection to our community. It helps to create a sense of unity among Filipino people, regardless of where we are from.</p><p></p><p>Finally, preserving our local heritage is essential for the future. Our culture is an important part of our national identity, and it is important that it is not forgotten.
