Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</a>

It suffered a huge set back in 2001 when the USA, responsible for a quarter of global emissions, pulled out. C. The planet’s climate is constantly changing but now scientists believe that the extreme changes taking place today are a result of human activity. The changes we see today may affect the stability of the climate on which much life on the planet depends. D. The term refers to the role played by the layer of gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, which trap the heat from the sun in the earth’s atmosphere. We need the layer to keep in some of the heat but now the concentration of gases, especially CO2 is increasing and retaining more heat. E. It is difficult to predict, but we can expect more extreme weather conditions like floods, storms and heat waves. Scientists believe there will be more rain but also a higher risk of drought in inland areas​</a>

One of the most recent human rights on which international relations should be based so that those who suffer or have less benefit from the help of the more affluent. This was one of the main reasons that led the United Nations General Assembly in December 2005 to proclaim 20 December of each year as the International Day of Human Solidarity.</p><p> </p><p></p><p>It is a quality that is based on equality, inclusion and social justice and that entails a mutual commitment and obligation among the various members of society and the global community. Therefore, in a context of globalization and the challenge of growing inequality, the strengthening of international solidarity in terms of assistance, development support and cooperation is essential.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        Importance of Communication in Globalization
<p>
Due to the various channels used to easily transmit and receive messages, communication is also an essential component of globalization. Because of eye contacts, body language, and proximity, in-person business communication will aid in the development of productive relationships. Globalization is thus characterized as the democratization and unification of the world's society, environment, and infrastructure. Globalization is thus characterized as the convergence and democratization of the world's society, environment, and technology by transnational investment, the rapid diffusion of communication and information technologies, and the effects of free markets on local, regional, and national economies.
</p><p>
</p><p>Education, commerce, and partnerships are all aided by communication. It also encourages international interaction and the settlement of conflicts. People may express themselves by communication, which leads to social and psychological well-being. Globalization refers to the worldwide interconnection between individuals and enterprises, which inevitably contributes to cultural, political, and economic convergence. That is the freedom to travel across the globe and deal freely with others in order to do foreign business. World problems that may have an impact on communication include: the abrupt emergence of issues in particular countries—this may have an impact on communication by prohibiting citizens from entering their countries or cutting off communications.
</p><p>
</p><p>We depend heavily on exchanging knowledge in today's hectic environment, so learning strong communication skills is more important than ever. In order to convey and interpret information efficiently and correctly, good verbal and written communication skills are required.

Reflect and respond to the followingstatements and questions: Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved going to school. However, she lived in an area where some political leaders didn’t want her to go to school. They used to attack the schools and try to stop girls going to school. Question: What would you do if the people with political power in your area attacked your school and said you (whether you are a boy or a girl) weren’t allowed to go anymore? So, one day this young girl, who was only eleven years old at the time, started to make speeches and write blogs saying that girls should be allowed to go to school as well. Question: How do you think the people with political power, who wereagainst girls in school, might have reacted when she started doing this?However, the people in power, who didn’t want girls to go to school, wanted to frighten her to stop her telling people these things. They knew lots of people around the world were listening to what she was saying, so they made it clear that they would harm her if she kept saying these things. Question: If someone threatened you for saying your opinion, would you stop or would you carry on anyway? The young girl did not stop saying her opinions. So, one day, when she was fourteen years old, a man came onto the bus when she was on her way back from school and shot her. The bullet hit her head. Luckily, this young girl did not die.Question: If you had been harmed for saying your opinions and survived, would you stop after that? She was taken to another country and she survived. She went on to finish school and continues to tell the world that girls should be allowed to go to school. Question: What do you think of this girl? Do you think what she did made an impact? Why/ why not? This girl is Malala Yousafzai and this happened between 2008 and 2012. In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and is now a leading global advocate championing the equal right to education for all, especially for girls.➢ Is Malala Yousafzai is a role model for you? Why / why not? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Women can be as good at being leaders and role models as men. ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Do you think we need more role models like Malala in the world and our local community? ______________________________________________________________________________➢ Could you be someone like Malala, passionate about something you believe in, in your local community?______________________________________________________________________________➢ As a student how can you become active contributors towards eradication of gender inequality, ______________________________________________​</h2><br />

                            16. 1. Discuss what is the difference between global and local community. 2. Cite at least 3 examples of community members who are present in your barangay (ex. Barangay tanod, barangay health workers, etc.), Explain their roles and functions. 3. Am I a responsible/productive members of my community? 4. What role am I playing in our community? 5. Am I making my community better?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1) The main difference between global and local communities is their scope and scale. A global community refers to a group of people connected by a common interest, goal or identity that transcends geographical boundaries. It includes people from different parts of the world who share a common goal or concern, such as human rights, climate change, or social justice. On the other hand, a local community refers to a group of people who share a common geographical location, such as a neighborhood, village, or town. The members of a local community interact more frequently and are more connected to each other through shared experiences and resources.</p><p></p><p>2) Examples of community members who are present in a barangay may include barangay tanod, barangay health workers, and barangay officials. Barangay tanod serves as the community's peace and order officers, while barangay health workers provide healthcare services and medical assistance to residents. Barangay officials, on the other hand, are elected officials who manage the barangay's affairs and ensure that government programs and services are delivered to the residents.</p><p></p><p>3) A guide to answer this question: To determine if you are a responsible/productive member of your community, you need to evaluate how you contribute to the community's growth and development. Ask yourself if you actively participate in community activities, follow rules and regulations, and support initiatives that benefit the community. Do you volunteer for community service projects, attend meetings and forums, and actively seek ways to improve your skills and knowledge? If yes, then you can consider yourself as a responsible and productive member of your community.</p><p></p><p>4) As an individual, your role in the community may vary depending on your skills, interests, and resources. Some examples of roles that you can play in the community include a volunteer, advocate, mentor, leader, and organizer. You can also contribute to the community by supporting local businesses, promoting cultural and artistic events, and being an active member of local groups and organizations.</p><p></p><p>5) Making your community better requires a collective effort from all members. You can contribute to the community's improvement by actively participating in community activities, supporting local businesses, volunteering for community service projects, and being a responsible citizen. By doing so, you can help build a stronger, more resilient, and more vibrant community that benefits everyone.</p><br />

                            17. What are the roles and impacts of these technologies in communication and globalization?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Globalization and information and communication technology (ICT) continue to change us and the world we live in. Nursing stands at an opportunity intersection where challenging global health issues, an international workforce shortage, and massive growth of ICT combine to create a very unique space for nursing leadership and nursing intervention. Learning from prior successes in the field can assist nurse leaders in planning and advancing strategies for global health using ICT. Attention to lessons learned will assist in combating the technological apartheid that is already present in many areas of the globe and will highlight opportunities for innovative applications in health. ICT has opened new channels of communication, creating the beginnings of a global information society that will facilitate access to isolated areas where health needs are extreme and where nursing can contribute significantly to the achievement of “Health for All.” The purpose of this article is to discuss the relationships between globalization, health, and ICT, and to illuminate opportunities for nursing in this flattening and increasingly interconnected world.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps!!</p><br />
