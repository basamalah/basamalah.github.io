                                            CASE STUDY In this case study we will consider a network administrator for a small, family-oriented video store. The store is not part of a chain of stores and has a very limited security budget. It has five machines for employees to use to check out movies and one server on which to keep centralized records. That server is in the manager’s office. The administrator takes the following security precautions: 1. Each machine is upgraded to Windows XP, with the personal firewall turned on. 2. Antivirus software was installed on all machines. 3. A tape backup is added to the server, and tapes are kept in a file cabinet in the manager’s office. 4. Internet access to employee machines is removed. Now consider these questions: 1. What did these actions accomplish? 2. What additional actions might you recommend?</a>

She strongly believed in slogan " When in Rome do as Roman's do", but in recent years she has been forced to rethink that position. In 2019, when the company considered opening a manufacturing branch in South Africa, it finally decided against the move, because of the existing apartheid laws which mandated racial segregation and discrimination against blacks. She is now faced  with 3 some what similar situations or were they similar? First, the company has the opportunity to contract at an excellent price for fabric woven in China. However, she has reports that the fabric probably came from factories employing forced labor. A second opportunity is to buy clothing manufactured in Pakistan. Again, however she has a reports from her sources that they are using child labor, usually girls under 14 year old. Her third opportunity is to open a plant in Saudi Arabia. In this situation she is warned that for the operation to be successful, women should not be placed in executive positions because they would not be taken seriously by those with they had to deal.Follow the basic case study format in answering the case study:a.

Here are some recommendations to avoid office romance:</p><p></p><p>Establish a clear workplace policy: Companies can create a clear workplace policy on office romance that outlines what is acceptable behavior and what isn't. The policy should be communicated to all employees, and there should be consequences for violating the policy.</p><p></p><p>Separate personal and professional lives: Employees should keep their personal lives separate from their professional lives. This means not using work time to engage in personal activities, such as dating or flirting with coworkers.</p><p></p><p>Avoid one-on-one interactions: It's best to avoid situations where employees are alone with each other, such as private meetings or lunches. Instead, try to have group meetings or involve a third party to avoid any misunderstandings.</p><p></p><p>Be mindful of body language: Employees should be mindful of their body language and avoid any behaviors that could be perceived as flirtatious or suggestive.</p><p></p><p>Prioritize professionalism: Employees should prioritize professionalism and focus on their work while at the office. This means avoiding any behavior that could be perceived as unprofessional or distracting.</p><p></p><p>Be respectful of boundaries: Employees should respect each other's boundaries and avoid pressuring coworkers into romantic relationships or unwanted advances.</p><p></p><p>pa-braínliest nalang po.ty</p><p></p><p>Overall, it's important to create a professional work environment that values productivity and teamwork while minimizing the risk of office romance.

Mini Case Study
Mr. Kim, a supermarket manager, asks Sam to submit a report, which
includes a background analysis of some data and recommendations based
on the interpretation of that data. Mr. Kim asks Sam to get the report
together within two weeks. Off Sam goes. He delegates the research, the
analysis, and report writing to one of his subordinates, Sung, who
completes the work in ten days and gives the report to Sam. Sam takes
Sung's work, reads it, is satisfied with the content, retypes the page to
show his name, not Sung's, and then submits it to Mr. Kim as if it were his
work. He accepts praise and
dit to Sung, who in fact, did the

research and wrote the repor
Guide Questions:
1. What is your reaction to Sam's act?
2. What do you think will be the reactions of Sung if he discovered it? How
about Mr. Kim's reactions?
3. How can you apply virtue ethics in this case?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.objectively speaking, Sam's act of taking credit for Sung's work is unethical and dishonest.</p><p></p><p>2. If Sung discovers that Sam took credit for his work, he may feel disrespected, unappreciated, and betrayed. He may also lose trust in Sam and their working relationship may be affected. On the other hand, if Mr. Kim finds out, he may lose trust in Sam's abilities to manage and lead his team. He may also question Sam's integrity and honesty.</p><p></p><p>3. Virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of character and moral virtues in making ethical decisions. In this case, Sam's act of taking credit for Sung's work goes against virtues such as honesty, integrity, and fairness. Applying virtue ethics, Sam should have acknowledged Sung's contribution and given him credit for his work. He should have acted with honesty and fairness towards Sung and Mr. Kim.</p><p></p><br />

                            18. CASE STUDY:A 53-year old policeman man was rushed to the emergency room with complaints of chest pain. The attending physician noted that it might be a possible myocardial infarction. Laboratory tests and procedural assessment such as ECG monitoring is done and revealed sinus tachycardia.As the RT on duty, the physician asked you to administer nitroglycerin to decrease the chest pain felt by the patient. And you note that the patient's respiration is 20 breaths per minute and SpO2 is 92% of room air.Questions:1. What is your assessment of the patient’s oxygenation status?2. What is your recommendation in regards to administration of supplemental oxygen?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. Oxygenation may be assessed by clinical assessment, pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases. Pulse oximetry is commonly used to obtain a rapid and continuous assessment of oxygenation. Pulse oximetry measures oxygen saturation, which is the percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen [2].<p></p><p></p>2. Normal levels of arterial blood oxygen are between 75 and 100 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). An oxygen level of 60 mmHg or lower indicates the need for supplemental oxygen. Too much oxygen can be dangerous as well, and can damage the cells in your lungs. Your oxygen level should not go above 110 mmHg.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>#StudyFirst ➕#Brainlest ☀#Thank ❤ #Rate ⭐ #Follow ☺<br />
