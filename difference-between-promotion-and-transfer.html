                                            Using celebrities in advertising dates back to the late nineteenth century, and this common advertising practice has drawn a considerate amount of academic and practical attention (see Erdogan 1999 for an extensive review). Most academic investigations of celebrity endorsement have been contextualized in the realm of source credibility and attractiveness models, and suggest that celebrities exert their influence on consumers through perceived attributes such as expertise. trustworthiness, attractiveness, familiarity and likeability (Ohanian 1990, 1991). Another stream of research on celebrity endorsement, which is labeled the "match-up hypothesis." has examined the fit or match between a celebrity and the product being endorsed, and maintains that celebrity endorsement is more effective when the images or characteristics of the celebrity are well matched with the endorsed products (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990; Kamins and Gupta 1994; Till and Busier 2000). In similar vein, McCracken suggests that a "celebrity who best represents the appropriate symbolic properties" of the product should be selected, thus highlighting the importance of the cultural meanings of the celebrities in the endorsement process. Celebrities embody a collection of culturally relevant images, symbols, and values. As images of the celebrities become associated with products through endorsement, the meanings they attach to the products are transferred to consumers through purchase and consumption (McCracken 1989, 316). Therefore, the practice of celebrity endorsement should be closely related to the cultural context in which the images of celebrities are formed and individual celebrities are selected to be linked with particular products. For advertising practitioners, employing an appropriate celebrity endorser to promote a product is important but a difficult task. For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.

                                            ACTIVITY IV. Read and analyze the following literature review very carefully. Then,
complete the table that follows.
Kram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature
over time, providing different levels of mentoring functions as they progress
through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation,
and redefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin
initial interactions that involve learning the other’s personal style and work habits.
He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized by
musings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and
visibility, the mentor embodies as fantasized role model with whom the protégé
begins to identify and develops positive expectations about career
development. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then
progresses to the cultivation phase, in which career development, role modeling
and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram
(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and
protégé deepens and intimacy increases during this phase. This phase may last
from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentor
promotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor,
and the mentor gains loyalty and support of the protégé and feelings that his or
her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the
cultivation phase. The third phase, separation, involves a structural and
psychological disconnection between the mentor and the protégé when
functions provided by the mentor decrease, and the protégé becomes
independent. In the redefinition phase, the mentor and protégé frequently
develop a relationship that is more peer-like, characterized by mutual support
and informal contact. While career and psychosocial functions are less evident,
sponsorship from a distance, occasional counseling and coaching and ongoing
friendship continue. Hay (1995) believes that mentoring process is underpinned by
the following principles: recognizing that people are okay, realizing that people
can change and want to grow, understanding how people learn, recognizing
individual differences, empowering through personal and professional
development, developing competence, encouraging collaboration not
competition, encouraging scholarship and a sense of inquiry, searching for new

According to Mackimm, et al (2003) mentoring relationship is a special
relationship where two people make real connection. It is a protected
relationship in which learning and experimentation occur through analysis,
examination, reexamination and reflection on practice, situations, problems,
mistakes and successes (of both the mentors and the mentees) to identify
learning opportunities and gaps. According to Yang (2006), mentoring
relationships range from loosely defined, informal collegial associations in which
a mentee learns by observation and example to structured formal agreements
between expert and novice co-mentors where each develops professionally
through the two-way transfer of experience and perspective. Whether the
relationship is formal or informal, the goal of mentoring is to provide career
advice as well as both professional and personal enrichment. It is important that
the mentor and the mentee have a clear grasp of the mentoring process for
maximum benefits of this special relationship. For mentoring to be effective, the
mentee together with the mentor needs to reflect on the experiences in school
and attempts to understand the experience through analysis and
conceptualization. The individual makes choices based on analyzing the
implications. She/he identifies options, decides on what to do next and
undergoes another experience.
Mentoring relationship is classified as formal or informal, and short term or long
term (Goodyear, 2006). Formal mentoring is usually mandatory and
institutionalized by the school or agency. The meetings are determined,
monitored and evaluated based on clearly articulated goals and milestones.
Informal mentoring relationship is more spontaneous and springs from the
mentee’s intrinsic desire to become better. The choice of the mentor is based on
trust and confidence. Another type of mentoring is the duration of the
relationship which can be short term and long term. A short term mentoring
usually addresses a set of specific needs. Long term mentoring is based on the
broad based goals incorporated in the professional development career of the
institution or agency. Whether the mentoring relationship is formal or informal,
short term or long term, literature proves that mentoring has improved the
teacher’s personal artistry and professional skill in the workplace.

                            2. Using celebrities in advertising dates back to the late nineteenth century, and this common advertising practice has drawn a considerate amount of academic and practical attention (see Erdogan 1999 for an extensive review). Most academic investigations of celebrity endorsement have been contextualized in the realm of source credibility and attractiveness models, and suggest that celebrities exert their influence on consumers through perceived attributes such as expertise. trustworthiness, attractiveness, familiarity and likeability (Ohanian 1990, 1991). Another stream of research on celebrity endorsement, which is labeled the "match-up hypothesis." has examined the fit or match between a celebrity and the product being endorsed, and maintains that celebrity endorsement is more effective when the images or characteristics of the celebrity are well matched with the endorsed products (Kahle and Homer 1985; Kamins 1990; Kamins and Gupta 1994; Till and Busier 2000). In similar vein, McCracken suggests that a "celebrity who best represents the appropriate symbolic properties" of the product should be selected, thus highlighting the importance of the cultural meanings of the celebrities in the endorsement process. Celebrities embody a collection of culturally relevant images, symbols, and values. As images of the celebrities become associated with products through endorsement, the meanings they attach to the products are transferred to consumers through purchase and consumption (McCracken 1989, 316). Therefore, the practice of celebrity endorsement should be closely related to the cultural context in which the images of celebrities are formed and individual celebrities are selected to be linked with particular products. For advertising practitioners, employing an appropriate celebrity endorser to promote a product is important but a difficult task. For instance in the theoretical literature, professionals at advertising agencies and their client companies in the United States and the United Kingdom cited celebrity attributes such as image, trustworthiness, and familiarity, as well as the fit between the celebrity and the product, as important factors for choosing the appropriate endorsers (Erdogan, Baker, and Tagg 2001: Miciak and Shanklin 1994). Other highly ranked decision factors include celebrity/target-audience congruence, costs of securing the celebrity, the celebrity's risk of controversy, and the celebrity's prior endorsement. As suggested by Erdogan, Baker and Tagg (2011), the perceived importance and the actual use of endorser selection criteria may vary from culture to culture. Differences in the entertainment industry and agency business, and more broadly, in the cultural environments are likely to influence the execution of the celebrity endorsement strategy across countries. Arguing for standardized advertising across countries, some contend that consumer demands and tastes have become similar on a global scale (Levitt 1983; Taylor and Johnson 2002) and that using celebrities with worldwide recognition in advertising is an effective means of overcoming cultural difficulties (Erdogan 1999, Kaikati 1987; La Ferla 2001). Others claim that despite some observed convergence among consumers around the world, fundamental values still remain divergent across cultures. Therefore, international advertisers cannot assume that the same advertising technique should be uniformly applied or that it will be equally effective in different counties (De Mooji 1998, 2003; Onkvisit and Shaw 1999). Yet research on similarities and differences between cultures in the use of celebrity endorsement in advertising is scarce, despite the potential cultural influence on this technique as speculated in the literature.Questions:1.

                            5. ACTIVITY IV. Read and analyze the following literature review very carefully. Then,
complete the table that follows.
Kram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature
over time, providing different levels of mentoring functions as they progress
through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation,
and redefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin
initial interactions that involve learning the other’s personal style and work habits.
He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized by
musings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and
visibility, the mentor embodies as fantasized role model with whom the protégé
begins to identify and develops positive expectations about career
development. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then
progresses to the cultivation phase, in which career development, role modeling
and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram
(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and
protégé deepens and intimacy increases during this phase. This phase may last
from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentor
promotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor,
and the mentor gains loyalty and support of the protégé and feelings that his or
her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the
cultivation phase. The third phase, separation, involves a structural and
psychological disconnection between the mentor and the protégé when
functions provided by the mentor decrease, and the protégé becomes
independent. In the redefinition phase, the mentor and protégé frequently
develop a relationship that is more peer-like, characterized by mutual support
and informal contact. While career and psychosocial functions are less evident,
sponsorship from a distance, occasional counseling and coaching and ongoing
friendship continue. Hay (1995) believes that mentoring process is underpinned by
the following principles: recognizing that people are okay, realizing that people
can change and want to grow, understanding how people learn, recognizing
individual differences, empowering through personal and professional
development, developing competence, encouraging collaboration not
competition, encouraging scholarship and a sense of inquiry, searching for new
ideas, theories and knowledge and reflecting on past experiences as key to
understanding.
According to Mackimm, et al (2003) mentoring relationship is a special
relationship where two people make real connection. It is a protected
relationship in which learning and experimentation occur through analysis,
examination, reexamination and reflection on practice, situations, problems,
mistakes and successes (of both the mentors and the mentees) to identify
learning opportunities and gaps. According to Yang (2006), mentoring
relationships range from loosely defined, informal collegial associations in which
a mentee learns by observation and example to structured formal agreements
between expert and novice co-mentors where each develops professionally
through the two-way transfer of experience and perspective. Whether the
relationship is formal or informal, the goal of mentoring is to provide career
advice as well as both professional and personal enrichment. It is important that
the mentor and the mentee have a clear grasp of the mentoring process for
maximum benefits of this special relationship. For mentoring to be effective, the
mentee together with the mentor needs to reflect on the experiences in school
and attempts to understand the experience through analysis and
conceptualization. The individual makes choices based on analyzing the
implications. She/he identifies options, decides on what to do next and
undergoes another experience.
Mentoring relationship is classified as formal or informal, and short term or long
term (Goodyear, 2006). Formal mentoring is usually mandatory and
institutionalized by the school or agency. The meetings are determined,
monitored and evaluated based on clearly articulated goals and milestones.
Informal mentoring relationship is more spontaneous and springs from the
mentee’s intrinsic desire to become better. The choice of the mentor is based on
trust and confidence. Another type of mentoring is the duration of the
relationship which can be short term and long term. A short term mentoring
usually addresses a set of specific needs. Long term mentoring is based on the
broad based goals incorporated in the professional development career of the
institution or agency. Whether the mentoring relationship is formal or informal,
short term or long term, literature proves that mentoring has improved the
teacher’s personal artistry and professional skill in the workplace.
