Alan loves to read books. Sometimes, he imagines himself as one of the
characters from the book he reads. One night, while he was in his room, he heard
a loud bang from the room next door. It was his mini- library.
He jumped out of bed and checked the room. When he opened the door, a
blinding light came out. After a while, he noticed that he was already in a
different place. Books were flying. There were also flying horses and dragons.
Humans lived peacefully together with ancient beasts. All the things he read from
the books came to life.
“Welcome to, Realtasia. Would you like to have some tour?” a talking
cat approached Alan. He happily followed. They walked around the place and Alan
was amazed by its beauty.
The cat, named Ali, then, guided Alan to the woods where he saw a gigantic
tree, as tall as a mountain. Its leaves looked like pages of books, and its branches
looked like the skeleton of books. Alan realized that it was the tree that gave life
to Realtasia and without it the world would be gone.</a>

                            23. To make a deeper understanding of the concept, write a paragraph that compares a movie and a book about the same topic. In your paper, you can compare and contrast the movie version with the book version. As a suggestion, you may utilize watt pad stories,​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Whenever your essay topic involves comparison, you can organize in either of two ways. First, you can write about each thing separately and then include a section in which you make comparisons and contrasts between them. With this organization, you would first write about the strengths and weakness of the book, and then about the movie. In a third section you would make a series of statements comparing and contrasting major aspects of them both. If you choose this approach, make your separate discussions of the book and movie parallel — that is, for the movie, address the same points in the same order you used for the book. Also, in the third section of the paper, avoid simply repeating what you said in sections one and two. This approach can be especially effective if the book and movie are drastically different from each other.</p><p>A second way of organizing requires you to decide first which aspects of the book and movie you want to compare and contrast (setting, character development, tone, and so on) and then structure your paper around those points. For example, if you use setting, you would have one section of your paper to describe the setting in both the book and the movie and to compare them. Next you compare the character development in both versions, then the tone, then the imagery, and so on. Two advantages of this type of organization are, first, you are forced to focus on specific similarities and differences and less likely to include material that isn't important, and, second, you avoid repetition by ditching the separate compare-and-contrast section.</p><p></p><p>You can also combine these two types of organization. For example, you may want to discuss the overall plot structure of the movie and the book separately, and then move into a point-by-point comparison of the other aspects of the two versions (characters, setting, tone, and so on).</p><p></p><br />

                            30. Alan loves to read books. Sometimes, he imagines himself as one
of the characters from the book he reads. One night, while he was in his
room, he heard a loud bang from the room next door. It was his minilibrary.
He jumped out of bed and checked the room. When he opened the
door, a blinding light came out. After a while, he noticed that he was
already in a different place. Books were flying. There were also flying
horses and dragons. Humans lived peacefully together with ancient
beasts. All the things he read from the books came to life.
“Welcome to, Realtasia. Would you like to have some tour?” a
talking cat approached Alan. He happily followed. They walked around the
place and Alan was amazed by its beauty.
The cat, named Ali, then, guided Alan to the woods where he saw a
gigantic tree, as tall as a mountain. Its leaves looked like pages of books,
and its branches looked like the skeleton of books. Alan realized that it
was the tree that gave life to Realtasia and without it the world would be gone
