Although, there was no formal education, early Filipinos already had their own government system. Daily experiences and religious rites and ceremonies mostly reflect the type of literature produced at that time. Experts state the possibility of having our ancestors' own system of writing during the pre-colonial period but unfortunately only few survived in terms of written form leading to the prevalence of oral literature. This explains why no notable authors were recorded. RECREATEion: In this 21st century era where gadgets and internet have invaded the eople's daily lives, it is quite unimaginable to stay at home especially during this pandemic to keep oneself entertained without the use of mobile phones (or other gadgets) and internet. Think of life during the pre-colonial period and complete this diagram to show the list of activities you imagine doing at home from 6am to 9pm without technology.

Fill in the diagram with details correctly synthesizing the essential information, "Hospitality is a trait displayed by every Filipino, characterized by heart warming generosity and friendliness exhibited to foreigners and locals alike, Filipinos receive guests, even strangers, in a warm and pleasant way, often going out of their way to make the visitor comfortable. It is a trait not confined to the upper class and can be found among the poorest members of society. Even today, when guests arrive in Filipino homes during mealtime, they are offered whatever is being served for that meal. Most of the time, a new meal is prepared to the liking of the visitor. The Filipino hospitality is best exemplified in regard to foreign guests, who are treated with the utmost respect. Filipinos enjoy the company of foreign visitors, and most foreigners who have visited the country can testify to the warmth and friendliness of the locals. Excerpt quoted from: Why Are Filipinos Known to Be Hospitable?  "What makes Filipinos different from many other nationalities is that they openly welcome you to become a part of them. Filipino hospitality is hospitality not only to Filipinos, but to everyone, including non-Filipinos. Perhaps it's because they have been colonized by Spain and subsequently the United States, so they are used to having foreigners around. However, what's amazing is that Filipinos are excited and proud to show you what it means to be Filipino and welcome you to partake in the Filipino culture as if it were your own. Unlike other cultures where foreigners have a difficult time integrating, many foreigners who visit the Philippines "feel at home."

Both cultures have an agriculture-based economy. Poverty and corruption are rampant in both societies. Basic infrastructure is lacking in both cultures.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Comparison contrast African and Filipino cultures:</p><p><strong>Most countries in Africa have a black-brown color of their inhabitants. But countries where the Sahara has people who are lighter in color. </strong>For Asia, you will usually be tanned, or tanned, but it depends on the country</p><p>Culture.<strong> Note that there is diversity on both continents, Asia and Africa. All cultures have different cultures, because of logic. </strong>Climate. If you ask me about the climate of an entire continent, it actually varies, depending on the country you are in. However, since Africa is not too low to reach Antarctica, the average temperature of all countries will not reach below 0 degrees Celsius. On the other hand, the Saharan countries that are above the equator will experience slightly cooler temperatures than the Sub-Saharan countries.</p><p>The country with the largest number of Catholics in Asia. <strong>Filipinos have a habit of expressing their happiness by dancing and singing</strong>. Whereas in Africa, religion in Africa is mostly composed of Christianity and Islam. However, this religious diversity cannot be separated from traditional <strong>African religious practices related to folk religious traditions or syncretism which is also ultimately practiced in Christians or Muslims.</strong></p><p>Differences between cultures, is not a new thing. Since the dawn of civilization, when humans first formed tribal groups, intercultural relations occurred whenever people from one tribe met members of another tribe and discovered that they were different. <strong>Basically, humans create their culture or social environment as an adaptation to their physical and biological environment. </strong>Subsequent generations are conditioned to accept these truths about the life around them, certain taboos and values are established and through many ways people accept explanations of acceptable behavior for living in that society. Culture affects and is influenced by every phase of human activity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more about culture</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/29479338</p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

They reciprocate kindess with kindess, generousity with gnerousity. </p><p></p><p>4. Respect - Filipinos embody the value of respect. It can be seen in their gestures and in their words (po at opo).</p><p></p><p>5. Caring to their elders - Unlike Western people, we don't send our elders in the home for the aged. We take care of them instead.

Crab mentality - we often don't feel happy over the success of others.</p><p></p><p>2. Colonial mentality - Something that is of foreign origin is better.

                            30.  ASSESSMENT Directions: Read the two excerpts about Filipino hospitality. Fill in the diagram with details correctly synthesizing the essential information, "Hospitality is a trait displayed by every Filipino, characterized by heart warming generosity and friendliness exhibited to foreigners and locals alike, Filipinos receive guests, even strangers, in a warm and pleasant way, often going out of their way to make the visitor comfortable. It is a trait not confined to the upper class and can be found among the poorest members of society. Even today, when guests arrive in Filipino homes during mealtime, they are offered whatever is being served for that meal. Most of the time, a new meal is prepared to the liking of the visitor. The Filipino hospitality is best exemplified in regard to foreign guests, who are treated with the utmost respect. Filipinos enjoy the company of foreign visitors, and most foreigners who have visited the country can testify to the warmth and friendliness of the locals. Excerpt quoted from: Why Are Filipinos Known to Be Hospitable?  "What makes Filipinos different from many other nationalities is that they openly welcome you to become a part of them. Filipino hospitality is hospitality not only to Filipinos, but to everyone, including non-Filipinos. Perhaps it's because they have been colonized by Spain and subsequently the United States, so they are used to having foreigners around. However, what's amazing is that Filipinos are excited and proud to show you what it means to be Filipino and welcome you to partake in the Filipino culture as if it were your own. Unlike other cultures where foreigners have a difficult time integrating, many foreigners who visit the Philippines "feel at home."
