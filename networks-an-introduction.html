                                            Importance of the Human Heart The heart is a muscular organ about the size of a fist, located just behind and slightly left of the breastbone. The heart pumps blood through the network of arteries and veins called the cardiovascular system. The heart has four chambers: The right atrium receives blood from the veins and pumps it to the right ventricle. The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs, where it is loaded with oxygen. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the left ventri- cle, The left ventricle (the strongest chamber) pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. The left ventricle's vigorous contractions create our blood pressure. The heart is important because it pumps blood around your body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to your cells and removing waste products. There are valves between the atria and ventricles that make sure blood flows in one direction through your heart. INTRODUCTION BODY CONCLUSION​</a>

                            25. Importance of the Human Heart The heart is a muscular organ about the size of a fist, located just behind and slightly left of the breastbone. The heart pumps blood through the network of arteries and veins called the cardiovascular system. The heart has four chambers: The right atrium receives blood from the veins and pumps it to the right ventricle. The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs, where it is loaded with oxygen. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the left ventri- cle, The left ventricle (the strongest chamber) pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. The left ventricle's vigorous contractions create our blood pressure. The heart is important because it pumps blood around your body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to your cells and removing waste products. There are valves between the atria and ventricles that make sure blood flows in one direction through your heart. INTRODUCTION BODY CONCLUSION​</h2><br />
