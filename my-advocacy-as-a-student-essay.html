                            1. My advocacy as a student​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>My advocacy as a student​</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Be a Student Advocate: Top 9 Tips</p><p></p><p>Thanks to its partnership with publisher Eye on Education, EducationWorld is pleased to present this administrator advice from The Principal as Student Advocate: A Guide for Doing What's Best for All Students by M. Scott Norton, Larry K. Kelly, and Anna R. Battle. This article provides the top nine traits that a principal needs in order to become an effective student advocate.</p><p></p><p>The principal student advocate possesses several special traits that ground his or her personal administrative philosophy:</p><p></p><p>    Is student centered. He or she is a principal who is committed to helping each student be his or her best, one whose beliefs relative to student advocacy are revealed in his or her actual behaviors and decisions about school policies, curriculum and related school programs.</p><p>    Makes decisions that are in the best interests of students. The principal understands the complexity of the factors that affect the performance and success of a student and supports and defends decisions that are in the best interests of all students.</p><p>    Represents the special needs of all students. This trait encompasses academic, social and physical needs. Student advocacy focuses on identifying students’ educational needs and then taking proactive steps to gain maximum support for meeting those needs through educational policy and state and federal laws. Proactive measures often are met with resistance and criticism. Unpopular actions on the part of the student advocate may be viewed by colleagues and others as permissive, or as attempts to gain popularity with students. It takes courage to stand up for students and the principles of advocacy when others favor policies that are more popular with other parties.</p><p>    Sees things from the student’s perspective. The student-advocate principal always keeps in mind what is best for the individual student. This trait will be reflected in his or her philosophy relative to such matters as student discipline.</p><p>    Stands up for student rights and concerns. The student-advocate principal treats students as important individuals in their own right and recognizes their individual needs. This trait requires that the principal be knowledgeable of the rights of students and the administrator’s responsibilities under state and federal laws. The principal takes courageous stands on educational initiatives that are contrary to the best interests of students.</p><p>    Creates an environment in which students can focus on their interests and strengths. This advocacy trait requires attention to the inclusiveness of the school’s programs, such that the curriculum and instructional methods support individualism. Principals are committed to the statement, “I will respect my students.” The principal accepts each student, regardless of his or her status, for the personal contribution that he or she can make to the success of the school’s goals and objectives and to his or her own growth and development. The advocate leader uses his or her influence and energy to protect students’ rights and interests.</p><p>    Views the school as an inclusive learning site. Each student is given the opportunity to participate in the school’s programs and learn, in the continuous effort to reach his or her potential.</p><p>    Is a good listener. The principal student advocate is genuinely interested in assisting a student in meeting his or her personal needs and interests. Listening to the student’s side of the story, learning about the student’s special interests and talents, knowing students by name, and using effective listening skills are of paramount importance to student advocates. The principal makes an effort to see things from the student’s perspective and is sensitive to the student’s feelings.</p><p>    Has a research posture. The principal student advocate is a consumer, distributor and utilizer of the best research relative to such critical issues as student retention, student motivation, special needs programs, student learning and others. The principal’s philosophy relative to such matters rests on a fact-based approach supported by quality research and generally accepted best practices.</p><p></p><p>i just searched it but i hope it helps you...,,,</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong> </strong><strong>things</strong></p><p>1.    Eliminate Waste from Lunches</p><p></p><p>ELIMINATE! Tired of seeing some piece of plastic and paper around the campus? What a waste?! Why not pack some veggies and fruits in a lunch box instead of buying in convenience stores? Isn’t it healthier that way? Buying bottled water and cold drinks? Why not try bringing your own mug or tumbler? That way, we can save money; we can be healthier, and; we can help the environment.</p><p></p><p>2.    Stop Littering</p><p></p><p>STOP! Trash cans or trash bins are all around the campus. It is not that difficult to throw your candy wrapper in one of them, right? If there are no trash bins available, why not keep it first in your bag and throw it afterwards?</p><p></p><p>3.    Reduce Paper Consumption</p><p></p><p>Papers, papers, papers! Done with the paperwork? Don’t throw your notes away! You can use it for re-printing an essay or article or even for some artwork! This won’t bite. Trust us!</p><p></p><p>4.    Save Electricity</p><p></p><p>OFF! Turn off the lights if not in use. Unplug your electronics if not in use. Turn off the air conditioning units if it’s not needed. Just turn them off and unplug them, will you? You know how it works.</p><p></p><p>5.    Save Water</p><p></p><p>DO NOT overuse water. Use it if needed. Got some used water? Water the plants with it. Plants have unique filtration capabilities to recycle water and turn it into its own food. Know that process? Yeah, partner it with carbon dioxide and sunlight and you’ll get photosynthesis, which by-products will give you clean water and fresh air.</p><p></p><p>6.    Swap Regular School Supplies</p><p></p><p>FOR AN ECO FRIENDLY ONE! If our school supplies are not used anymore, why not try to donate it to the needy instead of throwing it right away? You’ll not just help the environment, but also the youth and the society.</p><p></p><p>7.    Bring Reusable Bags to the Grocery Store</p><p></p><p>PLASTIC AGAIN! If you’re going to buy something in any store, why not try using reusable bags instead of buying plastic? In that way, you can help lessen pollution and waste in our nation! Invest in Eco-bags!</p><p></p><p>8.    Walk to School or Take a Bike, Avoid Taking Cars or Carpool When Possible</p><p></p><p>TOO MUCH POLLUTION, LET’S BEAT IT!

                        My preparation for this assignment began with a review of the Healthy People initiative that was developed by the Department of Health and Human Services. There are many ongoing health issues that our healthcare system is currently dealing with. The Healthy People initiative is a set of goals and objectives designed to guide national health promotion and disease prevention to improve the health of all people in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). The population health issue I’ve chosen for my policy developing campaign is HIV stigma reduction. In this assignment I will illustrate the significant impact of the stigma towards the population infected with HIV/AIDS and suggest a potential advocacy campaign…<br />At the time of the discovery of HIV globally, the overwhelming majority of infected individuals were homosexual men, intravenous drug users, and others that engaged in promiscuous or unprotected sexual activities. Shortly following the initial discovery of the virus, many more documented cases of the disease began to surface in the United States. “U. S. epidemiologists had documented the mysterious symptoms in heroin users, heterosexuals, newborns, people with hemophilia, and people who had received blood transfusions” (Poindexter, 2007, p. 6). As this newly documented disease made more and more persons dangerously ill, medical professionals found it began to be accompanied by an intensely isolating stigma. This HIV related stigma resulted in cruel discrimination toward infected individuals that lead to poor health outcomes, noncompliance with therapy, increased levels of depression and stress. Severe symptoms of HIV/AIDS began to appear sooner than expected which lead to poorer health and lower quality of life for infected individuals. The stigma and discrimination became a monumental issue for those found to be HIV positive, especially when compounded by the existing comorbidities in which they had to contend.<br />
