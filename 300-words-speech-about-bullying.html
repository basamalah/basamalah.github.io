                        Bullying is an issue that has been affecting many in the world today. It takes place in many forms some of which are direct and include physical harm on the victim. Verbal bullying involves name calling and insults or threats being directed at the victim and may also involve emotional bullying where the victim’s emotions are targeted by the bully. Other forms of bullying may be indirect where the harm is not caused by the person directly but it still ends up affecting the person.<br /><br />Bullying is termed as a form of abuse that uses power and dominance to those that are weaker and less powerful. Bullying has been taking place in various areas but it is mostly common in schools and workplaces. It exists in various social groups, social classes and is found all over the world. The behavior is usually repetitive and aggressive and it is based on the sole intention of hurting the victim. Bullies carry out the behavior to harm the other person as a way of gaining power over the other person. It is normally a behavior that is planned and purposeful.<br /><br />Bullying in schools has become very common and it has led to some very serious consequences. It has led to physical violence in forms of fight and in some extreme cases deaths by suicides. Cases have emerged of some forms of bullying in the schools that have led to some of these severe consequences. Children who are victims have had to live with short term and long term consequences of the behavior. Some of the other effects include poor performance in their studies, depression, bedwetting, being withdrawn, changing schools regularly and is some cases suicides among others (Norfolk, n.d).  Over 7% of children especially in the 8th grade tend to stay at home once a month since they are bullied in schools (Banks, 1997). Reports have also shown that about 15% of students are bullied on a regular basis with some being initiated into the bullying practice. Direct bullying is more common among boys than with the girls. However, physical abuse in boys tends to reduce as they progress in age. The victims of bullying sometimes carry these effects such as depression and low self-esteem into their adulthood.<br /><br />Bullying is a serious problem that is affecting the academic and social lives of the school going children. In order to understand the problem and develop an intervention plan that can be used to stop it, it is important to identify the various forms of bullying that are going on within the schools and the trends they are taking. It is also important to understand how they have carried out and the effects that arise from the practice. This will help develop a plan that will be able to establish a safe and secure environment in the schools for all children.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying is a big problem for children and young people that go through it. It knocks their self-esteem and makes them lose their confidence, and can make them dread going to school each day. In extreme cases, young people can become suicidal as a result of bullying, while in other very serious cases, it can get out of hand and lead to the bully murdering their victim. It’s also a huge problem for parents and teachers, because stopping bullying is a hard task and they often don’t know the best ways to go about it. There are three key elements to stopping bullying educating the bullies, imposing greater sanctions for the bullies, and protecting the victim.</p><p><strong>Explanation: You have to think why bullying is bad and why it should be stopped i do not think bullying is good</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        Bullying is any behavior that is initiated by one or more students against a victim or victims that causes physical or psychological intimidation. Bullying behaviors can be classified as either direct (such as teasing, threatening, hitting, or stealing) or indirect (such as rumor spreading or social isolation). Boys typically employed direct methods of bullying, while girls tend to use in direct methods. Either way, behaviors must occur repeatedly overtime to be classified as bullying.<br />

                        <p>When schools fail to protect our kids from bullying, Public Justice uses litigation to:</p><p>• Seek justice for bullying victims and their families;</p><p>• Effect systemic change within school districts through injunctive relief requiring improved policies and procedures, as well as training and education programs for school administrators, teachers, students, and others in the school community; and</p><p>• Develop good federal and state case law to better protect bullying victims.</p><p>We believe litigation is a critical tool in helping to solve school bullying. It can motivate school officials to insist that bullying is confronted rather than ignored, put teeth into school policies and procedures, require training programs, and teach tolerance. In short, it can help create systemic change in the culture of school districts, so they do a better job of preventing bullying in the first place and responding appropriately when bullying does occur.</p><p>Public Justice handles a wide range of anti-bullying cases. We take on all forms of discriminatory harassment, including bullying based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, ethnicity, disability, or religion. Our sex discrimination cases include sexual and gender-based violence against students. We also handle bullying cases that don’t fit neatly into any of these categories. In addition to litigating in the courts, we represent bullying victims and sexual assault survivors in administrative complaints filed with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights.</p><br />

                        <p>I would start with some examples of individuals destroyed, driven to suicide by cyber bullying. Go straight into it; “Sally was an honors student in medicine, highly praised for her intellect and loved by her friends and family. Great things were expected of her. She might one day cure cancer… But she never will. She is dead. Cyber bullying killed her…”
</p><p>
</p><p>Don’t drag them on too long, because the idea is to pepper the audience with quick examples so they understand the issue is not with what happened to one or a few people, but that this is endemic and happens frequently. List three or four such examples, citing something that personalizes the individual to create empathy (similar to what I wrote above), the sort of attacks they were subject to using adjectives for accent, and finally the horror that resulted.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then mention statistics to show how these are not isolated incidents. Use voice inflection and dramatic pauses for emphases.
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally delve into a personal story of how it has affected you or someone close to you. This need not and likely should not be one of suicide (unless someone close to you ‘has’ been pushed that far). The emphases in this should be the emotional pain. Do what you need to do for the audience to fully appreciate the depth of it. Belabor the lasting effect this has had on you and/or your friends.
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point, your audience should be primed to hear whatever you have to say about how to address the problem. They may not agree with your proposed solutions, but they almost certainly will agree with the need that it be addressed.</p><br />

                        A clear definition of bullying and a policy that disallows it and lays out the consequences is one means to arm a school or school district against this problem. For one thing, when bullying is clearly defined, then it can be more easily recognized and separated from constructive criticism, discipline, and motivation, all of which are bordering areas. It is important that the policy be clear and research-based in order to not be so broad that students and teachers are fearful of being perceived as bullies at every turn when what they say is not praise. And it is different, though still potentially painful, if a child is picked last for games because he or she has an objectively poor skill set as opposed to being picked last due to an explicit campaign to ostracize him or her.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In my words bullying is a form of harassment, verbal and physical.</p><p>Sometimes leading to self doubt, depression and suicide as the bullying</p><p>continues. Bullies use hurtful words and actions on purpose to discourage others.</p><p>Anyone can get bullied, even adults and anyone can be a bully. In some cases,</p><p>the bullies are stressed or angry and don't know how to express it. Making</p><p>someone else suffer with them. In my point of view, insults are considered</p><p>bullying. Even the little things hurt a lot. It's hard to understand what the bully is</p><p>going though, we all just assume that they are disrespectful. When most of the</p><p>time, they were hurting too.</p><p>An example of bullying was when my friend got shamed because of her</p><p>body size. I didn't know about it until later on. I know it has happened multiple</p><p>times and I have witnessed it. I'm not proud of being a bystander, being honest I</p><p>was scared of standing up and getting bullied myself. We don't always recognize</p><p>bullying, sometimes it's unnoticeable and other times it's right in front of us. It's</p><p>challenging to get over words that come out of anyone's mouth, frequently you go</p><p>days with thinking about it. My friend was hurt, I could tell. It's hard fixing</p><p>someone's thoughts about them self, once something is said to make them think</p><p>it.</p><p>We can't stop all bullying, but we can prevent it from happening so often.</p><p>Like I said, most of the time bullies just need someone to talk to. It's anger kept</p><p>inside for so long they need someone to express that anger out on.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying has been a common practice on colleges, where the seniors assault the juniors to show them their power, and the privileges of being seniors. Generally, bullying is done by the strong people on the weaker sections of people.</p><p></p><p>These people appear to be strong based on their power (both physical and intellectual) and position. These people bully the weaker people for mainly two reasons; to make their presence felt or to make them do some unpleasant work.</p><p>Bullying is not only common in colleges but also schools, offices and other places. A person who is bullied regularly or has been bullied before, suffer huge mental trauma and physical trauma. Some people lose their mental and physical steadiness due to these bullies.Some people even lose their confidence after getting bullied, either temporarily or permanently. In both cases, that person should be treated by a proper therapist or consultant because mental trauma may not appear to be as serious as physical trauma. Still, the mental condition of that person will make him lead a life according to his choices that he is going to take.</p><p></p><p>If the person who is bullying other people succeeds in doing so, then he will get confident and continue bullying people. In that case, a bully should be reported immediately, and the person who is bullying should be immediately punished with proper punishments so that he does not repeat the same thing.</p><p></p><p>There are many clubs or organizations in schools and colleges that ensure that the students are safe from bullying. They strictly instructed the students that they should inform the authorities of the organizations if there is any case of bullying or ragging seen on the premises.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>i hope it can help! thank uu</p><br />

                        <p></p><p>Bullying in kindergarten, elementary and secondary education is not a new phenomenon. While schools are expected to be a safe haven for our children, they can still be pervaded by bullying. Bullying is a reality that has been with us for as long we can remember. Others ignore it to consequently avoid being the object of bullying. It is also undeniably present in colleges, universities, workplaces, and organizations.</p><p>To most, bullying is improper or ill conduct —a result of an attitudinal problem. However, when the bully starts to instill fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to property of another student. creates a hostile environment for the victim, or substantially disrupts the education process or orderly operation of the school, then the bully must be subject to disciplinary measures (Section 3(b), Rule II, Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 10627).</p><p>It is interesting to note that the word “bully” was used five hundred years ago as a term of endearment; derived from the Dutch word “boel” for brother, or the German “buhle” for lover. The meaning of “bully” later evolved to define someone who is a bluster or harasser of the weak, and today describes a person who abuses another</p><br />
