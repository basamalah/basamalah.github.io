                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2. A lot of women nowadays have so much more freedom than before, for example, they can play sports, be a president/prime minister, learn, win a noble prize, vote, they can be who they want to be and it's all because of Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone and Ida B. Wells they were the ones who protested on women's right to vote, Hélène de Pourtalès was the first ever woman to compete in the Olympics, and so many other women fought for each and every woman's life, we probably wouldn’t be here and live freely without these women. </p><p>3. </p><p>To me everyone has their own opinions on true crime, either it's because they want to know why those people commit such awful crimes, why these murders/crimes happen and how people go missing. Us humans always have the urge to know why, how, when, where or whatever happened because it sparks up our curiosity.
