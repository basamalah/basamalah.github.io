                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Impact of Global Health Issues and Concerns to Me as an Adolescent</p><p></p><p>As an adolescent, global health issues and concerns have a significant impact on my life. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has disrupted my daily routine and limited my social interactions. I have had to adjust to remote learning and limit my exposure to others to prevent the spread of the virus. While these measures are necessary for public health, they have also had a negative impact on my mental health and wellbeing.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, other global health issues and concerns also affect me as an adolescent. Climate change, for example, has the potential to affect my future and that of future generations. The impact of climate change, such as rising sea levels, natural disasters, and food shortages, can have a significant impact on my quality of life and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Another global health issue that concerns me is the prevalence of mental health problems among young people. Depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems are becoming increasingly common among adolescents, and the lack of access to mental health services can make it difficult to receive the support and treatment needed.</p><p></p><p>Overall, global health issues and concerns have a significant impact on my life as an adolescent. They affect my physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing, as well as my future prospects. It is important for individuals, communities, and governments to work together to address these issues and create a safer, healthier, and more sustainable world for all. This can involve taking steps such as reducing carbon emissions, increasing access to mental health services, and promoting public health measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. By working together, we can make a positive impact on global health and create a better future for ourselves and future generations.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa mark nalang ako ng brainliest</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Challenges and burden of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for child and adolescent mental health: a narrative review to highlight clinical and research needs in the acute phase and the long return to normality </p><p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is profoundly affecting life around the globe. Isolation, contact restrictions and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment in affected countries. These measures have the potential to threaten the mental health of children and adolescents significantly. Even though the current crisis can bring with it opportunities for personal growth and family cohesion, disadvantages may outweigh these benefits. Anxiety, lack of peer contact and reduced opportunities for stress regulation are main concerns. Another main threat is an increased risk for parental mental illness, domestic violence and child maltreatment. Especially for children and adolescents with special needs or disadvantages, such as disabilities, trauma experiences, already existing mental health problems, migrant background and low socioeconomic status, this may be a particularly challenging time. To maintain regular and emergency child and adolescent psychiatric treatment during the pandemic is a major challenge but is necessary for limiting long-term consequences for the mental health of children and adolescents. Urgent research questions comprise understanding the mental health effects of social distancing and economic pressure, identifying risk and resilience factors, and preventing long-term consequences, including—but not restricted to—child maltreatment. The efficacy of telepsychiatry is another highly relevant issue is to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and perfect its applications to child and adolescent psychiatry.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>There are numerous mental health threats associated with the current pandemic and subsequent restrictions. Child and adolescent psychiatrists must ensure continuity of care during all phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-associated mental health risks will disproportionately hit children and adolescents who are already disadvantaged and marginalized. Research is needed to assess the implications of policies enacted to contain the pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents, and to estimate the risk/benefit ratio of measures such as home schooling, in order to be better prepared for future developments.</p><p></p><p>Background</p><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is profoundly affecting lives around the globe. Isolation, contact restrictions and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment of affected countries. The current situation affects children, adolescents and their families in an exceptional way. Kindergartens and schools have been closed, social contacts strongly limited and out-of-home leisure time activities canceled. Parents are asked to support their children with home schooling, while at the same time working from home. External support by other family members and social support systems have fallen away.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ate ito po</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As fake news became rampant, journal articles plays a significant role. Specifically, it serves as a reliable source on a certain topic. According to Social Weather Stations (SWS) Seven out of 10 adult Filipinos believe the problem of fake news and its spread on the internet is serious. This encompasses 32 percent of respondents who believe fake news in media like television, radio, and newspaper was “very serious,” 38 percent said it was “somewhat serious,” 6 percent said it was “somewhat not serious” and 3 percent think it was “not serious at all.” Meanwhile, 21 percent were undecided. People should use reliable sources to avoid misinformation and be vigilant about any articles they read. The survey made only was an indication that many Filipinos don't make time to research or gather reliable information on a certain topic. This is very alarming because the knowledge of our future generations is at risk. This can be resolved if reliable sources like journal articles would be encouraged to use as a main source of information especially on the current issues globally.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Author's viewpoint is the way an author looks at a topic or the ideas being described. Viewpoint includes the content and the language used to present the data. Thoughtful readers decipher an author's point of view, opinions, hypotheses, assumptions, and possible bias. A thesis statement is the basic stand that an author takes, the opinion that he expresses, and the major point that he wishes to make about his subject. It contains the controlling idea of the essay, and therefore, gives the direction and the unity to all the separate elements of the writing.<p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Sorry yan lang po alam ko ehh</p><p></p><br />

                            30. imagine a world without global health issues (essay)​</h2><br />
                        If the world did not have to face the problems of global health issues, I think our technology and capabilities can massively improved as a society. One issue that has always hindered countries to progress and become a more developed country is poverty. One of the many reasons people fall into poverty is because of health issues. They may not be able to pay the required amount for hospital bills and so they integrate into poverty. With the ongoing Covid-19, this virus has greatly impacted our world economically, politically, educationally, and personally. This virus has exacerbated the issue of poverty since now the people in poverty are suffering not only financially, but also physically because of the virus. If this virus were never to be summoned, I believe our world would be in a fantastic place right now. <br />
