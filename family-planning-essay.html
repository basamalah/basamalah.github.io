                        ABORTION<p></p>Are you in favor of using contraceptives and abortion as means of family planning?<p></p>ANSWER<p></p>For me, it's a <strong>yes</strong>. Thinking about the situation of our country right now, it is indeed hard to get a job for your family to survive in. Having intercourse with our partners in times of pandemic especially when the majority are ordered to stay home, is normal and can't be prevented. The result of this intercourse causes another charge in money for anyone. So yes, I'm in favor, this is to reduce the population in our country who's living in an impoverished family. They usually get sick and can't be guided by their parents because of a lack of money. This is <strong>for the sake of those people who are not ready for the responsibility of gaining another baby.</strong> But, take note that I'm not enticing everyone to do this. Before doing this "thing", it's better to be married first and get a suitable job. It's still a life of a baby that is at risk, it's only for those who are not yet ready to raise a baby.<p></p><p>#BrainliestChallenge2021</p><br />

In conclusion, the world’s population will continue to grow as long as birth rate exceeds death rate. As far as resources are concerned, it is apparent that the era of cheap energy, adequate amounts of food, and necessary open spaces is coming to an end. Regardless of whether we admit it or not, our attempts to stabilize population, or our failure to do so, will have a devastating affect on our lives, and our home: Mother Earth.</p><br />

Note: I will mark you Brainliest if your answer is Outstanding</h2><br />
                        Family planning is arguably one of the most important public health concerns in our country. It is defined as a woman’s ability to decide if and when to have children, and a lot of us are still concerned with the contradicting factors each country has encountered. And as a part of the growing community, I have been a firm believer that this is as important as any social concerns we are experiencing especially since the relevance will be greatly affecting our future generations.<br /><br />The primary purpose of family planning is to guide and help us control the number of unwanted pregnancies and achieve any ideal number of family members of every household. Although the word "control" might have a negative connotation to it, a more positive outcome will be the effect of learning and accepting this concept. Once achieved, we can progressively help our own country in resolving other socio-economic concerns such as poverty, lack of education, domestic abuse, and overpopulation. Aside from these, we will also be able to slowly prevent the stigma of marriage for the sake of having a complete family due to unwanted pregnancies. Undergoing counseling, access to contraception, and access to safe abortion will protect our fellow Filipinos from being locked in a situation due to a circumstance that can be prevented.<br /><br />Surely, there is a number of benefit from this concept, however, a lot of cons are lined up as well. Specifically, with our country, this is very contradicting topic between the church and the government. Some of it is evidently the opposite of what the church has taught us and it will be harder for everyone to support such a contrary concept of life. And hopefully, a more conducive option will be developed to compensate both principles of our society.<br />

                            27. Write an essay entitled “My Future Family”. Include in your essay how you want to plan your future family or what are the things that you will take into consideration to have a happy and healthy family. You will be scored using the rubric below.</h2><br />
                        I want my future family to have similar aspects of my current family, such as loving my children as much as my mom does, along with aspects of Gil’s family, like how even when he was stressed, he still stayed and cared for his family. Even as a child, I have always thought I would be a fun mother, and I hope to have a family somewhat of the likes of Gil’s. His children had fun, and, although he was stressed out often times, he found a way to still make time for what matters most: being with his family. I know it will be a little hard to obtain this goal, but I will try my very best to make a loving family who will go out on a limb for you. I believe a family should do anything for you when you need them most and I will shape my children into people I would want to be friends with. In order for me to try to keep qualities like my family now, I would need to work with the parenting styles my parents have shown me through the years.Hope it helps! Correct me if im wrong, Hoping for Brainliest (Not Forcing) :D<br />
