                                            The Crow and the Sparrow
Once upon a time, a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day, they
were hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out
on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers”, said crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see
who can eat the most, and if I am going to win, I’m going to eat you”, the
sparrow laughed and agreed for the thought that the crow was joking. The
sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated.
“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” Then at last, the sparrow realized
that the crow was serious. “all right,”, he said. “I’ll keep my promise but before
you eat me, you must wash your beak, for everyone knows that you are a dirty
bird and eat a lot of nasty things.”
So, the crow went to the river and asked water to wash his beak, the
river agreed but the crow must get a pot to put it in. Then, the crow went to
the village to get a pot but the potter told the crow to look for clay to make a
pot. The crow went to the field and began digging up clay with his beak, but
the earth refused unless the crow will use a spade. The crow went to the village
blacksmith and asked to make him a spade, but the blacksmith replied if he
wants a spade, he must bring the blacksmith a fire.
Finally, the crow went to the farmer’s house. The farmer’s wife was
cooking rice in the country yard and the crow asked her to give him a fire,
and the farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and his feathers burnt
into flame

                                            The Crow and the SparrowOnce upon a time a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day when they were Hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers,” said the crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see who can eat the Most.” “All right!” answered the sparrow. “Then the one who wins will eat the other,” said the crow. The sparrow laughed and agreed for he thought the crow was joking. Friends do Not eat each other. The sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated. For each Pepper that he ate, he hid three more under the mat without the sparrow’s seeing.“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” said the crow. Then at last the sparrow realized that the crow was serious. “All right,” he said, “I’ll keep my promise. But before you eat me you must wash Your beak for everyone knows that you’re a dirty bird and eat lots of nasty things.” So the crow went to the river and cried. “River! River!Give me water To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The river replied: “You want water? Very well, but everyone says you eat nasty Things. If you want to wash your beak in my water, you must get a pot to put it in and then You can have as much water as you like.”The crow went to the potter in the village and cried: “Potter! Potter! Make me a pot To fetch some water. To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The potter replied: “You want a pot? Very well, but I have no clay. Bring me some clay and “I’ll make you a pot.”The crow went to a field and began digging up clay with his beak. The earth said: “The whole world knows that you eat rubbish and nasty things. I cannot allow you to dig Up my clay unless you use a spade.”The crow went to the village blacksmith, who was working on a wheel. The crow Said to him: “Blacksmith! Blacksmith! Make me a spadeTo dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak,To make myself neat,The sparrow to eat!” The blacksmith replied: “You want a spade? Very well, but you see I have no fire In the forge. If you want me to make a spade, you must bring me some fire.”The crow went to a farmer’s house nearby. The farmer’s wife was cooking rice in The courtyard. The crow cried:“Dear farmer’s wife! Give me fire To make a spade To dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The farmer’s wife replied: “You want fire? Very well, but how will you carry it?” “You can put it on my back,” said the crow.The farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and immediately his feathers burst Into flames. The greedy crow was burnt to ashes. But the honest sparrow lived to a ripe Old age.​</a>

                            6. The Crow and the Sparrow
Once upon a time, a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day, they
were hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out
on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers”, said crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see
who can eat the most, and if I am going to win, I’m going to eat you”, the
sparrow laughed and agreed for the thought that the crow was joking. The
sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated.
“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” Then at last, the sparrow realized
that the crow was serious. “all right,”, he said. “I’ll keep my promise but before
you eat me, you must wash your beak, for everyone knows that you are a dirty
bird and eat a lot of nasty things.”
So, the crow went to the river and asked water to wash his beak, the
river agreed but the crow must get a pot to put it in. Then, the crow went to
the village to get a pot but the potter told the crow to look for clay to make a
pot. The crow went to the field and began digging up clay with his beak, but
the earth refused unless the crow will use a spade. The crow went to the village
blacksmith and asked to make him a spade, but the blacksmith replied if he
wants a spade, he must bring the blacksmith a fire.
Finally, the crow went to the farmer’s house. The farmer’s wife was
cooking rice in the country yard and the crow asked her to give him a fire,
and the farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and his feathers burnt
into flame

                        The story the Crow and the Sparrow is a story about Kaakamma the crow that lived in a mudhouse and Gubbamma the sparrow who lived in a brick house. <br /><br />The lesson that you can get from the story is that you should be grateful for the deeds that someone has given you. If you will be ungrateful, you may suffer a consequence in the end. The crow had a taste of his own medicine when he tried to eat the little sparrows of Gubbamma. Luckily, the wooden toy of her little ones saved their life. With kaakamma's ungratefulness, he was thrown outside and had to spend the whole night out in the cold, getting wet in the rain.<br /><br />

The sparrow laughed and agreed for he thought the crow was joking. Friends do Not eat each other. The sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated. For each Pepper that he ate, he hid three more under the mat without the sparrow’s seeing.“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” said the crow. Then at last the sparrow realized that the crow was serious. “All right,” he said, “I’ll keep my promise. But before you eat me you must wash Your beak for everyone knows that you’re a dirty bird and eat lots of nasty things.” So the crow went to the river and cried. “River! River!Give me water To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The river replied: “You want water? Very well, but everyone says you eat nasty Things. If you want to wash your beak in my water, you must get a pot to put it in and then You can have as much water as you like.”The crow went to the potter in the village and cried: “Potter! Potter! Make me a pot To fetch some water. To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The potter replied: “You want a pot? Very well, but I have no clay. Bring me some clay and “I’ll make you a pot.”The crow went to a field and began digging up clay with his beak. The earth said: “The whole world knows that you eat rubbish and nasty things. I cannot allow you to dig Up my clay unless you use a spade.”The crow went to the village blacksmith, who was working on a wheel. The crow Said to him: “Blacksmith! Blacksmith! Make me a spadeTo dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak,To make myself neat,The sparrow to eat!” The blacksmith replied: “You want a spade? Very well, but you see I have no fire In the forge. If you want me to make a spade, you must bring me some fire.”The crow went to a farmer’s house nearby. The farmer’s wife was cooking rice in The courtyard. The crow cried:“Dear farmer’s wife! Give me fire To make a spade To dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The farmer’s wife replied: “You want fire? Very well, but how will you carry it?” “You can put it on my back,” said the crow.The farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and immediately his feathers burst Into flames. The greedy crow was burnt to ashes. But the honest sparrow lived to a ripe Old age.​</h2><br />
