Imagined Community
An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his
1983 book Imagined Communities, to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts
a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who
perceive themselves as part of that group
The media also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass
audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that
the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The
media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By
showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the
most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible
because of "print capitalism". Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and
media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in
order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects
became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged.
Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around
their "national print-languages." Anderson presented that the first form of
capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The
process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after the moment when the
books printed in script languages, such as Latin saturated the elite market and also,
in the moment it was observed that just a small category of people were speaking it
and were part of the bilingual society. It is also important to remember that this
start of cultural and national revolution started around 1517 when Martin Luther
presented his views regarding the scripture texts and how population and people
should be able to read it in the comfort of their own homes and then in the
following years, between 1520-1540, more than a half of the books that where
printed in German translation had his name on. Moreover, the first European
nation-states that are presented to have formed around their "national print-
languages" are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England and
around todays Germany. Should also be taken in consideration the fact that not
only in the Western Europe this process of creating a nation was emerging, in a
few centuries most of the Europe nations had created their own national languages,
but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German, mostly the last
two, for political affairs.
Nationalism and imagined communities
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of
nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and
hereditary monarchy and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the
convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national
calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily
newspapers")—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial
Revolution. From this Anderson argues that in the presence and development of
technology people started to make differences between what means divine and
divinity and what really is history and politics, because initially the divine and the
history of society and politics was based on the existence of a common religion
that was a unification umbrella for all the people across Europe. With the
emergence of the printing press and also capitalism, people gained some sort of
national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people
together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation
print-languages that were spoken by each individual. That helped the development
of the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art,
novels, publications, mass-media, and communications.
While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective
antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
(2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and]
(3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and
even incoherence."
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The
tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but
each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No
matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed
them within their imagined community.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Diko po gets ung tanong</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Long Mode:</p><p>1. Yes, it is because social groups provide requirements to the needy people. In this way, the satisfaction of needs is the binding force among the individuals and unites them into social group. Society has divided people into different groups according to their needs and interests. 'These groups have reciprocal role in society.</p><p>2. Yes because socialization helps in the process of personality formation. Even if human personality is the result of our genes, the socialization process can mold it. Our social class, race and gender affect how we are socialized.</p><p>3. Individual behavior and decision making can be influenced by the presence of others. ... However, the influence of groups on the individual can also generate negative behaviors. While there are many ways a group can influence behavior, we will focus on three key phenomena: groupthink, groupshift, and deindividuation.</p><p>4. My knowledge and understanding of culture, society, and politics can help me think critically about our current situation by having the right mindset. It can help me understand the situations that we are facing and why we are facing them in the first place. We need a way of thinking that can help us come up with better decisions to improve the quality of our culture, society, and politics.</p><p>5. Simply put, ethnocentrism is defined as “judging other groups from the perspective of one's own cultural point of view.” Cultural relativism, on the other hand, is defined as “the view that all beliefs are equally valid and that truth itself is relative, depending on the situation, environment, and individual.”</p><p></p><p>Hope i helped but if you can...Please brainliest me.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> Put simply, the social sciences are important because they create better institutions and systems that affect people’s lives every day. Creating frameworks for understanding the origins and effects of regime type, the purpose of political parties, the reasons for polarization, the structure of social networks, the goals and structures of government agencies, or the challenges and opportunities faced by service providers and nonprofits are all attempts to make sense of structures that have real and profound on-the-ground impacts. While many social science disciplines are important in helping people to understand and engage with the wide variety of institutions that shape their lives, political science is particularly valuable in helping people learn to be citizens. Through participating in government at all levels, holding lawmakers accountable, and upholding democratic norms and values, individuals must have the resources to understand how government works and how laws and regulations are made; evaluate policies and outcomes based on effectiveness and values; make informed decisions about policy preferences; and, especially, understand the importance of participating in government, from voting to protesting. Political scientists are essential in providing these resources, in classrooms and in the public sphere.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong> </strong>Understanding Culture, Society, and Politics  uses multidisciplinal insights from anthropology, political science, and sociology to develop student awareness of cultural, social, and political dynamics and sensitivity to cultural diversity. It provides a deeper understanding of how culture, human agency, society, and politics work; and engage students in the examination of the country’s current human development goals. At the end of the course, students should acquire ideas about human cultures, human agency, society, and politics; recognize cultural relativism and social inclusiveness to overcome prejudices; and develop social and cultural competence to guide their interactions with groups, communities, networks, and institutions.</p><p></p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong> </strong>Put simply, the social sciences are important because they create better institutions and systems that affect people's lives every day. ... Thus, social sciences help people understand how to interact with the social world—how to influence policy, develop networks, increase government accountability, and promote democracy. </p><p></p><p><strong>4.</strong> The importance of understanding culture is that it helps you understand different cultures not just Filipino cultures but also other cultures. ... And understanding politics to helps you know one of the basic rights you have. It also tells you on what is happening on our government.</p><p></p><p><strong>5.</strong><strong> </strong>I’d make my own world into a world without violence or badness. A world where people can only feel happy. A world that looks brand new and designed as if it were the future. Making your world would only be possible if you could control people. If you could control them then they wouldn’t have free will and the place would just end up a reflection of your ego. It would become soliptic. </p><br />

Imagined Community
An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his
1983 book Imagined Communities, to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts
a nation as a socially constructed community, imagined by the people who
perceive themselves as part of that group
The media also creates imagined communities, through usually targeting a mass
audience or generalizing and addressing citizens as the public. Another way that
the media can create imagined communities is through the use of images. The
media can perpetuate stereotypes through certain images and vernacular. By
showing certain images, the audience will choose which image they relate to the
most, furthering the relationship to that imagined community.
According to Anderson, creation of imagined communities became possible
because of "print capitalism". Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and
media in the vernacular (instead of exclusive script languages, such as Latin) in
order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects
became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged.
Anderson argued that the first European nation-states were thus formed around
their "national print-languages." Anderson presented that the first form of
capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The
process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after the moment when the
books printed in script languages, such as Latin saturated the elite market and also,
in the moment it was observed that just a small category of people were speaking it
and were part of the bilingual society. It is also important to remember that this
start of cultural and national revolution started around 1517 when Martin Luther
presented his views regarding the scripture texts and how population and people
should be able to read it in the comfort of their own homes and then in the
following years, between 1520-1540, more than a half of the books that where
printed in German translation had his name on. Moreover, the first European
nation-states that are presented to have formed around their "national print-
languages" are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England and
around todays Germany. Should also be taken in consideration the fact that not
only in the Western Europe this process of creating a nation was emerging, in a
few centuries most of the Europe nations had created their own national languages,
but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German, mostly the last
two, for political affairs.
Nationalism and imagined communities
According to Anderson's theory of imagined communities, the main causes of
nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and
hereditary monarchy and the emergence of printing press capitalism ("the
convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national
calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily
newspapers")—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial
Revolution. From this Anderson argues that in the presence and development of
technology people started to make differences between what means divine and
divinity and what really is history and politics, because initially the divine and the
history of society and politics was based on the existence of a common religion
that was a unification umbrella for all the people across Europe. With the
emergence of the printing press and also capitalism, people gained some sort of
national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people
together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation
print-languages that were spoken by each individual. That helped the development
of the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art,
novels, publications, mass-media, and communications.
While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
"(1) The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eyes vs. their subjective
antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
(2) The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [and]
(3) the 'political' power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and
even incoherence."
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The
tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but
each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No
matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed
