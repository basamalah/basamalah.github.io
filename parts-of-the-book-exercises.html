The Importance of Forests Our forests are among our country's important natural resources. We depend on them our timber products. They provide raw materials for houses and furniture, buildings, railroads, and ships. They provide the pulp for our books and newspapers and the fiber for our clothing. Most of our food and medicine also come from them. Our forests help preserve and protect the soil on which our crops are grown. If there are no trees on hillsides and sloping lands, the soil can easily be eroded by rainwater. Then, its fertile part is washed away. Our forests also provide good homes for animals and birds. Our bird friends make their nests on the branches of the trees. Some animals live and sleep in the hollows of big trees and feed on leaves and fruits. Sentence Outline: Title: 1. А. B. с D II. А. В.

                                            3. Certain people consciously or unconsciously cherish the desire that some part of their work and of their accomplishment will outlive their own individual life. The influence which they have exercised on the world in which they lived, the concern which they have built up, the books which they have written, the work they have laid as a part of some scientific edifice, whose completion they themselves will not live to see all such things inspire the people that some aspect of themselves will outlast their own personal existence, the artist bequeaths his pictures, the scholar his contribution of knowledge while poets and composers are primarily concerned that posterity shall take pleasure in their creations. Statesmen envisage that particular agreement in whose development they themselves had played a crucial part will preserve their names for future generations. People are not unconcerned for their posthumous reputation. Many an old person is distinctly preoccupied with this question and keeps a zealous watch to ensure that his achievement are properly quoted and recorded. pa precis po​</a>

The Importance of Forests Our forests are among our country's important natural resources. We depend on them our timber products. They provide raw materials for houses and furniture, buildings, railroads, and ships. They provide the pulp for our books and newspapers and the fiber for our clothing. Most of our food and medicine also come from them. Our forests help preserve and protect the soil on which our crops are grown. If there are no trees on hillsides and sloping lands, the soil can easily be eroded by rainwater. Then, its fertile part is washed away. Our forests also provide good homes for animals and birds. Our bird friends make their nests on the branches of the trees. Some animals live and sleep in the hollows of big trees and feed on leaves and fruits. Sentence Outline: Title: 1. А. B. с D II. А. В.

                            23. 3. Certain people consciously or unconsciously cherish the desire that some part of their work and of their accomplishment will outlive their own individual life. The influence which they have exercised on the world in which they lived, the concern which they have built up, the books which they have written, the work they have laid as a part of some scientific edifice, whose completion they themselves will not live to see all such things inspire the people that some aspect of themselves will outlast their own personal existence, the artist bequeaths his pictures, the scholar his contribution of knowledge while poets and composers are primarily concerned that posterity shall take pleasure in their creations. Statesmen envisage that particular agreement in whose development they themselves had played a crucial part will preserve their names for future generations. People are not unconcerned for their posthumous reputation. Many an old person is distinctly preoccupied with this question and keeps a zealous watch to ensure that his achievement are properly quoted and recorded. pa precis po​</h2><br />
