SITUATION: "At the rate our people are bombarded with all sorts of Western pop and commercial music through radio, television, jukeboxes, record players, and movies-the day may not be too far away when we shall have committed our own native music to the grave; harshly forgotten, abandoned, its beauty laid to waste by an unknowing generation whose only fault is not having been given the chance to cultivate a love of it..."-Felipe Padilla de Leon Our young people hear almost nothing of the creative music of the people of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The vast output of our serious composers, who ironically are mostly Manila-based, is also unknown to them. There is a pressing need to bring Philippine music closer to our people: strong identification of our own music is one vital factor in bringing our people together or unifying the nation. Exposing Filipinos to their own musical traditions is properly the task of the government, our music educators, musicologists, community leaders, concerned media practitioners, performing groups, pro-Filipino radio and television stations and recording companies, heritage centers and libraries, and cultural organizations all over the country, As a student, you are given the task to perform music of Luzon by choosing one of the following activities listed below that you think you can do alone with confidence. 1. Sing a folk song from your region or province. You are going to sing a folk song from your region or province. The performance can be a capella (unaccompanied) or with accompaniment (live or minus 1). Record your performance in your gadget (cellphone or computer) if possible. Send your performance to your MAPEH teacher. (Online/Digital) 2.
