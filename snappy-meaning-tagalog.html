                                            A year ago, Jessica’s whole world turned upside down. Her grades started slipping and she wanted to sleep all the time. Jessica kept feeling worse and worse. Her younger brother, Matt, was upset too. He could not focus during his basketball games. He was forgetful and snappy towards his friends.Jessica knew that she had to deal with the problems she was having. First, she identified the cause of her stress. Jessica realized that her problems began when her parents divorced. She talked to her parents about how she felt, and they went to see a family counselor together. Jessica said she was feeling angry and upset. The counselor told her that her feelings were normal. She also beganhaving more discussions with Matt so that they could share how they were feeling. Jessica found that talking about the divorce made it easier to deal with. She also felt that talking with her brother made their relationship stronger. She became better able to adjust to the changes in her life.QUESTION:1. What is the relationship between Jessica's condition in school performance and her parents' family problems?2. Who are the supportive group that help her manage her mental and emotional health?</a>

                                            Apo on the wall by bj patino
There’s this man’s photo on the wall
Of my father’s office at home, you
Know, where father brings his work,
Where he doesn’t look strange
Still wearing his green uniform
And colored breast plates, where,
To prove that he works hard, he
Also brought a photo of his boss
Whom he calls Apo, so Apo could
You know, hang around on the wall
Behind him and look over his shoulders
To make sure he’s snappy and all.
Father snapped at me once, caught me
Sneaking around his office at home
Looking at the stuff on his wall- handguns,
Plaques, a sword, medals a rifle-
Told me that was no place for a boy
Only men, when he didn’t really
Have to tell me because, you know,
That photo of Apo on the wall was already
Looking at me around,
His eyes following me like he was
That scary Jesus in the hallway, saying
I know what you’re doing.
Question:
what kind of values does the persona's father want to teach his child, specifically, about what it means to be a man? Do you agree with this values? Why or why not?</a>

The poem tells the reality of life during the reigning of Marcos alongside with the Martial Law. It is a reflection of the scenario of what and how the Filipinos experienced the tragic and traumatic event throughout the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines. “Apo on the wall” shows the real situation concerning with the different perspective between millennial and those who lived through Martial law. This masterpiece of Bj Patino advocates reasonably close to the realization of giving importance on looking back to our past, moving forward through our present and ensuring the success of our future.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Guide Questions</p><p></p><p></p><p>1) How would you describe the persona and the persona's father? How would describe their relationship? Would you say that your relationship with your father is similar or different? Explain.</p><p></p><p>                    The persona is a child that is curious about the picture of Apo on the wall. His father is strict and works for the government (he's a soldier). Their relationship is like a boss and employee because the persona needs to follow what his father wants in order for his father to become happy. our relationship with my father is similar but it's just that my father is not strict.</p><p></p><p>2) In lines 12-13 in the poem, there is the use of the words “snappy” and “snapped”, respectively. What do these words mean? How do they add to the poem in terms of sound? How do they add to your understanding of the relationship between the father and the son?</p><p></p><p></p><p>           Snappy means to be able to move quickly while being marked by vigor. On the other hand, snapped means to utter sharp biting words. These other words add to the poems sound by providing words that seem to be sounding similar. They aid me to understand that the father was rigorous even to his son by being particular about following the rules.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            26. Apo on the wall by bj patino
There’s this man’s photo on the wall
Of my father’s office at home, you
Know, where father brings his work,
Where he doesn’t look strange
Still wearing his green uniform
And colored breast plates, where,
To prove that he works hard, he
Also brought a photo of his boss
Whom he calls Apo, so Apo could
You know, hang around on the wall
Behind him and look over his shoulders
To make sure he’s snappy and all.
Father snapped at me once, caught me
Sneaking around his office at home
Looking at the stuff on his wall- handguns,
Plaques, a sword, medals a rifle-
Told me that was no place for a boy
Only men, when he didn’t really
Have to tell me because, you know,
That photo of Apo on the wall was already
Looking at me around,
His eyes following me like he was
That scary Jesus in the hallway, saying
I know what you’re doing.
Question:
what kind of values does the persona's father want to teach his child, specifically, about what it means to be a man? Do you agree with this values? Why or why not?</h2><br />
                        <p>The persona's father wants to teach his child about the values of hard work, responsibility, and obedience to authority. He displays symbols of his own hard work and dedication to his job, such as his uniform, breast plates, and photo of his boss, to emphasize these values. The father also uses the image of his boss, Apo, to reinforce the idea that his work is being monitored and that he must be diligent and "snappy" in his duties.</p><p></p><p>Whether one agrees with these values depends on individual perspectives and beliefs. On one hand, values such as hard work and responsibility are generally regarded as positive traits and can lead to personal and professional success. On the other hand, obedience to authority can be seen as a negative value if it results in blindly following orders or suppressing one's own thoughts and opinions.</p><p></p><p>It's also worth considering the context in which these values are being taught. In the poem, the father uses fear to enforce obedience, with the image of Apo on the wall appearing to "follow" the child and "scare" him into doing what is expected of him. This kind of authoritarian approach to child-rearing may not be seen as healthy or appropriate by everyone.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the values the father wants to teach his child in the poem are a mix of positive and potentially negative traits, and whether one agrees with these values is subjective and depends on individual perspectives.</p><br />

Apo3 on the Wall by Bj Patino </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Apo on the Wall by: Bj Patino:</strong></p>The persona can be described as an inquisitive child and his father could possibly be a strict dad. Their relationship is most likely to be very casual since a child with a strict father would most likely be reserved and quiet at his father's presence. My relationship with my father is not similar with them because I am very close to my dad because he is very cool and loving.The word snappy in line 12 of the poem could mean neat or clever while snapped on line 13 might mean sanctioned or disciplined. These words mean something related to discipline and being strict. Reading these two terms in the poem makes it easier to understand that the poem sounds so serious and that the relationship between the father and son is so casual.Apo in the poem is former president Ferdinand Marcos as seen on the photo hanging on the wall. However, what makes the poem remarkable is the child's perception of Apo. He compares Apo to Jesus that knows what one is doing. That is how he look at Apo or Ferdinand Marcos during his day. He seem to him like God who knows everything.<p><strong>Keywords: </strong>Apo, father, son</p><p>Apo on the Wall: <strong>https://brainly.ph/question/496263</strong></p><p><strong>#BetterWithBrainly</strong></p><br />
