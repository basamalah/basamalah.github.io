</p><p>
</p><p>Sampling Methods
</p><p>
</p><p>Sampling methods are the ways on selecting members from the population to be in the study. Researchers select samples rather than working with the overall population because most of the times, population involved in the study is large and it is impossible for them to gather the needed data for every object in the study. There are five ways to select a sample and they are as follows:
</p><p>
</p><p>Random Sampling
</p><p>In this method, everyone in the population has an equal chance to be chosen. It is like everyone's name is in a box and researchers draw out several names.
</p><p>
</p><p>Systematic Sampling
</p><p>In systematic, the list of elements in the study is "counted off". Meaning the members of the population are put in order and every nth member is selected to be in the sample.
</p><p>
</p><p>Convenience Sampling
</p><p>The readily available sample is used in the study. Researchers poll people as they walk by on the street.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sfratified Sampling
</p><p>For stratified, the population is split into groups, then from each group samples are selected.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cluster Sampling
</p><p>In this method, population is also split into groups. The difference from stratified is that samples in cluster consist of every member of the selected groups.
