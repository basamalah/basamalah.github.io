They have so much to talk about the new film, the new dress, homework, the boys in the class and just about everything. Yesterday, Rose seemed uncomfortable. She was having her periods and was concerned about staining her uniform. Rose recollected that 3 months ago, Jane, Marie and Juliet had started her periods. Rose is worried. Except her, all her friends had started their periods. Was something wrong with her? Questions: 1 if rose came to you for a adivce ,what would you tell her as a peer?? 2 in your opinion, who should be responsible for sensitizing adolescents about the fact that it is natural for different people to attain maturity at different times? 3 Do you think it is important for young people to be prepared for the changes that they are likely to face in adolescence? why? ​</a>

                                            The Story of Mariang SinukuanOnce upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and Sinukuan used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to see at their doorstep's fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was Mariang Sinukuan who left these foods And to show their gratitude and respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people considered her home as a sacred place. But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted to get more. One day, some young men decided to go up mt. Arayat. They wanted to get more of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. They started for the mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise. Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big ruits they bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one's reach. Fowls of every kind were plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were still viewing this wonder of nature vhen from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan. They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not End any words to say to her. It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them." Welcome to my ome, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as you can but I'm warning you not to ake anything home without my knowledge.” With this, the enchanted lady departed.After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits. They ate and ate until they could not eat any more. "Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which brought," said one. "No, let's not do that. Let's go home now," said another. "I'm scared." " Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?" But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge." "Oh, come on. She won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference." And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn't mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They remenbered Mariang Sinukuan's warning. The young men became terribly frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry them. But before they reached the base of the mountain, who did they see blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry. "You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me. You are inot satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I'm going to turn you all into a swine." With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men into swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. Again, and again they tried to steal them. At last, ed up with the people's greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She aused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. She no longer showed herself to e people for she was disgusted with their greediness.1. If you were Mariang Sinukuan, would you give them the same punishment?2. What are the values can we get or learn from the story of mariang sinukuan? ​pahelp po pls ng maayos na sagot ty. </a>

The Story of Maria Sinukuan
Once upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit
trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed
this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit
trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and the animals was no
other than Mariang Sinukuan. These fruit trees and animals, Mariang Sinukuan
used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to
see at their doorsteps fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was
Mariang Sinukuan who left this foods while they were sleeping. How grateful the
people were to be graced by the enchanted lady. And to show their gratitude and
respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people
considered her home as a sacred place.
But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no
longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted
to get more.
One day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat. They wanted to
get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They started for the
mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise.
Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate
branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big fruits they
bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one’s reach. Fowls of every kind were
plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were
still viewing this wonder of nature when from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan.
They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not find any words to say to her.
It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them.
” Welcome to my home, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as
you can but I’m warning you not to take anything home without my knowledge.”
With this, the enchanted lady departed.
After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits.
They ate and ate until they could not eat any more.
“Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which I brought,” said one.
“No, let’s not do that. Let’s go home now,” said another. “I’m scared.”
” Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?”
” But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge.”
“Oh, come on. She won’t know we took home fruits and animals. They’re so
plentiful, she won’t know the difference.”
And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and
animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were
about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn’t
mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load
was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men
were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They
remembered Mariang Sinukuan’s warning. The young men became terribly
frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry
them. But before they reached the base of the mountain whom did they see
blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry.
“You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me.
You are not satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even
try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I’m going to turn you all into a
swine.” With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men
into swine.
This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang
Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Again and again they tried to steal them. At last,
fed up with the people’s greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at
their doorsteps. She caused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to
disappear. She no longer showed herself to the people for she was disgusted
with their greediness.</a>

She was having her periods and was concerned about staining her uniform. Rose recollected that 3 months ago, Jane, Marie and Juliet had started her periods. Rose is worried. Except her, all her friends had started their periods. Was something wrong with her?

Just because you're period came a bit late that doesn't mean you are less than me or other girls.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I'm sorry to hear about James Parke's traumatic experience. No one should ever have to face such violence and abuse, especially for simply being themselves. Homophobic attacks are a serious issue and can have long-lasting effects on the victim's physical and mental health.</p><p>It's important that James receives the medical attention he needs to recover from his injuries, and that he receives support from his family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time. Additionally, it's essential that the perpetrators of this attack are brought to justice and held accountable for their actions.</p><p>As a trainee police officer, James likely has a unique perspective on the issue of hate crime and the challenges that law enforcement faces in addressing it. It's important that we work together as a society to combat hate and discrimination in all its forms, and to create a world where everyone feels safe and accepted for who they are.</p><p></p><br />

                            12. The Story of Mariang SinukuanOnce upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and Sinukuan used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to see at their doorstep's fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was Mariang Sinukuan who left these foods And to show their gratitude and respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people considered her home as a sacred place. But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted to get more. One day, some young men decided to go up mt. Arayat. They wanted to get more of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. They started for the mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise. Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big ruits they bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one's reach. Fowls of every kind were plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were still viewing this wonder of nature vhen from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan. They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not End any words to say to her. It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them." Welcome to my ome, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as you can but I'm warning you not to ake anything home without my knowledge.” With this, the enchanted lady departed.After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits. They ate and ate until they could not eat any more. "Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which brought," said one. "No, let's not do that. Let's go home now," said another. "I'm scared." " Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?" But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge." "Oh, come on. She won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference." And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn't mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They remenbered Mariang Sinukuan's warning. The young men became terribly frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry them. But before they reached the base of the mountain, who did they see blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry. "You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me. You are inot satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I'm going to turn you all into a swine." With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men into swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. Again, and again they tried to steal them. At last, ed up with the people's greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She aused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. She no longer showed herself to e people for she was disgusted with their greediness.1.

The Story of Maria Sinukuan
Once upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit
trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed
this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit
trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and the animals was no
other than Mariang Sinukuan. These fruit trees and animals, Mariang Sinukuan
used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to
see at their doorsteps fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was
Mariang Sinukuan who left this foods while they were sleeping. How grateful the
people were to be graced by the enchanted lady. And to show their gratitude and
respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people
considered her home as a sacred place.
But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no
longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted
to get more.
One day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat. They wanted to
get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They started for the
mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise.
Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate
branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big fruits they
bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one’s reach. Fowls of every kind were
plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were
still viewing this wonder of nature when from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan.
They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not find any words to say to her.
It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them.
” Welcome to my home, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as
you can but I’m warning you not to take anything home without my knowledge.”
With this, the enchanted lady departed.
After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits.
They ate and ate until they could not eat any more.
“Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which I brought,” said one.
“No, let’s not do that. Let’s go home now,” said another. “I’m scared.”
” Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?”
” But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge.”
“Oh, come on. She won’t know we took home fruits and animals. They’re so
plentiful, she won’t know the difference.”
And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and
animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were
about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn’t
mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load
was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men
were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They
remembered Mariang Sinukuan’s warning. The young men became terribly
frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry
them. But before they reached the base of the mountain whom did they see
blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry.
“You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me.
You are not satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even
try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I’m going to turn you all into a
swine.” With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men
into swine.
This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang
Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Again and again they tried to steal them. At last,
fed up with the people’s greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at
their doorsteps. She caused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to
disappear. She no longer showed herself to the people for she was disgusted
with their greediness.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>        Once upon a time there was a girl named Mariang Sinukuan. She lived in Mt. Arayat that abounded in all kinds of fruit and trees and all kinds of animals roamed around there. Mariang Sinukuan helps the peolple there by giving fruits and animals and that gains their respect for her. But one day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat to get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Mariang Sinukuan saw them and told them to eat as much as they can but don't take anything home without her knowledge but they did not obey her instead they fill their sacks with fruits and animals making Mariang Sinukuan angry and punish by turning them into a swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They tried to steal them and because of that she stopped leaving food at</p><p>their doorsteps. And eventually hide herself together with the fruit and animals from the people for she was disgusted with their greediness.</p><br />
