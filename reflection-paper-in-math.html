HEALING OBJECTIVE LEARNING OBJECTIVE Develop self-awareness, self-expression, self-understanding, empathy Practice math and language, fine motor, and visual-spatial skills DIRECTIONS Review the guidelines for your PSS session: be curious, be respectful, listen, take turns, avoid judgment, everything shared is confidential. Ask learners if they have ever felt more than one feeling at once. Share with them that this is normal, especially in the time of COVID-19. To deal with hard feelings, tell them that it's helpful to stop from ' time to time, and try to understand which are the different feelings they are experiencing 1 On a sheet of paper, ask learners to think of the different feelings they have at this moment. Ask them to take a sheet of paper and divide it in half. On the left side, ask them to write down all the feelings they feel in the moment and assign a color for each.​​</a>

Sets can be observed around us and without knowing it, we are actually using it. For your differentiated activities you can draw, list or create a song, a poem or a dance that shows the SET of precautionary measures that your family use during COVID pandemic. 2.

In this time of pandemic, have you counted your blessings? Reflect how blessed you are despite the problems that we are facing and list all your finite and infinite blessings that come into your life. Happy counting! 3. Problem solving helps us to become analytical and critical thinkers not only in Mathematics but also in real life situation. As you enter the teenage chapter of your life, it is unavoidable to encounter lot of challenges along the way. In a form of art or writing, express your thoughts or insights on how you face your problems. 4.Integers is a set of numbers that consists of negative, zero and positive.
