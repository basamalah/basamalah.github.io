                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. THE SIX CLASSIFICATIONS OF DRUGS OF ABUSEPrepared by: Daniel M. Alcazarin Science Teacher I Talangan Integrated National High School</p><p>2. A drug, is any substance that, when absorbed into the body of a living organism, alters normal bodily function. Drugs are chemicals that change the way a person's body works by altering emotions and thoughts. DRUGS – WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO ?</p><p>3. Drugs Drugs Abuse Drugs Dependence (Addiction) Drug abuse is an intense desire to obtain increasing amounts of a particular substance. Drug dependence is the body's physical need, or addiction, to a specific agent. Over the long term, this dependence results in physical harm and behavior problems which causes tolerance and cross tolerance. Thus, it creates a vicious cycle.</p><p>4. WHY DO SO MANY TEENAGERS START DOWN THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PATH ?</p><p>5. THE SIX CLASSIFICATIONS OF DRUGS OF ABUSE</p><p>6. 1. GATEWAY DRUGS •Are legal drugs that a non-drug user might try, which can lead him/her to more dangerous drugs such as marijuana and shabu. •Teenagers who engage in early smoking &amp; drinking have higher chance of using and experimenting with dangerous drugs of abuse.</p><p>7. 2. DEPRESSANT DRUGS • Slows down a persons central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, nerves). • Doctors commonly prescribe depressants to help people who have anger management issues, stressed or tensed. • Depressants relax muscles and nerves. • These drugs make patients feel sleepy and light headed. Examples are: alcohol, barbiturates &amp; tranquilizers.</p><p>8. A barbiturate is a drug that acts as a central nervous system depressant, and can therefore produce a wide spectrum of effects, from mild sedation to total anesthesia. They are also effective as anxiolytics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsants.</p><p>9. 3. STIMULANT DRUGS •Speed up a persons central nervous system. •Has the opposite effect of depressants. •Makes a person’s energy high •Side effects are depression and tiredness. Examples are amphetamines (shabu, caffeine, nicotine, cocaine)</p><p>10. •Amphetamine is a potent central nervous system stimulant that is used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), narcolepsy, and obesity.</p><p>11. •Methamphetamine (SHABU) is a strong central nervous system stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity.</p><p>12. •Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant of the methylxanthine class. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.</p><p>13. •Nicotine is a potent parasympathomimetic stimulant and an alkaloid found in the nightshade family of plants.</p><p>14. •Cocaine, also known as coke, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or as a solution injected into a vein.</p><p>15. 4. NARCOTICS •Are drugs which relieve pain and induce sleepiness. •These are prescribed to patients with mental disorders or with patients dealing with severe pain like cancer. •These drugs are illicit and dangerous if taken. • Examples are cocaine, heroin and marijuana.</p><p>16. •Heroin, also known as morphine among other names, is an opioid most commonly used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Medically it is used in several countries to relieve pain.</p><p>17. •Marijuana refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indicaplant. The plant contains the mind- altering chemical THC and other similar compounds. It is also called weed, herb, pot, grass, bud, ganja, Mary Jane, and a vast number of other slang terms.</p><p>18. 5. HALLUCINOGENS •Drugs which distort reality and facts. •Affects all senses; makes a user feel, hear, see things that don’t exist in the time being. •Came from the word hallucinate (to perceive illusions) • Examples are: Lysergic Acid diethylamide, psilocybin (obtained from mushrooms and mescaline</p><p>19. •Lysergic acid diethylamide, also known as acid, is a psychedelic drug known for its psychological effects.</p><p>20. •Psilocybin mushrooms, also known as psychedelic mushrooms, are a polyphyletic group of mushrooms that contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin, psilocin and baeocystin. Common colloquial terms include magic mushrooms and shrooms.</p><p>21. 6. INHALANTS • Found in ordinary household chemical products and anesthetics. • Readily available and accessible to young children • Inhalant toxins are similar to those of alcohol, the only difference is the foul smell. • Abuse can lead to delusions, brain damage, liver damage, comatose and death. • Examples are acetone, rugby (solvent), spray paints, cleaning fluids and air conditioner fluids (Freon).</p><p>22. • Examples are acetone, rugby (solvent), spray paints, cleaning fluids and air conditioner fluids (Freon).</p><p>23. 6 CLASSIFICATIONS OF DRUGS ARE: 1.Gateway Drugs 2.Depressant Drugs</p><br />
