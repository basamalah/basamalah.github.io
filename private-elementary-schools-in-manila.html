Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Without knowing the distribution of the number of students enrolled in private elementary schools, it is impossible to determine the exact probability of the number of students being between 545 and 585. However, assuming that the distribution is approximately normal with a mean of μ and a standard deviation of σ, we can use the standard normal distribution to estimate the probability.</p><p></p><p>Let's assume that the mean number of students enrolled in private elementary schools is μ = 565 and the standard deviation is σ = 30 (these are just hypothetical values for the purpose of this example).</p><p></p><p>To calculate the z-scores for the lower and upper limits, we use the formula:</p><p></p><p>z = (x - μ) / σ</p><p></p><p>For x = 545:</p><p></p><p>z = (545 - 565) / 30 = -2/3</p><p></p><p>For x = 585:</p><p></p><p>z = (585 - 565) / 30 = 2/3</p><p></p><p>Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we can find the probabilities associated with these z-scores:</p><p></p><p>P(z &lt; -2/3) = 0.2525</p><p></p><p>P(z &lt; 2/3) = 0.7475</p><p></p><p>The probability of the number of students being between 545 and 585 is the difference between these two probabilities:</p><p></p><p>P(545 ≤ x ≤ 585) = P(z &lt; 2/3) - P(z &lt; -2/3) = 0.7475 - 0.2525 = 0.495</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if the mean number of students enrolled in private elementary schools is 565 and the standard deviation is 30, the probability of the number of students being between 545 and 585 is approximately 0.495.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps po, pa brainlest na din po ty!</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Grading in education is the attempt to apply standardized measurements of varying levels of achievement in a course. Grades can be assigned as letters (for example, A through F), as a range (for example, 1 to 6), as a percentage, or as a number out of a possible total (for example, out of 100).[1]</p><p></p><p>In some countries, grades are averaged to create a grade point average (GPA). GPA is calculated by using the number of grade points a student earns in a given period of time.[2] GPAs are often calculated for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and can be used by potential employers or educational institutions to assess and compare applicants. A cumulative grade point average (CGPA), sometimes referred to as just GPA, is a measure of a student's performance for all of his or her courses.</p><p></p><br />

                            22. ACTIVITY: Using the Venn diagram, read and understand the news article about the 748 private schools that suspend their operations taken from two sources. Then, find the details with similar thoughts and their differences. NEWSPAPER: 748 private schools suspend operations By Janvic Mateo Hundreds of private elementary and high schools across the country will suspend operations this school year due to low enrollment of students, according to the Department of Education (DepEd). Data released this week by DepEd showed that 748 out of 14, 435 private schools nationwide have already given notice that they will not operate for school year 2020-2021. Most of those that will suspend operations are in Central Luzon with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila with 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspensions affect 3,233 teachers and 40,345 learners. DepEd reported that 329 are elementary schools, 18 are purely junior high school and 30 purely senior high school. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said low enrollment was the primary reason for not operating. He previously said that the cost of continuing operations under the blended learning setup was also a factor in the decision of some schools not to open this year. "(They are saying) that it would be temporary closure. But if the situation improves next year, they will reopen," he added. Face-to-face classes have been suspended for the rest of the year due to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted schools to adopt distance learning approaches, such as shifting to online or modular-based learning. Latest data showed that only 2.02 million students have so far enrolled in private schools, representing only 47.14 percent of the more than four million student population in private schools last year. More than 24.3 million elementary and high school students had expressed their intention to enroll in public and private schools this school year, representing 87.82 percent of the student population last year. Over 22.22 million signed up in public schools, while almost 400,000 students from private schools have transferred to public schools for the upcoming school year set to start Oct. 5. Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they are hopeful that the schools would reconsider their position, noting the improving economy that may push enrollment in the private sector.

ONLINE ARTICLE: 748 private schools suspend operation amid Covid-19 pandemic By Jasmine C. Posted on September 10, 2020 Metro Manila - Thousands of students and teachers across the country will be affected as hundreds of private elementary and high schools will be suspending its operation due to low enrollment of students. According to the data released by DepEd, 748 out of 14, 435 private schools across the country have sent their notice that they will temporarily suspend operations for the 2020-2021 school year. Schools in Central Luzon got the majority on the list with 141, followed by Calabarzon with 121, Metro Manila at 96 and Western Visayas with 90. The suspension will affect 40,345 and 3,233 teachers across the 329 elementary school with 18 junior high schools and 30 purely senior high schools. DepEd Undersecretary Jesus Mateo said that low enrollment was the main culprit of the temporary suspension of operation. He added that the continuing operations under different learning setup was also a factor of some of the school not to open for the upcoming school year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones, on the other hand, also attributed the temporary closure to lack of parent's income that leads to students of not enrolling for this school year. DepEd has allowed private schools to open its classes before October 5, provided that they will implement distance learning approach. Source: Jasmine C.
