Thank you. Abortion  Abortion is an act which intends to bring about the death of a fetus for the sake of the woman who carries it. The main argument against abortion is based on the right to life. Abortion is considered as plain murder of an innocent being; and for that it is deserves the gravest condemnation. Because of the unborn status of the subject of abortion, the controversy usually revolves around the debate whether the subject in the womb is already a person, or not; or to put it in another perspective, whether the subject inside the woman has life already, or not. Most pro-abortion arguments will argue for the acceptability of abortion because they do not recognize the fetus, or the embryo as constituting a human person who deserves the right to life. The basic argument thus runs: Every person has a right to life. The fetus is not yet a person. Therefore, the fetus does not have yet the right to life. An analogy may perhaps simplify this. A presidential candidate is a potential president; but she does not deserve the rights and privileges of an actual president until she wins the election. Similarly, a fetus who is a potential person, does not possess the right to life because it is not yet a person.  We have to see the important aspect of this pro-abortion argument-that is, killing a person is wrong. They only argue for the permissibility of abortion because they do not consider fetuses or embryos as persons. That is why most of the arguments are directed to the issue of determining when life is produced. As for the Vatican, abortion is a termination of life, and it is therefore wrong. The right to life must not be discriminating. The Vatican declares: "The right to life is no less to be respected in the small infant just born than in the mature person." In reality, respect for human life is called for from the time that the process of generation begins.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion has been legal in the United States since 1973 (MacKinnon,2018). Despite the legality, both pro-lifers and pro-choice advocates have stood on opposite ends of the issue. Those who are passionate about either side have valid points to the moral issue at hand. What this really boils down to is who has more rights-the women who wants to decide for herself when she wants to reproduce or the unborn fetus? The fetus does not have a voice; therefore, pro-lifers speak for them. Pro-life advocates stress that termination should never be an option. </p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps pa brainly po</p><p>#CARRY_ON_LEARNING</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Symmetries that emerge from the analysis of the major arguments on either side of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems intractable.  Consider the following standard anti-abortion argument: Fetuses are both human and alive.  Humans have the right to life. Therefore, fetuses have the right to life.  Of course, women have the right to control their own bodies, but the right to life overrides the right of a woman to control her own body. Therefore, abortion is wrong.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><br />

In the Christian tradition, this argument is commonly articulated through a religious belief in a deeply personal relationship with God who has foreseen every aspect of our individual lives. Within this philosophy are varying degrees of provision for women whose health is threatened by carrying a pregnancy to term.</p><p></p><p>The <strong>second argues</strong> that induced abortion should not be needed in a just society. Most pithily summed in the talking point that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” this line of thinking envisions a world with extremely high levels of health and well-being. In such a world, in which women would not face reproductive coercion or sexual assault, in which everyone would have excellent health and healthcare, in which no families lived in poverty, all pregnancies would be wanted. Abortion would occur in rare cases of medical necessity.</p><p></p><p>And then there is a <strong>third argument</strong>, which is a scientific claim that induced abortion harms women’s health. This is a line of reasoning that has emerged as state legislators increasingly seek to enact laws to regulate the provision of abortion. Unlike the first two arguments, which are moral arguments, this third argument is an empirical one. The problem is that it is not grounded in fact.</p><p></p><p>•I Hope It Helps</p><br />

Abortion a violation against the 5th commandment.</p><p> First, let's understand what the 5th Commandment is -- "You shall not kill." So what is killing? The term killing is commonly identified as an act of taking somebody else's life and putting an end to it. This means that any form of causing the death of any human of God's creation directly violates this command</p><p>Everyone has the right to their own lives for God has personally given it to them -- handcrafted their bodies, personalities, and talents according to His liking. So knowing this, stealing the life of an innocent child that doesn't even have the power to choose for their own is undoubtedly a grave sin. Abortion is taking of a human being, their whole life, and future being taken away from them just like that. It's murder</p><br />

                        Did you know that there are about 3,700 abortions a day in the US? So approximately 1.3 million unpunished and LEGAL killings are occurring every year. I personally think that is absurd. Abortion is wrong and I am going to tell you why you shouldn’t get one or support them. Adoption, the after effects and the simple fact that it’s murder are all reasons why you shouldn’t go through with an abortion. I think that abortion is morally wrong and a highly debated topic in which there is a crystal clear answer. <p>Fist of all I just wan't to ask if ABORTION is good?</p><p>-of course no!</p><p></p><p>Abortion is to deliberate termination of a humans pregnancy, </p><p>Abortion is a crime!  it is bad! because , even if it is not totally formed as a human it has lives. that given by our almighty GOD, and no one can get it back except on him.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>                     </p><p>Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% to 40% of pregnancies.</p><p></p><p>The cause of abortion are miscarriage </p><p></p><p>A miscarriage (also called a spontaneous abortion) is the unexpected ending of a pregnancy in the first 20 weeks of gestation. Just because it’s called a “miscarriage” doesn’t mean you did something wrong in carrying the pregnancy. Most miscarriages are beyond your control and occur beacause fetus stops growing </p><p> </p><p>Types of miscarriage</p><p></p><p>Your pregnancy care provider may diagnose you with the following types of miscarriage:</p><p></p><p>Missed miscarriage: You’ve lost the pregnancy but are unaware it’s happened. There are no symptoms of miscarriage, but an ultrasound confirms the fetus has no heartbeat.Complete miscarriage: You’ve lost the pregnancy and your uterus is empty. You’ve experienced bleeding and passed fetal tissue. Your provider can confirm a complete miscarriage with an ultrasound.</p><p></p><p>Recurrent miscarriage: Three consecutive miscarriages. It affects about 1% of couples.</p><p></p><p>Threatened miscarriage: Your cervix stays closed, but you’re bleeding and experiencing pelvic cramping. The pregnancy typically continues with no further issues. Your pregnancy care provider may monitor you more closely for the rest of your pregnancy. </p><p></p><p>Inevitable miscarriage: You’re bleeding, cramping and your cervix has started to open (dilate). You may leak amniotic fluid. A complete miscarriage is likely.</p><p></p><p>What causes miscarriage?</p><p></p><p>Chromosomal abnormalities cause about 50% of all miscarriages in the first trimester (up to 13 weeks) of pregnancy. Chromosomes are tiny structures inside the cells of your body that carry your genes. Genes determine all of a person’s physical attributes, such as assigned sex, hair and eye color and blood type.</p><p></p><p>During fertilization, when the egg and sperm join, two sets of chromosomes come together. If an egg or sperm has more or fewer chromosomes than normal, the fetus will have an abnormal number. As a fertilized egg grows into a fetus, its cells divide and multiply several times. Abnormalities during this process also leads to miscarriage.</p><p></p><p>Most chromosomal problems occur by chance. It’s not completely known why this happens.</p><p></p><p>Several factors may cause miscarriage:</p><p></p><p>Infection.Exposure to TORCH diseases.Hormonal imbalances.Improper implantation of fertilized egg in your uterine lining.How old you are.Uterine abnormalities.Incompetent cervix (your cervix begins to open too early in pregnancy).Lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking alcohol or using recreational drugs.Disorders of the immune system like lupus.Severe kidney disease.Congenital heart disease.Diabetes that isn't managed.Thyroid disease.Radiation.Certain medicines, such as the acne drug isotretinoin (Accutane®).Severe malnutrition.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope I help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Paragraph 1: Abortion is a controversial issue in the Philippines, as it is in many countries. The government has long held a stance against granting women the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy, and the church has been vocal in its opposition to allowing women the choice to have an abortion. Despite this opposition, there are many arguments in favor of legalizing abortion in the Philippines. </p><p></p><p>Paragraph 2: One of the main arguments in support of legalizing abortion is the protection of women's health. Terminating a pregnancy can be safer for the mother than carrying a child to term. In some cases, the physical and mental health of the mother is at risk if she is forced to give birth. Legalizing abortion will allow women to make informed decisions about their own health and safety. </p><p></p><p>Paragraph 3: Another argument in favor of legalizing abortion is that it will help reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies. Unplanned pregnancies can lead to poverty and other negative outcomes, so giving women access to safe and legal abortions can help them avoid these situations. Allowing women to make decisions about their own bodies and reproductive health is a major step towards gender equality.  Legalizing abortion in the Philippines is a necessary step towards ensuring the safety and well-being of</p><br />

                        ISSUE: FOR AND AGAINST ABORTION<br /><br />SPEAKERS' ARGUMENTS<p><strong>RIZALITO DAVID: ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST</strong></p><p>Advocating abortion is not doing your fellowmen good. That's anti-human. It's not merely faith. It has something to do with his concern for humanity too. He said that what we're upholding is a woman's right, a woman's right to live, and a healthy life free from disability.</p><p></p><p><strong>CLAIRE PADILLA: LAWYER AND PRO-ABORTION ACTIVIST</strong></p><p>She became interested in advocating for safe and legal abortion rights. When she handled one case of a young woman, she was 18 years old but her mental age was around 5 years old. She was gang-raped twice, and she became pregnant as a result of the rape. Claire was thinking that the young woman was just like any other small kid who does not really have the capacity to take care of the child.</p><p>Since then, Claire said that there really should be access to safe and legal abortion in the Philippines. At the very least, for life-and-death issues, rape, and fetal impairment. But she believed the scope should be whatever reason the woman might need an abortion.</p><p></p>HAVE YOU HEARD OF THIS ISSUE? HOW SERIOUS IS THE ISSUE IN YOUR AREA?<p>Yes, I have heard this issue before and this is a serious issue that has been circulating in the Philippines.</p><p></p>BASED ON THE ARGUMENTS OF THE TWO SPEAKERS YOU HAVE LISTENED TO, WHO DO YOU AGREE WITH? WHY?<p>Based on the arguments of the two speakers, I shall concur with Mr. Rizalito David because of my belief also. I believe that aborting is a form of killing. Yes, it may not be the plan of a woman to be pregnant but please fight to save the unborn child's life. It is not the baby's mistake that he/she might be born. </p><p>Furthermore, since we can't always be certain during the procedure, having an abortion can be harmful to a woman's health. For the process, there are many reactions and adverse effects. By implementing specific projects and protecting the rights of single moms around the Philippines, the government may assist and focus on raising a child.</p><p></p>WHAT DO YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM?<p>The government might help for financial assistance for a single mom until the legal age of the child.</p><p></p><p>To learn more about abortion, just click the link below:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/28125978</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/29152956</p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                            13. Write an argumentative essay of controversial topics related to Christianity about Abortion with Introduction, Body, Conclusion, Overall​</h2><br />
                        <p>Introduction:</p><p></p><p>Abortion is a highly controversial topic in Christianity, with divergent opinions and beliefs. Some Christians believe that life begins at conception and that terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to murder, while others argue that it is a personal choice and that women should have the right to decide what happens to their bodies. This essay explores the argumentative issues surrounding abortion in Christianity, highlighting both sides of the debate.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p></p><p>On one hand, those who oppose abortion believe that it is morally wrong to take the life of an unborn child. For Christians, life is sacred and should be protected at all costs. Many Christians argue that since life begins at conception, any deliberate termination of pregnancy is a violation of God's commandment not to kill. They believe that life is a gift from God, and no one has the right to take it away. Such people may also argue that every child has a purpose in life, and that aborting a pregnancy deprives the child of their destiny.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, supporters of abortion in Christianity argue that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be left to the woman carrying the fetus. They believe that women have the right to make choices about their bodies, including whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term. They argue that forcing women to continue unwanted pregnancies is cruel and unjust, and that it can lead to emotional and psychological distress for both the mother and the child.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, some Christians believe that there are circumstances where abortion may be necessary, such as when the mother's life is at risk, or when the fetus has severe abnormalities that would make survival after birth unlikely. In such cases, they argue that it is better to terminate the pregnancy than to allow the mother or the child to suffer.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the issue of abortion in Christianity is a highly contentious one, with valid arguments on both sides. While some Christians believe that life begins at conception and that abortion is equivalent to murder, others argue that women should have the right to make choices about their bodies. It is important to respect each other's views and opinions on this matter, and to recognize that it is often a deeply personal and emotional issue. Ultimately, Christians should strive to find common ground and work towards solutions that protect both the sanctity of life and the rights of women.</p><br />

                            14. abortion should be banned using persuasive speech </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I stand before you today to talk about a topic that has been heavily debated and discussed in recent times - abortion. As a society, we have been divided on this issue and it is time for us to come together and take a stand. I strongly believe that abortion should be banned.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, abortion goes against the sanctity of human life. Every human being has the right to life and no one has the right to take that away. By allowing abortion, we are giving individuals the power to decide who gets to live and who doesn't, which goes against the very foundation of human rights.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, abortion poses serious risks to the mother's health. While some may argue that it is a safe medical procedure, the truth is that it can lead to complications such as infection, bleeding, and even death. In addition, there are long-term psychological effects on the mother such as guilt, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, abortion denies the child the right to life and the opportunity to grow and thrive. Many women who have had abortions have later regretted their decision and have spoken about the emotional trauma they have faced as a result. It is unfair to rob a child of its chance at life simply because it is inconvenient for the mother.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, there are alternatives to abortion such as adoption. Adoption allows the child to be raised in a loving and caring environment and also allows the mother to make the selfless decision of giving her child a chance at life.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that abortion should be banned. It goes against the sanctity of human life, poses risks to the mother's health, denies the child the right to life, and there are alternative options available. Let us come together and stand up for the rights of the unborn and protect the sanctity of human life. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Legalized abortion is having a destructive effect on our society; few other actions legalized by our public policy as profoundly undermine our values as a people or upset the moral compass by which we live. The Church has always condemned abortion. In the Didache (The Teaching of the Apostles), 2, 2, written toward the end of the first century and revered as an honored guide for Christian life, we read, “You shall not kill the embryo by abortion.” This teaching has never changed and it will not change.</p><p><strong>: Forewarning ꒱꒱ ̣ ̟</strong></p><p>‧₊˚↷ This topic is eminently sensitive and may seem offensive for some users.

Abortion  Abortion is an act which intends to bring about the death of a fetus for the sake of the woman who carries it. The main argument against abortion is based on the right to life. Abortion is considered as plain murder of an innocent being; and for that it is deserves the gravest condemnation. Because of the unborn status of the subject of abortion, the controversy usually revolves around the debate whether the subject in the womb is already a person, or not; or to put it in another perspective, whether the subject inside the woman has life already, or not. Most pro-abortion arguments will argue for the acceptability of abortion because they do not recognize the fetus, or the embryo as constituting a human person who deserves the right to life. The basic argument thus runs: Every person has a right to life. The fetus is not yet a person. Therefore, the fetus does not have yet the right to life. An analogy may perhaps simplify this. A presidential candidate is a potential president; but she does not deserve the rights and privileges of an actual president until she wins the election. Similarly, a fetus who is a potential person, does not possess the right to life because it is not yet a person.  We have to see the important aspect of this pro-abortion argument-that is, killing a person is wrong. They only argue for the permissibility of abortion because they do not consider fetuses or embryos as persons. That is why most of the arguments are directed to the issue of determining when life is produced. As for the Vatican, abortion is a termination of life, and it is therefore wrong. The right to life must not be discriminating. The Vatican declares: "The right to life is no less to be respected in the small infant just born than in the mature person." In reality, respect for human life is called for from the time that the process of generation begins.​</h2><br />

The controversy centers on the question of whether a fetus is considered a human person with the right to life or not. Pro-abortion arguments argue that fetuses or embryos do not possess the right to life because they are not yet considered persons. On the other hand, the Vatican considers abortion as a termination of life and therefore wrong, as it is a violation of the right to life which must be respected for all humans from the moment of conception. The essay concludes by emphasizing the importance of respect for human life from the beginning of the process of generation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Tips are provided on how to write an argumentative essay on abortion
</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you are going to write an argumentative essay on abortion, you need to be able to present compelling arguments and data to support them.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>An argumentative essay is where a student presents both side of a given situation. You will need to investigate, collect data, present them and establish your own position on the matter.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So on the matter of abortion there will be two sides:  pro and against. But first define what abortion is and research on Philippine laws covering abortion.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Are we allowed to have it?
</strong></p><p><strong>Are there abortion clinics here like they have in the USA? What happens to woman if they have an abortion?
</strong></p><p><strong>How many babies are aborted every day?
</strong></p><p><strong>These are some of the preliminary questions you need to know.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Now, after establishing the scenario, you need to take a stand, whether you are for it or against it. If for it, what arguments will you use? You could probably cite that a woman's body belong to her so it is her right. If you are against, you can probably argue that abortion is the same as killing a child, hence immoral and illegal.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>ang abortion o pag papalaglag ay pag alis ng isang fetus o sanggol sa sinapupunan ng isang ina</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Abortion</strong> is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive outside the uterus.[note 1] An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage".</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, being a Catholic country, abortion is <strong>illegal</strong>. We treat this as <strong>immoral</strong>. We strictly follow not only the human law but also the 6th commandment of the Lord, <strong>"You shall not murder."</strong></p><p>Performing abortion only on the basis of a woman's request is allowed in 30 percent of countries, including in the US, Canada, most European countries, and China, with 42 percent of the world's population living in such countries. <strong>There are no international or multinational treaties that deal directly with abortion but human rights law touches on the issues.</strong></p><br />

                            29. why it is wrong make a debate about against on legalisation of abortion​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Abortion can be good or bad. It depends on what country we deal with it or where we are talking about it. Because if we talked about abortion here in Philippines, its no doubt a bad thing. Philippines is a very religious country that is very against about abortion for abortion is taking someone's life, it is indeed ending a baby's life inside her mom's womb. So, legalizing abortion here in Philippines will go through a very long way to go or it will never really happen.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:Abortion is the most controversial issue having no grounds of
</strong></p><p><strong>agreement among two polar aspects. The argument is life and death though
</strong></p><p><strong>the uncertainty of complication makes it difficult. I don’t believe in abortion
</strong></p><p><strong>because it’s murder we are not the ones that can decide whether the person
</strong></p><p><strong>that a woman gives birth to should live or die. Abortion is a life or death
</strong></p><p><strong>matter, having equal supporters on both sides. Yet those supporters have
</strong></p><p><strong>one goal in common: decreasing the number of abortions and making
</strong></p><p><strong>abortion safer.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
