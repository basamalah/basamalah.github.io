</strong></p><p><strong>I am born in this land after the simplicity and peace

</strong></p><p><strong>For plebeians are we, lived as birds
</strong></p><p><strong>Do headway en masse more than a herd
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Do say everything has an end
</strong></p><p><strong>For every happiness is torment
</strong></p><p><strong>But deemed for what is right
</strong></p><p><strong>For right is always worth the fight
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Almost centuries of four in agony and torture
</strong></p><p><strong>For we-- underneath the foreign power
</strong></p><p><strong>Hand in hand we sought for just
</strong></p><p><strong>For happiness again, for caste blanche
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>They may call for swords, mortars and whips
</strong></p><p><strong>With chains and blindfold, we hoped for peace
</strong></p><p><strong>Still we reckoned, to do harm is no good
</strong></p><p><strong>So what's slashed is the given brain, a pen, and veiled words
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Land shredded with its race' warm blood, our sweats and tears
</strong></p><p><strong>Yet still standing tall with valor, no fears
</strong></p><p><strong>For believe, we have, these intertwined hearts are our core
</strong></p><p><strong>Sweet sampaguita, we vowed to you, you're worth dying for
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>There's a rainbow after the rain, as like Juno's 12 in '98
</strong></p><p><strong>For independence was swayed, joyous cries aren't suppressed
</strong></p><p><strong>Twenty past four post meridiem, 'twas held up in a balcony
</strong></p><p><strong>With cheers side to side, I've cried, we're free!
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Though aftermath, undeniably, we still grapple with wretchedness
</strong></p><p><strong>We, erstwhile defender of our land, hoped you'd reminisce
</strong></p><p><strong>Commemorate not us of yore, but how loved and treasured
</strong></p><p><strong>The freedom before like a taboo, yet for it, lives were offered
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Before I put down this pen I've slashed, I'll left you with some advice
</strong></p><p><strong>Fight for what's yours, for what you know is right
</strong></p><p><strong>If chained with locks, blindfolded with lies, and shouldered pains as torr
</strong></p><p><strong>Stand up! For every thing's with worth, and like sampaguita, you'd grasp twenty past four.!</strong></p><p><strong>TAGALUGIN MO NALANG </strong></p><p></p><br />
