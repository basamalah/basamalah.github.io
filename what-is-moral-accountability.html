                                            CASE 2. Returning Unspent Money Jerome is running Children's Joy Foundation, Inc. to help street children. He receives a government grant of one million pesos for a project to teach out-of-school youths who live in the streets of their city. A year passes, Jerome managed to utilize only Php 500,000 from the grant. Despite his best efforts, he couldn’t convince many poor children or their families to join his program. As per the grant rules, Jerome has to return all the unspent money back to the government by the end of March 31st. But his colleague Raniel says: “If we honestly return the remaining Php 500,000 from the grant, the government officials may think that we are amateurs and ineffective in running the foundation, and they may substantially reduce our grant next year or even worse, they may not give us any project in the future. We should ask for the help of our chief accountant to manipulate our account books and reflect that majority of the grant was utilized for education. Many other foundations are doing the same thing. There wouldn’t be a problem since nobody will raise an objection, as long as we offer the 20% of the remaining grant to our accountant. Although it sounds unethical, we will not use the money for our personal needs and we will use it for the street children only. Hence, our act is fully ethical and moral.” QUESTION: What should Jerome do with the money?</a>

I am not familiar with many human customs, but I am willing to assist you with your question or assignment to the best of my abilities. Please, do not hesitate to ask for my help.</p>Moral Accountability <p>Moral accountability is typically based on three main factors: intention, action, and consequence.</p><p></p><strong>Intention</strong>: This refers to the motivations and reasons behind a person's actions. In determining moral accountability, it is often considered important to consider a person's intentions and whether they were acting with good or bad intentions.<strong>Action</strong>: The specific actions taken by a person are also an important factor in determining moral accountability. This can include not only the specific actions that a person takes, but also whether they have fulfilled their obligations and responsibilities in a given situation.<strong>Consequence</strong>: The consequences of a person's actions are also an important factor in determining moral accountability. This can include not only the immediate consequences of a person's actions, but also any longer-term effects that their actions may have.<p></p><p>These three factors are not always equally relevant in every situation, and the specific weight given to each one can vary depending on the specific circumstances. However, they are generally considered to be the main bases for determining moral accountability.</p>______________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day</strong><strong>!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            11. 1.                 What might account for the drop in absenteeism and the increase in morale?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The causes of absenteeism at workplace can be divided into two groups:</p><p>Personal factors (attitude, age, seniority and gender) and workplace factors (job stress, work routine and job satisfaction). The changes of work design have removed and/or reduced all three possible workplace factors. Job stress reduced since the workers received more autonomy and gained more recognition related to the results of their work. High level of job routine has been significantly reduced, and workers could control the results of their assembly process, which they could not do in the original work design.</p><p>Importance of the work and associated morale are determined by such factors as task significance, skill variety and task identity (Salvendy &amp; Karwowski, 2004). In the original work design, task significance was comparatively low, skill variety and task identity were very low, and it is not surprising that work morale was low as well. In the new design, task significance was strongly increased, as well as skill variety. Now the workers could identify their hotplates, and thus task identity was increased, too. The above-mentioned factors caused the increase in moral.</p><p></p><p>#HOPRITHELPS❋</p><p></p><br />

                            15. CASE 2. Returning Unspent Money Jerome is running Children's Joy Foundation, Inc. to help street children. He receives a government grant of one million pesos for a project to teach out-of-school youths who live in the streets of their city. A year passes, Jerome managed to utilize only Php 500,000 from the grant. Despite his best efforts, he couldn’t convince many poor children or their families to join his program. As per the grant rules, Jerome has to return all the unspent money back to the government by the end of March 31st. But his colleague Raniel says: “If we honestly return the remaining Php 500,000 from the grant, the government officials may think that we are amateurs and ineffective in running the foundation, and they may substantially reduce our grant next year or even worse, they may not give us any project in the future. We should ask for the help of our chief accountant to manipulate our account books and reflect that majority of the grant was utilized for education. Many other foundations are doing the same thing. There wouldn’t be a problem since nobody will raise an objection, as long as we offer the 20% of the remaining grant to our accountant. Although it sounds unethical, we will not use the money for our personal needs and we will use it for the street children only. Hence, our act is fully ethical and moral.” QUESTION: What should Jerome do with the money?</h2><br />
