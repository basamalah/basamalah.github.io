                                            . Classifying Ideas
 There are times that we are given a group of words that seems unclear to us and shows no relevance. But when we learn to group them under distinct groups then we come to an understanding. This process is what we call classifying ideas.
 In classifying ideas it is necessary that we know the meaning of the words presented to us. It is only when we know their meaning can we group them together. 
 Classifying ideas sharpen our reasoning abilities and improves our vocabulary.
 1. Example: Items to classify: red, grapes, oranges, yellow, green, apples 
 When classified they fall under the group Colors and Fruits, respectively.
 Answer: Colors- red, yellow, green Fruits- grapes, oranges, apples 
 2. Classify the group of words: Philippines, Korea, Japan, Taiwan
 a. Name of persons b. Name of Schools c. Name of Countries Answer: c. Name of Countries
 3. Classify the following ideas: washing clothes, sweeping the yard, watering the plants
 a. Games played b. household chores c. subjects in school Answer: b. household chores</a>

                            15. . Classifying Ideas
 There are times that we are given a group of words that seems unclear to us and shows no relevance. But when we learn to group them under distinct groups then we come to an understanding. This process is what we call classifying ideas.
 In classifying ideas it is necessary that we know the meaning of the words presented to us. It is only when we know their meaning can we group them together. 
 Classifying ideas sharpen our reasoning abilities and improves our vocabulary.
 1. Example: Items to classify: red, grapes, oranges, yellow, green, apples 
 When classified they fall under the group Colors and Fruits, respectively.
 Answer: Colors- red, yellow, green Fruits- grapes, oranges, apples 
 2. Classify the group of words: Philippines, Korea, Japan, Taiwan
 a. Name of persons b. Name of Schools c. Name of Countries Answer: c. Name of Countries
 3. Classify the following ideas: washing clothes, sweeping the yard, watering the plants
 a. Games played b. household chores c. subjects in school Answer: b. household chores</h2><br />
