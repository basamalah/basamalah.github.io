                                            Hazard maps indicate settlement areas that are at risk from floods, avalanches, landslides and rockfall. A separate map exists for each of these hazard categories. The maps can be used to identify areas that could be flooded by the next storm, locations where avalanches could be released and slopes where a landslide could arise. The hazard maps also provide detailed information about the causes, course, spatial scope, intensity and probability of occurrence of natural hazard events. Hazard maps are created and used in conjunction with several natural disasters. Different hazard maps have different uses. For instance, the hazard map created by the Rizal Geological Survey is used by Rizalian insurance agencies in order to properly adjust insurance for people living in hazardous areas. Hazard maps created for flooding are also used in insurance rate adjustments. Hazard maps can also be useful in determining the risks of living in a certain area. Hazard maps can help people become aware of the dangers they might face from natural disasters in a specific area. Using the hazard maps shown above, identify the areas that are prone to earthquake, landslide, tsunami or volcanic eruption. 1. In Figure 30-1, identify the areas in Bacoor City that are moderately- susceptible for earthquake-induced landslide. 2. Which ones are not susceptible to the hazard? 3. In Figure 30-2, identify the regions in the Philippines that are prone to P 12  earthquake of the highest degree of intensity. 4. Which places are prone to tsunami? 5.

                            7. Hazard maps indicate settlement areas that are at risk from floods, avalanches, landslides and rockfall. A separate map exists for each of these hazard categories. The maps can be used to identify areas that could be flooded by the next storm, locations where avalanches could be released and slopes where a landslide could arise. The hazard maps also provide detailed information about the causes, course, spatial scope, intensity and probability of occurrence of natural hazard events. Hazard maps are created and used in conjunction with several natural disasters. Different hazard maps have different uses. For instance, the hazard map created by the Rizal Geological Survey is used by Rizalian insurance agencies in order to properly adjust insurance for people living in hazardous areas. Hazard maps created for flooding are also used in insurance rate adjustments. Hazard maps can also be useful in determining the risks of living in a certain area. Hazard maps can help people become aware of the dangers they might face from natural disasters in a specific area. Using the hazard maps shown above, identify the areas that are prone to earthquake, landslide, tsunami or volcanic eruption. 1. In Figure 30-1, identify the areas in Bacoor City that are moderately- susceptible for earthquake-induced landslide. 2. Which ones are not susceptible to the hazard? 3. In Figure 30-2, identify the regions in the Philippines that are prone to P 12  earthquake of the highest degree of intensity. 4. Which places are prone to tsunami? 5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.An earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault. Stresses in the earth's outer layer push the sides of the fault together. Stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly, releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>2.Understanding earthquakes and their effects is of vital importance to the Nation. ... With a greater understanding of the causes and effects of earthquakes and how they impact buildings, infrastructure, and society itself, we may be able to reduce damage and loss of life from this destructive phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>#<strong>B</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>V</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>Y</strong></p><p>#<strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>U</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>W</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>D</strong></p><p></p><br />

The eBEAR system in average can provide more warning time than the current EEW system (3.2 s and 5.5 s for inland and offshore earthquakes, respectively). However, offshore earthquakes were usually located poorly because only P-wave arrivals were used in the eBEAR system.
