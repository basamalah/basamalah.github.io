I really need help with this question, can you look it up for me? My school has blocked sites in where i can find the answer. 
In a popular online role playing game, players can create detailed designs for their character's "costumes," or appearance. Scarlet sets up a website where players can buy and sell these costumes online. Information about the number of people who visited the website and the number of costumes purchased in a single day is listed below.
236 visitors purchased no costume.
202 visitors purchased exactly one costume.
40 visitors purchased more than one costume.
Based on these results, express the probability that the next person will purchase no more than one costume as a fraction in simplest form.</a>

                            1. rhetorical question about online gaming​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I know that the resounding answer is going to be yes but here is my argument. I only have the time to play games on the spare occasion. While those short times have increased lately (due to my job's "season" ending) I still find that it's easier to just sit in front of the TV and play a game without having to upgrade something on a computer. Besides for that I already own a 360 and I feel like for the amount of gaming that I do it would be pointless to invest into a hardcore gaming system. Besides for that the only thing I have that can even run a game is an Acer Laptop that has a video card so shoddy I can't even pass the can you run it test for Portal 2. The idea of additional user made content for games and the mods is highly appealing but something I feel I could live without. To finish my opinion on this I also have a larger friend base that plays console games as opposed to PC gaming. So what I'm really asking here is should I actually take the time and money to invest in a PC (which would take me awhile with my low income right now) or should I just stick to burning through my money with console gaming?</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A growing research literature suggests that regular electronic game play and game-based training programs may confer practically significant benefits to cognitive functioning. Most evidence supporting this idea, the gaming-enhancement hypothesis, has been collected in small-scale studies of university students and older adults. This research investigated the hypothesis in a general way with a large sample of 1,847 school-aged children. Our aim was to examine the relations between young people’s gaming experiences and an objective test of reasoning performance. Using a Bayesian hypothesis testing approach, evidence for the gaming-enhancement and null hypotheses were compared.</strong></p><br />
