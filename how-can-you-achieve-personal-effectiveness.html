Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</a>

                                            SELF DISCIPLINE IN THE AMIDST OF PANDEMIC
The corona virus or known for the name Covid-1, According to health experts believe that
the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to
humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person
contact. (Goodwin, 2020). Later on this corona virus has spread drastically in many parts of the
world. And to be exact, March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the Covid-19 as pandemic.
At this time of pandemic there are a lot of problems an individual may experience. It can
be either internal or external problem. But let us consider managing ourselves by mean of
achieving self-discipline. This may be difficult but in order to have a healthy and professional life.
One must take a look at this. He/She might experience problem on dealing with everyday living.
Because of the problem caused by the pandemic. One of the best ways to achieve sel-disciplined
person makes optimum use of time, provide a timetable for everything and will fall into it's proper
places.
The reason why a lot of people feel they lack self-discipline it is because they lack clear
goals to achieve. Then often lack of clear plan, self-confidence, and a lot more. What is the
cause of this? Once you set a goal for example and then you miss it. That's the time where the
effect of that day will ruin everything you have planned. But that's okay, you can start over and
over again. Then later on the good thing is, when you think about the things you already manage
to do, the goals you already have, you might have realized that you are achieving something at
the end of the day.
How to maintain inner peace in the midst of this pandemic? First is to have a self-
discipline that means self-control, it gives you the ability to control yourself from everything
especially right now. It helps you deal with your actions and reaction in different aspects of life.
Second is to do meditation, the best way to connect our energy in the right way. It helps you
maintain your focus and think of the most important things. Lastly, stay away from distractions
or negative vibes. Although this may happen at times, but make sure to have a balance on how
to deal with it.
The life we had before the pandemic is really different from the life we have today. There
are things we usually do before the pandemic happens. Before, people can easily earn money
because they have the assurance of being paid by their institution. But now, Everyday people
are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return. No matter what
happen we have to remember that everything happens for a reason. Through self-discipline, It
is one of the most important and useful skills to achieve success and everyone should possess
this quality especially during this time.

                            20. Read the following persuasive essay carefully. Encircle the verbs, box the adjectives, and underline the adverbs that express strong or pressing points. Why People Should Exercise In the past, I have never been inclined to participate in sports. Honestly, I did not like it, but many persons whom I lived with kept telling me every day how good it was. Since the peer pressure was growing, I decided to go to the gym. It was not until then that I could really understand people when they said exercise really helped a person get organized and keep yourself healthy, physically and mentally. For starters, when you are a lazy person, it is difficult to take the first step, but it is all a matter of committing yourself to something that will provide you a lot of positive feedback. Once you start doing exercise and observing positive results, you enjoy it. It takes a lot of effort and strong will, but it's worth it. The principal thing to do is to participate in an activity you like. If you do you’ll start organizing your day in a way that enables you to do everything you have to, including exercising. You will no longer be a person stressed-out without time to carry on with all your activities. Second, it is obvious that once you exercise you will have a better condition. You will be healthier in a physical way. It is probable that you will lose weight and your muscles will get stronger and stronger. Your body will feel good, full of energy and it will respond immediately to any action you want to do, any activity that has to be done with high spirits. The third reason why exercising is good is that it affects you positively in a mental and psychological way. Doing exercise helps you set specific goals which along with strong will can be achieved. When you do that, you are aware of your abilities, accept your weaknesses, and your self-esteem goes up. Any sport distracts you because it helps you not to think about school, friends, problems, among other things. It brings you time to think about yourself and no one else. It helps you keep your mind busy and to avoid dangerous habits like drugs. Doing exercise is very important to any person of any age. The positive effects of exercising, which I’ve already mentioned, are like a chain. Once you do a sports activity that you like, you get organized; therefore, you start doing things the right way and get enormous benefits which make you feel good as a whole human being. You start living your life happily. ​</h2><br />

                            24. SELF DISCIPLINE IN THE AMIDST OF PANDEMIC
The corona virus or known for the name Covid-1, According to health experts believe that
the new strain of coronavirus likely originated in bats or pangolins. The first transmission to
humans was in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has mostly spread through person-to-person
contact. (Goodwin, 2020). Later on this corona virus has spread drastically in many parts of the
world. And to be exact, March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the Covid-19 as pandemic.
At this time of pandemic there are a lot of problems an individual may experience. It can
be either internal or external problem. But let us consider managing ourselves by mean of
achieving self-discipline. This may be difficult but in order to have a healthy and professional life.
One must take a look at this. He/She might experience problem on dealing with everyday living.
Because of the problem caused by the pandemic. One of the best ways to achieve sel-disciplined
person makes optimum use of time, provide a timetable for everything and will fall into it's proper
places.
The reason why a lot of people feel they lack self-discipline it is because they lack clear
goals to achieve. Then often lack of clear plan, self-confidence, and a lot more. What is the
cause of this? Once you set a goal for example and then you miss it. That's the time where the
effect of that day will ruin everything you have planned. But that's okay, you can start over and
over again. Then later on the good thing is, when you think about the things you already manage
to do, the goals you already have, you might have realized that you are achieving something at
the end of the day.
How to maintain inner peace in the midst of this pandemic? First is to have a self-
discipline that means self-control, it gives you the ability to control yourself from everything
especially right now. It helps you deal with your actions and reaction in different aspects of life.
Second is to do meditation, the best way to connect our energy in the right way. It helps you
maintain your focus and think of the most important things. Lastly, stay away from distractions
or negative vibes. Although this may happen at times, but make sure to have a balance on how
to deal with it.
The life we had before the pandemic is really different from the life we have today. There
are things we usually do before the pandemic happens. Before, people can easily earn money
because they have the assurance of being paid by their institution. But now, Everyday people
are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return. No matter what
happen we have to remember that everything happens for a reason. Through self-discipline, It
is one of the most important and useful skills to achieve success and everyone should possess
this quality especially during this time.
