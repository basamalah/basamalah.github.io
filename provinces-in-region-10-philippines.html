                                            # 1 The Philippine tarsier, (Tarsius syrichta or Carlito syrichta) is one of the smallest kinds of primates or monkeys. It lives on trees and can be found in the islands of Samar, Leyte, Bohol, and Mindanao in the Philippines. The locals call the tarsier “mamags” or “malmags”.  The tarsier is slowly getting endangered. Although the government has banned the hunting and selling of tarsiers to tourists, they are still in danger due to deforestation and illegal logging. Luckily, the government is now doing ways to preserve tarsiers. The Philippine Tarsier Foundation in Bohol is one place where people can visit tarsiers in their normal habitat.   Source # 2  The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) or the monkey-eating eagle is one of the largest and most powerful birds in the whole world. It is a native of the Philippines and can only be found in the forests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Unfortunately, the Philippine eagle is considered an endangered species, with only 400 pairs alive in the wild. They are the victims of shooting and hunting; they are also dying because of deforestation. The Philippine government already have several laws that provide protection to the Philippine eagle.   Source # 3  The Tamaraw, known scientifically as Bubalus mindorensis is an animal endemic or native to Mindoro, a province located in Region IVA of Luzon.  It belongs to the family of buffalos, like the carabao which is more common. People used to call Mindoro the “Land of Tamaraws” but sadly, that was a long time ago. In the 1990s, around 10, 000 tamaraws were roaming in the province. This number decreased to 369 during the 1980s and in the present time, only around 20 tamaraws are said to exist in Mindoro. The tamaraws are indeed in great danger of getting extinct.   My synthesis: __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

If it does, suggest ways on how to address it. If it does not, justify the claim for equality.3. In Mindanao, the southernmost and second largest of the Philippines' islands, six of the 10 regions are among the top 10 nationally in terms of poverty rates, with between 25 and 40 percent of families living in utter poverty. Nationwide, the 30 most deprived provinces are home to more than one-third of the Philippines poorest families, resulting in generational poverty that is incredibly difficult to emerge from.

                            12. # 1 The Philippine tarsier, (Tarsius syrichta or Carlito syrichta) is one of the smallest kinds of primates or monkeys. It lives on trees and can be found in the islands of Samar, Leyte, Bohol, and Mindanao in the Philippines. The locals call the tarsier “mamags” or “malmags”.  The tarsier is slowly getting endangered. Although the government has banned the hunting and selling of tarsiers to tourists, they are still in danger due to deforestation and illegal logging. Luckily, the government is now doing ways to preserve tarsiers. The Philippine Tarsier Foundation in Bohol is one place where people can visit tarsiers in their normal habitat.   Source # 2  The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) or the monkey-eating eagle is one of the largest and most powerful birds in the whole world. It is a native of the Philippines and can only be found in the forests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Unfortunately, the Philippine eagle is considered an endangered species, with only 400 pairs alive in the wild. They are the victims of shooting and hunting; they are also dying because of deforestation. The Philippine government already have several laws that provide protection to the Philippine eagle.   Source # 3  The Tamaraw, known scientifically as Bubalus mindorensis is an animal endemic or native to Mindoro, a province located in Region IVA of Luzon.  It belongs to the family of buffalos, like the carabao which is more common. People used to call Mindoro the “Land of Tamaraws” but sadly, that was a long time ago. In the 1990s, around 10, 000 tamaraws were roaming in the province. This number decreased to 369 during the 1980s and in the present time, only around 20 tamaraws are said to exist in Mindoro. The tamaraws are indeed in great danger of getting extinct.   My synthesis: __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
