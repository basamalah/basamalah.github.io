What is the role of pressure in the set up?Let us relate this concept to what is happening inside the volcano. Magma inside the volcano has hightemperature. As the magma is continuously heated, it goes up. As it rises, gas bubbles are developed. The gasbubbles are trapped and expanded causing the molten material to swell also, resulting in a gradual increase inpressure within the volcano. When the pressure exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, fracturing occurs. Theresulting breaks lead to a further drop in confining pressure, which in turn causes even more gas bubbles to form​</a>

Q. 1 Do you have the same observation as in the softdrinks?Q. 2Explain your answer.In this activity, you have seen the effect of temperature on the amount of gas that can be produced in a liquid. How does this effect the pressure inside the bottle? What is the role of pressure in the set-up?((Nonsense answer = report)) ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>A.</p><p>1. In each bottle, we observed the production of gas, which caused the balloon on top of the bottle to inflate.</p><p>2. The gas produced in the bottles is carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of the reaction between baking soda and vinegar. The reaction produces carbonic acid, which quickly breaks down into water and carbon dioxide. As the gas is produced, it fills the bottle and pushes the air out of the balloon, causing it to inflate.</p><p>3. Hot water was added to one of the bottles to demonstrate that the reaction between baking soda and vinegar is temperature-dependent. When the temperature is increased, the reaction occurs more quickly, producing more gas and causing the balloon to inflate faster.</p><p></p><p>B.</p><p>1. Yes</p><p>2.  Soft drinks also contain carbon dioxide gas, which is produced through a similar reaction to the one between baking soda and vinegar. The gas is added to the drink under pressure, which keeps it dissolved in the liquid. When the bottle or can is opened, the pressure is released, and the gas comes out of the solution.</p><p></p><p>Pressure plays a crucial role in the set-up because it is the force that pushes the gas out of the bottle and into the balloon. As the gas is produced, it creates a higher pressure inside the bottle than outside, which forces the gas to move from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. The balloon on top of the bottle allows the gas to escape while keeping the air out, creating a closed system where the pressure can build up until it is sufficient to inflate the balloon.</p><br />

What did you observe when you poured vinegar into the bottle? What does yourobservation represent?2. What do you think caused the baking soda to rise? Where did it flow?3. How is the activity similar to a real erupting volcano?4. What damage can volcanic eruption bring when lava starts to flow?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.Why does this happen? The red lava is the result of a chemical reaction between the baking soda and vinegar. In this reaction, the carbon dioxide gas is produced, pressure builds up inside the plastic bottle until the gas bubbles out of the volcano. This is a good representation of what happens in real volcanoes.</p><p></p><p>2.Foam is pockets of air or gas trapped in a thin layer of liquid. Foam does not form on pure water, as water likes to stick together. Air bubbles rising to the water surface push through and escape. Adding surfactants to the water allows the soapy liquid to spread out and trap the air bubbles, so a layer of foam forms.</p><p></p><p>3.Model volcano are far not warmer or hot, real volcano especially active volcanoes are far more hotter. In model volcano, the lava are not hotter and are not came from inside the volcano, you just pour substances onto it causing chemical reaction as if it explode.</p><br />

Components of the mixture are not in indefinite proportions. Also, the components of the mixtures retain their identities. A mixture can either be a homogeneous and a heterogeneous mixture. A homogeneous mixture or solution is a kind of mixture wherein the components are distributed uniformly thus we see only a single phase. Specifically, in a homogeneous mixture, the solute is completely dissolved in the solvent. Examples of homogeneous mixtures are salt solution, juice, or brass. </p><p>In a heterogeneous mixture, on the other hand, the components are not distributed uniformly in the mixture. Components are easily distinguishable. They are made up of two or more phases. Examples of heterogeneous mixtures are soil, vegetable soup, mixed nuts, and smog.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST </p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>1. When I flicked <strong>Bottle A</strong>, it did not move. When I flicked <strong>Bottle B</strong>, it flicked a little bit. When I flicked <strong>Bottle C</strong>, it toppled on the table.</p><p>2. Bottle A did not topple as the tablecloth is pulled quickly. This is because Bottle A is the heaviest among three bottles. Bottle B and Bottle C are half-filled and empty, respectively which they have less inertia than Bottle A. In addition, Bottle A did not topple because of Newton's first law of motion – the Law of Inertia. <strong>Law of Inertia explains that the body or object will stay at rest unless acted upon by an external net force – which means the force exerted on the tablecloth did not affect Bottle A so it remains on its place.</strong></p><p>3. <strong>Inertia is directly proportional to the mass of the body.</strong> <strong>The more massive the body is, the greater its inertia.</strong> For example, between a bicycle and a truck, the truck is more massive so it has greater inertia, which means it is harder to move when it is at rest, and harder to stop when it is moving in uniform path.</p><p>4. In the activity, it shows that when you flicked three bottles, <strong>it is harder to move or topple Bottle A because it is more massive and has greater inertia.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Read more about Law of Inertia here:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/581015</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />

                        <p>This experiment pertains to how volcanoes erupt. In each bottle,
bubbles and pressure are building up. Chemical reactions are taking place in
all the bottles.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the setup, the role of the hot water is to act as the
pressure that is building up inside the volcano. Apparently, water vapor is a
big factor in eruptions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As with the soda, bubbles also cause pressure.</p>

Slowly unscrew the caps and observedQuestion 4Do you have the same observation as in the soft drinks?Question 5Explain your answer.In the activity, you have seen the effect of temperature on the amount of gas that can be produced in a liquidHow does this affect the pressure inside the bottle? What is the role of pressure in the set up?Let us relate this concept to what is happening inside the volcano. Magma inside the volcano has hightemperature. As the magma is continuously heated, it goes up. As it rises, gas bubbles are developed. The gasbubbles are trapped and expanded causing the molten material to swell also, resulting in a gradual increase inpressure within the volcano. When the pressure exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, fracturing occurs. Theresulting breaks lead to a further drop in confining pressure, which in turn causes even more gas bubbles to form​</h2><br />

                        1.does the oil sink to the bottom of the bottle, sit on top of the water or mix with it? Because oil is less dense than water, it will always float on top of water, creating a surface layer of oil.<p></p>2.Does the oil sink to the bottom, sit on top of the water or mix with it? Oil and alcohol are miscible (can mix evenly). ... When a droplet of oil is dropped into a container filled with alcohol, it fully dissolves, implying that oil is miscible with alcohol.<p></p><strong>3.Did anything change when you shake the bottles? Did both of the mixtures look the same? if not, what is different between them, how would you explain the differences that you observe? </strong>Roll the bottle on its side and let it settle for a few minutes. The water will sink to the bottom and the oil will rise to the top<p></p><p></p>4. How do the oil and water look like in each bottle? Has the oil mixed with the water, sunk to the bottom or risen to the top? As a result, when you add oil to a cup of water the two don't mix with each other. Because oil is less dense than water, it will always float on top of water, creating a surface layer of oil. <p></p><p></p><p></p>5. What is the scientific explanation of your observation in relation to polarity of molecules?In chemistry, polarity is a separation of electric charge leading to a molecule or its chemical groups having an electric dipole moment, with a negatively charged end and a positively charged end. <br />
