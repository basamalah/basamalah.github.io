                        <p>To explain sound decision-making to Grade 7 learners, I would use the following illustration with stick figures and thought balloons:</p><p></p><p>(stick figure 1 standing in front of a fork in the road)</p><p>Thought balloon 1: "I have to decide which path to take. Which one should I choose?"</p><p></p><p>(stick figure 2 standing next to stick figure 1)</p><p>Thought balloon 2: "Let's think about this carefully before we make a decision. What are the pros and cons of each path?"</p><p></p><p>(stick figure 1 and 2 standing in front of a pros and cons list)</p><p>Thought balloon 3: "Ok, so the left path has fewer obstacles, but it's longer and will take more time. The right path is shorter, but it has more obstacles and could be dangerous."</p><p></p><p>(stick figure 1 standing in front of a map)</p><p>Thought balloon 4: "I think the best decision would be to take the left path. It may take longer, but it's safer and we'll be able to avoid any potential hazards."</p><p></p><p>The key message in this illustration is that it's important to carefully consider all of the options before making a decision, and to weigh the pros and cons of each option. It's also important to think about the potential risks and benefits of each choice. By following these steps, it's possible to make sound, well-informed decisions.</p><br />
