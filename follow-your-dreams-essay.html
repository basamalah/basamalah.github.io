Activities included white-water rafting, horseback riding and all-day hiking trips on mountain peaks. I like being close to nature. I could hardly wait until March when my father arrives. 16. Mrs. Bertha Stevens was an aristocrat of Black Stamps. She had the grace of control to appear warm in the coldest weather and on the summer days, it seemed she had a private breeze which swirled around cooling her. She was thin yet lovely with her long curly hair and her printed violet dress and flowered hat. 17. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Fleming in 1928. Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various micro-organism and other living systems and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses, 18. Water is essential to human life. Man uses water for drinking and for cleansing himself, his food and the things he uses. Farmers use water for their farms. Every farmers knows that one of the effect of either inadequate or excessive water is poor harvest. Poor yield means less profit. If a farmer can have just enough water for his farm, neither too much nor too little, he can be sure to have the highest possible yield. 19. Logging is one of the country's top dollar earners. Millions of board feet of hard wood are exported yearly to Japan, the United States, Europe and the Middle East. As a result millions of dollars pour into the national treasury. Many forests are denuded. Life, property and crops are lost due to flush floods. 20. It is a garden, a lovely one. At the center is a fountain whose water flows a continuously day and night. Around the fountain is a cement boarder where plants are placed regular intervals. The plants are full of flowers. Bushes stand on all sides of the garden. Enclosi the garden is a high fence painted with white and brown.​</a>

He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story.

Write your answers in the space provided. PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE by I.V. Mallari There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like a bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.” The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that comes his way. Man-made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be PLIANT like the Bamboo.

He only cares about her appearance. Other men ask her to dance, but he doesn’t allow them; she has gone from being her father’s property to the property of the prince. She has no say in who she dances with. He doesn’t even know her name, so how much conversation can they have had?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewHAPPILY EVER AFTER?The only way out of her family home is marriage to the prince. He doesn’t even recognize her at first – her most distinguishing mark is her shoe size. He drives off with two other women first. He announces that he will marry the woman who fits the shoe – he doesn’t ask. Marriage is shown to be the great goal for a woman, the height of her happiness. But what about the next fifty years?Cinderella: A Feminist AnalysisReader viewYour HomeworkCreate your own feminist critique of one of the following two fairy tales: “The Briar Rose” or “The Little Snow White.” Write a thesis statement of the kind that began this presentation: “Cinderella, far from being an innocent fairy tale about a girl achieving her dreams is actually a misogynist story that presents women as greedy and cruel or pretty and passive, and suggests that the best way for a woman to get ahead in the world is to let herself be abused and wait for help from someone else.”Defend your thesis with some argumentation and examples from the story. This is not an essay. Simply write a SEEC paragraph of 6-10 sentences. No longer. Quality is more important than quantity here.Please pakisagotnaman maayosthank​</a>

Read the following example and answer the following questions: In today's society, the media influence everyone on how they should present themselves to the public. Thus, it also sets the standard of one's dream body. Any doctor, dietician, or nutritionist would say that the way to achieve this is just by simply eating healthier. People think that the way to eating healthier is to consume fewer fatty foods such as nuts, meat, oil and butter. Although fats contribute a lot to becoming overweight, several people do not realize that there are certain types of fat: some that are beneficial to one's well-being and some that are not. This essay will provide detailed information on the variety of fats known today, advantages and harms when consumed, and dissimilarity to other macronutrients specifically: carbohydrates and proteins (Montejo, 2013). 1.

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</a>

Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision. The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down. The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace. The Filipino is like a bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived. This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>How to achieve your dream house or home</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>Goal 1 – Create a positive mindset from start to finish<p>One of the key things to make your dream home a reality this year is keeping your energy and enthusiasm levels high from start to finish. Engage in completing your vision to nourish it, focus on it and protect your vision from opposing forces. Losing your motivation can affect how you commit to achieving your dream home. So make sure to be always enthusiastic and positive in claiming your dream house this year. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 2 – Start searching for the right home  <p>Either it is for starting a family or for retirement, you need to find the right property that will suit your needs. Ask yourself, is getting a two-storey house with 4 to 5 bedrooms practical when you’ll just be living alone? Or get a small bungalow or studio type house when you have a growing family with 3 to 4 kids? </p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 3 – Start saving for the down payment <p>You need to decide what amount you can comfortably afford. You can calculate the total home costs, mortgage, property taxes, and home insurance. You can start allocating a certain percentage from your income and set it aside for the initial payment. </p><p></p><p>Look for a group of passionate real estate agents to help you find the perfect home and can give you the utmost satisfaction. Remember this is your dream house and you can only deal with professional real estate experts that you can trust.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 4 – Start reserving your dream house<p>Once you found the perfect home for you and you know how much it would cost you, this is the perfect time to reserve the property. House and lot properties in Angeles City and Clark sell like pancakes. Meaning, they can be gone in an instant. That is why, when you already found the house you want to get and you have enough money for the down payment, don’t let the opportunity pass you by.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if you are renting right now, it is best to reserve the property that you want as soon as possible. This way, you can invest your money on the property that you can actually own instead of wasting it on rent. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 5 – Open a bank account solely for your dream home<p>Owning a home is really expensive. That is why you need to secure your savings. You can open a separate bank account that is solely for your dream home. Once you get your salary, transfer a portion of it to this account. Moreover, when you get extra money (bonus, raise, or extra side gig) put it here. This way you are securing enough money to fund your own home. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 6 – Start Spending Wisely <p>If you are short on money, don’t dip into your savings account that is meant for your dream house. Instead, reduce your expenses by at least 10 per cent. Or do Goal 7. </p><p></p><p> </p><p></p>Goal 7 – Find other sources of income<p>Owning a house and lot is a big deal and an expensive one. That is why you need to work harder to make sure you cover all the expenses needed. If you think your current salary won’t help you, better to find other sources of income to assist you in funding your dream home. It can be tough. But at the end of the day, you are paying for something that will be yours in the future. It’s just like another form of saving.</p><p></p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Just choose the important ones if you don't want write it all!</p><br />

1.This second trimester, you have added a lot of tek-bok writing to the entirety of your SHS study that you personally created for the Filipino Writing in Selected Fields course. It is now time to view or analyze your writings and evaluate yourself as a writer. Perform the following tasks (two parts) as part of your Expected Performance No.1 (P. T. # 1).
A. Part One: Choose THREE of your written essays in the Writing Filipino in Selected Fields (Tek-Bok) course that you would like to reflect on your writing experience. You need to compose a paragraph outlining your reflection on each of the writings you choose (because you need to choose three so in total there are three paragraphs). You can use and base the following questions to get ideas about the reflection you are going to write. However, each reflection must be in the form of a paragraph with a main idea. Make or write your reflection with an impact on the reader and not just answer the questions.
Why did you choose to write this?
What do you see as your strengths as a writer in this writing?
What important thing for you did you see when you wrote this article?
In what areas or parts of the writing did you have difficulty writing this essay?
If you were to further develop the writing of this essay, what would you do? Why?
 B. Part Two: Answering questions related to the topic: “Who Am I As A Writer?”. Answer the following questions as a reflection of your being a writer.
 1. Of the THREE writings you have chosen for your presented reflection or reflection on your writing experience, which one for you is your best work? Why?
 2. After looking at or evaluating your THREE writing choices, what do you see as your main strengths as a writer? Why?
 3. What do you think readers will learn about you (in dreams or purpose in life / in dealing with problems / in developing skills / in your personality or behavior / in expressing experiences, feelings, opinions , or outlook on life) from your tek-bok writing creations?

                            19. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

PLIANT LIKE A BAMBOO TREE
by I.V. Mallari
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not
being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind
to make the decision.
The wind blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. it would not yield. it knew it
was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But
finally, its roots gave way, and it stumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And
so, every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but it
lets the wind have its way. When finally, the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree
still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough to
resist the vigorous attack of superior forces. So, he yields and has survived.
This means that the Filipino would accept any kind of life that God would present
to him. For this reason, he is contented, happy and at peace. To him, as to that oriental
poet,” the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well – lived,
makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope.”
The Filipino is very resilient, he has the ability to recover from any obstacle that
comes his way. Man – made or natural forces, he emerges triumphantly. He never gives
up, no matter how hard life was before and even now… the FILIPINO remains to be
PLIANT like the Bamboo.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>A descriptive paragraph provides a vibrant experience for the reader through vivid language and descriptions of something. Unlike narrative paragraphs, which must include personal thoughts, feelings, and growth, descriptive paragraphs do not need to be personal in nature. Instead, descriptive paragraphs must focus on vividly and objectively describing something to the reader. In order to provide this vivid detail, the writer must use language that appeals to the reader’s five senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch. To appeal to these senses, the writer must use descriptive language, usually in the form of adjectives, that describes the sensations felt by the senses. For instance, examine the differences between the descriptions below:Sentence 1: The tree was tall and green.Sentence 2: The soft and damp pink flowers of the dogwood tree smelled sweet in the cool spring air as the wind whistled through its yellow-green leaves.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>plss </strong></p><p><strong>na </strong><strong>banned </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>kasi acc </strong><strong>ko</strong></p><br />
