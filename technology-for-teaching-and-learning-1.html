Elaborate the statements. 4.How does values developed and what influences its development? 5.Why Philippine Value system degrades as time passed by?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Values play a significant role in making a house into a home. They provide a sense of identity and belonging for the people who live there. A house that is infused with positive values creates a positive and nurturing environment for its inhabitants. On the other hand, a house that lacks values or has negative values can create a negative and toxic atmosphere. To make a house into a home, it is important to identify and cultivate values that align with one's personal beliefs and goals. These values should be reflected in the daily habits and routines of the people living in the home, as well as in the overall atmosphere and decor of the space.</p><p></p><p>2. Technology can change the way we communicate and interact with each other. It can also alter the way we access and share information. Some people may value convenience and efficiency over privacy.</p><p>Others may place a higher value on traditional ways of living. The impact of technology on values varies among individuals and societies.</p><p></p><p>3. Different children learn in different ways. Some may be visual learners, while others may be auditory learners. It is important to identify a child's learning style and tailor teaching methods accordingly. This can increase the child's engagement and understanding of the material. Failing to adapt to a child's learning style may result in frustration and decreased motivation.</p><p></p><p>4. Values can be influenced by family, culture, and life experiences. Early childhood experiences and role models can shape a person's values. Social interactions and group membership can also influence values. Personal goals and beliefs can also play a role in the development of values.</p><p>As a person grows and experiences new things, their values may change and evolve.</p><p></p><p>5. The Philippine Value system has degraded over time because of the increased influence of Western culture, the rise of materialism, the weakening of family relations, the rise of individualism, and the erosion of traditional values and beliefs. The traditional values that were once passed down from generation to generation have been replaced by the modern values of consumerism, materialism, and selfishness. The newer generation has embraced the values of instant gratification, convenience, and pleasure-seeking, which has caused them to neglect the importance of community, family and faith. Additionally, the lack of proper education and guidance for young people has also been a factor in the degradation of the Philippine Value system. Finally, the increasing influence of the media and social media has caused many to lose touch with their Filipino identity, which has further weakened the traditional values and beliefs of the country.</p><br />
