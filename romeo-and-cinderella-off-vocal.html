She wanted the Prince to meet Anastasia and Drizella. Maybe hewould marry one of them. Lady Tremaine kept Cinderella busy with chores that would take her allnight to finish.While Cinderella was working, the mice and birds fixed her dress. They added ribbons andbeads thatv the two stepsisters had thrown away. Working together, the animals turned a simpledress into a fabulous gown! Cinderella was overjoyed when she saw the dress. Now she could goto the ball! "Oh, thank you so much!" Cinderella said to Guz, Jaq, and the birds. They ripped thedress and pulled off the beads. Lady Tremaine didn't stop them. Cinderella's dream of going to theball was throughCinderella run away to the garden to cry. Suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared. With awave of her wand, she turned a pumpkin into an elegant coach. Cinderella could now go to the ball,but her dress was still ruined. "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!" said the Fairy Godmother, waving her wandagain. Cinderella was now wearing a beautiful gown and sparkling glass slippers. But all pof thiscame with a warning: When the clock struck midnight, the magic spell would wear off!At the ball, Prince Charming couldn't take his eyes off Cinderella.

Before too long, the clock began to strike midnight. "Good-bye!"Cinderella said, hurrying away."Come back!" called the Prince." I don't even know your name! As Cinderella fled, one of herglass slippers came off. Then Lady Tremaine tripped the Grand Duke, and the glass slippersshattered... but Cinderalla had other in her pocket. And if fit!

And the scene in which Cinderella blows soap bubbles—opalescent globes full of fragile reflections and rainbow colors—is one of the cleverest animations yet seen.

                            10. Cinderella household</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cinderella and Her Odious Household Chores</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but do people actually</p><p></p><p>think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was</p><p></p><p>not glamorous. She did everything from sweeping the floors to cooking the meals. If</p><p></p><p>someone had asked Cinderella which chores she did not particularly like, she probably</p><p></p><p>would have answered, “Why, none, of course. Housework is my duty!” In today’s</p><p></p><p>increasingly busy society, however, most people admit that they have definite dislikes</p><p></p><p>for certain household chores. The top three of these unpopular tasks often include</p><p></p><p>ironing clothes, washing dishes, and cleaning the bathroom.</p><p></p><p>One of the most hated chores for many people is ironing clothes because it is not</p><p></p><p>a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be</p><p></p><p>handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece</p><p></p><p>of clothing meticulously, which entails smoothing out the fabric, following the seams,</p><p></p><p>and getting the creases just right, it needs to be put on a hanger as soon as possible. If</p><p></p><p>not, this item might become wrinkled and need to be ironed again. Perhaps the reason</p><p></p><p>that ironing is not a favorite chore is that it requires extreme attention to detail from</p><p></p><p>beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Another household chore that many people dislike is washing dishes. Of course,</p><p></p><p>some people claim that this chore is no longer a problem because dishwashers are</p><p></p><p>available now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots</p><p></p><p>and pans washed in a dishwasher come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, many people continue to wash their dishes by hand, but they are not</p><p></p><p>necessarily happy doing it. Washing dishes is a dirty job that requires not only elbow</p><p></p><p>grease to scrape food off the dishes but also the patience to rinse and dry them. In</p><p></p><p>addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a chore that usually must be done</p><p></p><p>every day. Regardless of how Cinderella felt about this particular chore, it is obvious that</p><p></p><p>most people do not enjoy doing it.</p><p></p><p>Though ironing clothes and washing dishes are not the most pleasant household</p><p></p><p>chores, perhaps the most dreaded chore is cleaning the bathroom. This task involves</p><p></p><p>tackling three main areas: the bathtub, sink, and toilet. Because the bathroom is full of</p><p></p><p>germs, a quick wiping of the surface is not enough. As a result, strong bathroom</p><p></p><p>cleansers are necessary to clean and disinfect this room. The task of cleaning the</p><p></p><p>bathroom is so unpleasant that some people wear rubber gloves when they attempt it.</p><p></p><p>The only positive point about cleaning the bathroom is that it does not have to be done</p><p></p><p>on a daily basis.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining a house means doing a wide variety of unpleasant chores. Cinderella</p><p></p><p>knew this, and so does the rest of the world. Many individuals do not have the luxury of</p><p></p><p>hiring an outside person to do their own housework, so they must make do with their</p><p></p><p>own resources. Still, taking pride in the results of this hard work helps many people get</p><p></p><p>through the unpleasantness of these chores.</p><p></p><p>Note: This essay was adapted from the textbook Great Essays by Keith S.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Romeo and Juliet, written by William Shakespeare in the sixteenth century, is often considered one of the greatest love stories of all time. Similarly, the story of Cinderella is a well-known fairy tale that has been adapted numerous times and originated in the eighteenth century. Despite their differences in time frame and genre, both stories share similarities and differences in their characters, settings, and endings.</p><p></p><p>Time Frame: Romeo and Juliet is set in Verona, Italy, in the late fourteenth century, while Cinderella is set in a vague historical time period, often depicted as the eighteenth century.</p><p></p><p>Characters: Romeo and Juliet follows the tragic love story of two young lovers from rival families, while Cinderella tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters but finds happiness with the help of a fairy godmother. Both stories feature characters who are loyal, cunning, and deceitful.</p><p></p><p>Settings: The setting of Romeo and Juliet is predominantly in Verona, Italy, at the homes of the Capulet and Montagues, as well as public places such as the marketplace and the church. Cinderella is set in a magical kingdom, with castles, royal balls, and enchanted forests.</p><p></p><p>Endings: While both stories feature a happy ending, Romeo and Juliet's love is doomed from the start, and they both tragically die in each other's arms. In contrast, Cinderella marries the prince and lives happily ever after.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Romeo and Juliet and Cinderella share similarities and differences in time frame, characters, settings, and endings. Despite their differences in genre and historical context, both stories have become cultural touchstones, inspiring adaptations, and reimaginings for generations.</p><p></p><p><strong>F </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bernard </strong><strong>Rapiosa </strong><strong>Jr.</strong></p><br />

                            24. Critics on Cinderella?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>She is a diligent, hardworking and VERY kind (which is actually irritating) girl. Although it teaches people to be kind, in this modern world where there are a lot of abusers who like to take advantage of kind people, it is not really ideal. Yes it's important to be kind but it's important to have your limits and walk away from people and things that do not deserve you. However, my critic on Cinderella is not the story itself but of which the people have perpetuated an idea about how it is all about finding a Prince Charming. She just wanted to have a good time outside from that hellhole. She just happened to meet a Prince who fell in love with her and she basically ends up as a Princess. That's good karma right there. </p><p></p><br />
