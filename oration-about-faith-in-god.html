                        Mom, my older sister was in a car accident and she’s at the Military District General Hospital in emergency care. The doctor said … he said that her injuries are really severe and they may not be able to save her. He said her family should get to the hospital as soon as possible and make preparations….” My youngest daughter was breaking down in tears over the phone. My legs suddenly went completely weak and I nearly fainted; tears streamed down my face and I felt like I had been stabbed through the heart. Just how badly was my daughter injured? How could I go on living if I lost her at such a young age? In the midst of my pain it occurred to me that since I’m a believer, I had to pray and lean on God—I knew He would certainly help and guide me.<br /><br />I immediately kneeled down in prayer to God: “Almighty, one true God! Absolutely everything is in Your hands—my daughter’s life is also in Your hands. She’s been in such a terrible car accident today, and I’m leaving up to You whether she lives or dies, whether she’ll be able to go on living. I will submit to Your rule and arrangements. Amen!” After praying a passage of God’s words sprung to mind. “Who of the whole of mankind is not cared for in the eyes of the Almighty? Who does not live in the midst of the Almighty’s predestination? Does man’s life and death happen by his own choice? Does man control his own fate? Many people cry out for death, yet it is far away from them; many people want to be those who are strong in life and fear death, yet unbeknownst to them, the day of their demise draws near, plunging them into the abyss of death; many people look to the skies and sigh deeply; many people cry great, wailing sobs; many people fall amidst trials; and many people become prisoners of temptation” (“Chapter 11” of God’s Words to the Entire Universe). It’s true! God created mankind and He also rules over and has in His grasp the fates of all people. Life or death, changes in fortune are all in God’s hands, and so was the fate of my daughter. God’s words strengthened my faith and gave me something to lean on, and so the nervousness and pain in my heart eased considerably. I shifted my mindset and got ready to go to the hospital. Just then my younger daughter called me again and said excitedly, “Mom, she’s finally regained consciousness!” Hearing this, I knew it was God’s great power and I thanked Him over and over again in my heart. I also saw that when I was resolute in my faith and was willing to accept and submit to God’s orchestrations and arrangements, to put my daughter in God’s hands, I saw His deeds. A feeling welled up within me. When faced with a situation like this, there’s something that I need to experience and I should pray and rely on God; through that experience I should seek the truth and learn a lesson.<br /><br />True Stories of Faith in God, God Saved My Daughter From Death<br /><br />When I got to the hospital I saw my daughter lying in the hospital bed—her entire body was bandaged with just her swollen head sticking out, and her once-radiant eyes were open just a slit. I was stunned for a good while and I couldn’t hold back the tears from welling up and flowing out. With great effort she was able to feebly say, “Mom!” Tears fell from the corners of her eyes. Seeing my daughter that terribly injured was so painful for me.<br /><br />My younger daughter later told me that her sister had been on a bus at the time of the accident. She had been sitting in the front seat next to the driver when that vehicle and another long-distance bus suddenly collided. She was thrown out through the glass window and just as she was hitting the ground the bus overturned on top of her. One of the front wheels crushed her left hip from the rear. At the time the people on the scene were just dealing with the people inside of the bus and had no idea that there was someone under the bus’s wheel. By the time she was discovered and gotten out from under there she had been burned black by the scalding hot oil leaking out of the gas tank, and only then was she rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. Hearing all of this was terrifying—my daughter had very nearly met her end!<br /><br />Seeing my daughter with burns all over her body really pained me. I was even more distressed when I learned that the doctor had surgically removed some of her burned skin and the bone had even been exposed in some places. However, I also knew that it was out of my hands—all I could do was silently pray to God and ask Him to give my daughter strength and faith.<br /><br />The next day it just so happened that some specialists from a well-regarded hospital were coming to the hospital for a consultation. They looked at my daughter and gave the following assessment: a fracture in her left back, skin would need to be grafted, the smaller joint on her right index finger was completely burnt and <br />

                            8. What is the difference between faithfulness to God and faithfulness of God?</h2><br />
                        In my opinion, faithfulness to God means being faithful to God... We must show God that we are faithful to Him while faithfulness of God means God being faithful to all of us...We can see that God is faithful and His word is true. God is so faithful that who ever seeks Him can find Him. The <strong>faithfulness </strong>that matters most is us showing <strong>faithfulness </strong>towards God.<strong></strong><br /><br /><br />The difference between faithfullness to God and faithfullness of God is that faithfullness to God means His creation being faithful to Him while faithfullness of God means God being faithful to His creation.<br />

                        One of God's main jobs is making people. He makes them to replace the ones that die, so there will be enough people to take care of things on earth. He doesn't make grown-ups, just babies. I think because they are smaller and easier to make. That way He doesn't have to take up His valuable time teaching them to talk and walk. He can just leave that to the mothers and fathers. <br /><br />God's second most important job is listening to prayers. An awful lot of this goes on, since some people, like preachers and things, pray at times beside bedtime. God doesn't have time to listen to the radio or TV because of this. <br /><br />God sees everything and hears everything and is everywhere, which keeps Him pretty busy. So you shouldn't go wasting His time by going over your Mom and Dad's head asking for something they said you couldn't have. <br /><br />Atheists are people who don't believe in God. I don't think there are any in my town. At least there aren't any who come to our church. <br /><br />Jesus is God's Son. He used to do all the hard work like walking on water and performing miracles and people finally got tired of Him preaching to them and they crucified Him. But He was good and kind, like His Father, and He told His Father that they didn't know what they were doing and to forgive them and God said, "O.K." <br /><br />His Dad (God) appreciated everything that He had done and all His hard work on earth so He told Him He didn't have to go out on the road anymore. He could stay in heaven. So He did. And now He helps His Dad out by listening to prayers and seeing things which are important for God to take care of and which ones He can take care of Himself without having to bother God. (Like a secretary, only more important.) You can pray anytime you want and they are sure to help you because they got it worked out so one of them is on duty all the time. <br /><br />You should always go to church on Sunday because it makes God happy, and if there's anybody you want to make happy, it's God. Don't skip church to do something you think will be more fun like going to the beach. This is wrong. And besides, the sun doesn't come out at the beach until noon anyway. <br /><br />If you don't believe in God, besides being an atheist, you will be very lonely, because your parents can't go everywhere with you, like to camp, but God can. It is good to know He's around you when you're scared in the dark or when you can't swim and big kids throw you into real deep water. <br /><br />But…you shouldn't just always think of what God can do for you. I figure God put me here and He can take me back anytime He pleases. <br /><br />And…that's why I believe in God.<br />

3. Faith life and social life are inseparable.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explain the following statements on Christian faith.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Faith is a personal relationship with God.
</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the bible without faith it is impossible to please God. So in order to please Him and have a close relationship with Him, we must believe that He exists and He loves to those who follow His word. A strong foundation of faith comes from the word of God. Faith produces hope and a strong relationship with our creator. Having faith with God means we allow Him to work in our lives.
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Faith is a life-long task about knowing God more personally.
</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, very truly, Faith is not just for now, it should be consistent and long term as we serve our living God. To know His characteristics, we must also increase our faith with Him. The more we have faith with God, the more He releases the power and make the impossible things to possible one. God is powerful and loving God, He deserves all the glory and adoration.  
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p><strong>3. Faith life and social life are inseparable.</strong></p><p>Yes, Because, we need to tell others about our faith to God, We need to share with others about Jesus. If we know the truth, it should not keep for ourselves. It should freely give to those people who have problems in life, to those hopeless one, to those who do not believe God. We should tell that Jesus loves us and He lives for us to have eternal life.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1st: In my opinion, the bible is about God because in the old testaments it talks about the coming of the Messiah and the new testaments talk about the life of Jesus from 4 different points of views.</p><p>2nd: It talks about humanity because the life of our ancestors are written there, on how they lived, what they did, how they act.</p><p>Lastly: It talks about our response of faith because God said whoever believes in his words shall have eternal life.

                        <strong>DEFINITION</strong><p></p><p>Trusting <strong>God</strong> is an essential element of true and saving faith that looks to God and finds peace, strength, contentment, and much more in him, and all that he has done, is doing, and will do, both now and forever in his Son Jesus Christ.</p><p></p><strong>SUMMARY </strong><strong>(</strong><strong>Speech)</strong><p></p><p>In this chapter we look at what it means to trust God by observing how trust relates to saving faith. Then we will trace how trust grows out of a knowledge of God, his promises, and his actions. We conclude by looking at some biblical examples of trust and how it should manifest itself in our lives as Christians.</p><p></p><p>Trusting God is one of those truths we think we understand until we are called upon to do it, and then we discover that there is more to it than we realized. Trusting God is an aspect of saving faith which has been said to have three elements to it: knowledge, assent, and trust (cf. John Gill, Body of Divinity, vol. 1 [Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1978], 411). All three aspects go together, but without trust, faith is inadequate and shockingly indistinguishable from the faith of demons who believe and shudder before God, yet do not repent and surrender themselves to him (Jas. 2:19 cf. Ps. 78:22). Trusting God is essential to Christian life. This, however, does not mean it is easy to trust God, especially in a world that questions the sanity of trusting him at almost every turn. Nevertheless, trust God we must, and the Bible has much to say that will help us no matter what our circumstances.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>you have many more to answer that</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>THEOLOGY</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Theology is the systematic study of the nature of the divine and, more broadly, of religious belief. It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities and seminaries.[1] It occupies itself with the unique content of analyzing the supernatural, but also deals with religious epistemology, asks and seeks to answer the question of revelation. Revelation pertains to the acceptance of God, gods, or deities, as not only transcendent or above the natural world, but also willing and able to interact with the natural world and, in particular, to reveal themselves to humankind. While theology has turned into a secular field, religious adherents still consider theology to be a discipline that helps them live and understand concepts such as life and love and that helps them lead lives of obedience to the deities they follow or worship.</p><br />
