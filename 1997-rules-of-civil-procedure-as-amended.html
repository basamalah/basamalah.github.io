                            4. Does ‘politics’ refer to a particular way in which rules are made, preserved or amended, or to all such processes?</h2><br />
                        <p>There are quite many definition of politics. But to answer the question does ‘politics’ refer to a particular way in which rules are made, preserved or amended, or to all such processes?
</p><p><strong>The answer is, yes. Politics refers to a set of activities associated with the governance of a country, or an area in which rules are made, preserved, amended, and processed. </strong>It involves making decisions that apply to members of a group which is vital in achieving and exercising positions of governance—organized control over a human community, particularly a state. The academic study is termed Political Science (or sometime politicology) which deals all political processes involving human beings as political animals, state and government.  Political Science also deals with the concepts of governance, power, influence, legitimacy, perception, attitude, values, public opinion, decision-making, and groups and their activities.  </p><p><strong>The Meaning of Politics:
</strong></p><p>Politics had its etymology from a Greek word polis means city-states. City-states of Ancient Greece were independent political entities of which Sparta and Athens were the most prominent. Thus politics is associated with the activities related to the “government” of the state. The following are theorists offer different definition of what politics is:
</p>Karl Marx, defined politics as “ceaseless struggle for power”
David Easton, viewed politics as “authoritative allocation of values which are binding the society”
Harold Lasswell, defined politics as “who gets what, when and how”
<p>Throughout the history of the discipline, political theorists and practitioners have offered multiple, at times contradictory and overlapping definitions of what politics involves. It is therefore difficult (if not impossible) to provide a single definition of politics that everyone can agree on. The best we can do is to explore some of the themes of politics of which could help us develop some sort of framework, and in some way of organizing these definitions.
</p><p><strong>Themes of Politics:
</strong></p>Politics as a form of political organization
Politics as an academic discipline
Politics as a nature of political right
Politics as a global pattern
Politics as a political power
<p>In the modern day usage, politics denotes a process in the societal system in which the goals of that system are selected and ordered in terms of priority in the allocation of resources. Individuals, groups or institutions authorized to formulate and implement policies and programs in behalf of the rest of the members of the society do the allocation of resources through authoritative decisions.
</p><p>Thus, as we explore the broader concepts of politics, it is necessary to first understand its basic foundations, learn more about its functions, get political news from high-quality sources, and consider the impact of politics on our lives.

                        If you are a legislator. What rules or laws that currently prohibit certain acts or practices would you want to amend or repeal?
<p>
</p><strong>Subsidies</strong> - Eliminate all government subsidies in the private sector, including agriculture and oil production.
<strong>Self Defense</strong> - Eliminate thousands of conflicting standards and limitations on the ownership, carriage and usage of firearms. Eliminate all individual state and local regulations on handguns in favour of a single federal requirement. This will be a simple and literal interpretation of the second amendment as written. All legal adults (all non-Fellows 18 and over) can keep AND bear arms, even when crossing state lines, moving, in their homes and on their own. The same is valid of complex and convoluted knife laws.
<strong>Transportation</strong> - Individual state-to-state car regulations for vehicles, emission controls and driver legislation can be uniform at the federal level. Any conditions should not become a financial burden on people or households using their cars.
<strong>Standardized Ages</strong> - Age for activities like drinking, smoking, driving, sex or firearm purchases should be standard across state lines to avoid confrontation as a person moves across the country.
<strong>Property Taxes</strong> - They can stay set as long as the existing owner holds the land. They can only be reassessed whether the property is sold or moved.
<p>
</p><strong>Energy Policy</strong> - Allow the market to decide the type of energy to be sold and used. No government incentives to push one type of energy use over another.
<p>
</p><strong>Illegal Immigration</strong> - Build a wall and guard the southern boundary.
<strong>Legal Immigration </strong>- Simplify and streamline the complicated, long and costly immigration policy. Whether people are going to sneak in and work under the bench, throw them out. If they come here to find jobs, pay their fair share and contribute to society, make it easy for them to do so.
<strong>Affirmative Action</strong> - Eliminate all discrimination based on race or gender in jobs, schooling or housing by NOT granting preferential benefits to someone regardless of their skin color or sex.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>techniques	 that	are	likely	 different	 from	 those	 you	 used	in	 previous	educational	 settings.	
</p><p>Moreover,	even	within	law	school,	different	courses	may	require	different	approaches.
</p><p>One	learning	technique	that	has	traditionally	been	fundamental	to	law	school	is	applying	the	
</p><p>“Socratic	method”	to	judicial	opinions.	Under	this	methodology,	students	read	cases,	usually	
</p><p>appellate	cases,	with	the	professor	then	asking	questions	about	the	cases.	The	questions	are	
</p><p>designed	 to	 draw	 out	 the	 important	 principles	 and	 the	 underlying	 policies	 and	 tensions.	
</p><p>Although	learning	to	read	cases	is	an	extremely	important,	if	not	essential,	skill	to	acquire	in	
</p><p>your	first	year	of	law	school,	it	can	also	be	an	inefficient	way	to	learn	the	substantive	concepts	
</p><p>embedded	in	the	cases.
</p><p>Civil	Procedure	is	different	from	most	first	year	classes,	in	that	substantial	portions	of	the	
</p><p>class	are	based	on	codified	rules,	not	just	case	law.	Accordingly,	this	book	takes	a	different	
</p><p>approach.	As	part	of	the	Learning	Series,	this	book	de-emphasizes	cases	and	focuses	more	
</p><p>on	 explanation	 and	 short	 hypotheticals,	 illustrations,	 or	 problems.	 The	 vision	
</p><p>behind Learning	 Civil	 Procedure is	 that	 because	 Civil	 Procedure	 is	 in	 significant	 measure	
</p><p>based on	codified	rules,	it	is	preferable	to	teach	it	by	explaining	the	concepts,	then	allowing	
</p><p>students	 to	explore	 the	 contours	and	 parameters	 of	 those	 concepts	 through	 studying	 the	
</p><p>rules	 and	 illustrative	 examples,	 rather	 than	 distilling	 the	 concepts	 from	 cases.	
</p><p>Notwithstanding	the	de-emphasis	of	cases,	there	are	times	when	the	study	of	cases	may	be	
</p><p>the	 optimal	learning	 tool.	 In	addition,	 there	are	 some	 classic,	 key,	 or	 famous	 cases	 that	a	
</p><p>literate	lawyer	 should	 know.	 Consequently,	 this	 book	 at	 times	includes	 case	 excerpts	 for	
</p><p>study.
</p><p>Civil	 Procedure	 is	 also	 an	 opportunity	 to	 focus	 on	 how	 to	 read	 and	 construe	 statutory	
</p><p>language,	 another	 critical	 skill	 for	lawyers	in	 almost	 every	 discipline.	Accordingly,	 rather	
</p><p>than	refer	you	to	a	supplement,	this	book	sets	forth	the	key	language	of	major	Federal	Civil	
</p><p>Rules	and	important	procedural	statutes	in	text.	So	while	you	try	to	develop	and	hone	your	
</p><p>skills	in	reading	cases	in	your	other	classes,	you	can	focus	on	reading	statutory	language	in	
</p><p>this	class.	As	you	analyze	the	cases,	statutes	and	rules	presented	throughout	this	book,	you	
</p><p>also	should	begin	to	assess	the	overall	 fairness	and	efficiency	of	the	American	civil	justice	
</p><p>system.

                        <p><strong>Renaissance is an era of revival of modern civilization in Europe after experiencing a dark age. During the dark age or gloomy times, science in Europe seemed to run in place because it was limited by the church. </strong>In addition to being limited by the church, Europe's gloomy period that took place before the 14th century made culture and science undeveloped. Until finally the thinkers tried to explore new ideas by studying various sciences from Ancient Rome, Ancient Greece or the Ottoman empire to be modified, and then the Renaissance era was born.</p><p><strong>The emergence of the Renaissance era became a milestone in the rise of modern civilization in Europe. </strong>The Renaissance movement began in the 14th century in Italy and then spread throughout Europe. Art is one of the most influential sectors in this era. In addition, the development of ways of thinking and philosophy is no less popular in this era. The Renaissance period also gave rise to a number of artists with phenomenal works such as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo and many more. As time went by, Europe began to become the mecca of world education. The revival of philosophy in Europe gave birth to prominent figures and well-known universities in Europe which became a new era of scientific development.</p><p>Quality human resources enable countries in the European continent to optimally cultivate their potential. So, it can be concluded that the distribution of developed countries is mostly found on the European continent due to historical aspects, climate, and the quality of human resources.<strong> Currently Europe has a very significant impact on the world order because it is the center of the entertainment industry, technological developments and the driving force of the world economy. Countries such as Britain, Germany and France are countries that also have quite influential political power in the world.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Learn More About :</strong></p><p>How does civilization affects the international order and rule https://brainly.ph/question/25917371</p><p>#SPJ4</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>When a Representative has written a bill, the bill needs a sponsor. The Representative talks with other Representatives about the bill in hopes of getting their support for it. Once a bill has a sponsor and the support of some of the Representatives, it is ready to be introduced. In the U.S. House of Representatives, a bill is introduced when it is placed in the hopper—a special box on the side of the clerk’s desk. Only Representatives can introduce bills in the U.S. House of Representatives. When a bill is introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, a bill clerk assigns it a number that begins with H.R. A reading clerk then reads the bill to all the Representatives, and the Speaker of the House sends the bill to one of the House standing committees. When the bill reaches committee, the committee members—groups of Representatives who are experts on topics such as agriculture, education, or international relations—review, research, and revise the bill before voting on whether or not to send the bill back to the House floor. If the committee members would like more information before deciding if the bill should be sent to the House floor, the bill is sent to a subcommittee. While in subcommittee, the bill is closely examined and expert opinions are gathered before it is sent back to the committee for approval. When the committee has approved a bill, it is sent—or reported—to the House floor. Once reported, a bill is ready to be debated by the U.S. House of Representatives. When a bill is debated, Representatives discuss the bill and explain why they agree or disagree with it. Then, a reading clerk reads the bill section by section and the Representatives recommend changes. When all changes have been made, the bill is ready to be voted on. There are three methods for voting on a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives:</p><p>Viva Voce (voice vote): The Speaker of the House asks the Representatives who support the bill to say “aye” and those that oppose it say “no.”</p><p>Division: The Speaker of the House asks those Representatives who support the bill to stand up and be counted, and then those who oppose the bill to stand up and be counted.</p><p>Recorded: Representatives record their vote using the electronic voting system. Representatives can vote yes, no, or present (if they don’t want to vote on the bill).</p><p>If a majority of the Representatives say or select yes, the bill passes in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill is then certified by the Clerk of the House and delivered to the U.S. Senate.</p><p>When a bill reaches the U.S. Senate, it goes through many of the same steps it went through in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill is discussed in a Senate committee and then reported to the Senate floor to be voted on.</p><p></p><p>Senators vote by voice. Those who support the bill say “yea,” and those who oppose it say “nay.” If a majority of the Senators say “yea,” the bill passes in the U.S. Senate and is ready to go to the President. </p><p>When a bill reaches the President, he has three choices. He can:</p><p></p><p>Sign and pass the bill—the bill becomes a law.</p><p>Refuse to sign, or veto, the bill—the bill is sent back to the U.S. House of Representatives, along with the President’s reasons for the veto. If the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate still believe the bill should become a law, they can hold another vote on the bill. If two-thirds of the Representatives and Senators support the bill, the President’s veto is overridden and the bill becomes a law.</p><p>Do nothing (pocket veto)—if Congress is in session, the bill automatically becomes law after 10 days. If Congress is not in session, the bill does not become a law.</p><p>If a bill has passed in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and has been approved by the President, or if a presidential veto has been overridden, the bill becomes a law and is enforced by the government.</p><p>A recommittal motion usually offers a final opportunity to amend a bill or joint resolution before the House votes on passing it. The amending process on the floor of the House of Representatives gives Members an opportunity to change the provisions of the bills and resolutions on which they are going to vote.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> Affirmative Action - Eliminate all discrimination based on race or gender in jobs, schooling or housing by NOT granting preferential benefits to someone regardless of their skin color or sex.Illegal Immigration - Build a wall and guard the southern boundary.Energy Policy - Allow the market to decide the type of energy to be sold and used. No government incentives to push one type of energy use over another.Standardized Ages - Age for activities like drinking, smoking, driving, sex or firearm purchases should be standard across state lines to avoid confrontation as a person moves across the country.Property Taxes - They can stay set as long as the existing owner holds the land. They can only be reassessed whether the property is sold or moved.Subsidies - Eliminate all government subsidies in the private sector, including agriculture and oil production.Transportation - Individual state-to-state car regulations for vehicles, emission controls and driver legislation can be uniform at the federal level. Any conditions should not become a financial burden on people or households using their cars.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sorry yan lang alam ko eh^^</p><p>correct me if i'm wrong.</p><br />

                        DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER AND RULE FROM EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION<p>      Although International Order and Rule did not stem from European Civilization, it still has a great contribution to its development.</p><p>      International humanitarian law represents the creation and eventual development of a world order based almost entirely on the concept that autonomous sovereign states are the sole important participants in the international system.</p><p>     The basic framework of international law was established during the European Renaissance, although its beginnings may be traced back to mutual cooperation among persons inside the medieval Middle East.</p><p></p><p><strong>During the Roman Empire, many of the principles that now govern the international legal order were formed.</strong></p><p>     It is possible to say that international law originated in 1648 with the Treaty of Westphalia, which established nations' sovereign equality. The Geneva Conventions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries defined rules surrounding the conduct of war (jus ad bellum and jus in bello).</p><p></p>Contribution of the French to Human Rights Rule<p>    The Proclamation of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen arose in the summer of 1789 from the intention of the Constituent Assembly, created by the assembly of the States General, to prepare a new Constitution and to precede it with a declaration of principles.</p><p>    The proposals are flooding in. The Constituent Assembly tasked five deputies, Démeunier, La Luzerne, Tronchet, Mirabeau, and Redon, with reviewing the draft statements, combining them into one, and presenting them to the Assembly.

                        <p><strong>If you are a legislator. What rules or laws that currently prohibit certain acts or practices would you want to amend or repeal?</strong></p>Subsidies - Eliminate all government subsidies in the private sector, including agriculture and oil production.Self Defense - Eliminate thousands of conflicting standards and limitations on the ownership, carriage and usage of firearms. Eliminate all individual state and local regulations on handguns in favour of a single federal requirement. This will be a simple and literal interpretation of the second amendment as written. All legal adults (all non-Fellows 18 and over) can keep AND bear arms, even when crossing state lines, moving, in their homes and on their own. The same is valid of complex and convoluted knife laws.Transportation - Individual state-to-state car regulations for vehicles, emission controls and driver legislation can be uniform at the federal level. Any conditions should not become a financial burden on people or households using their cars.Standardized Ages - Age for activities like drinking, smoking, driving, sex or firearm purchases should be standard across state lines to avoid confrontation as a person moves across the country.Property Taxes - They can stay set as long as the existing owner holds the land. They can only be reassessed whether the property is sold or moved.Energy Policy - Allow the market to decide the type of energy to be sold and used. No government incentives to push one type of energy use over another.Illegal Immigration - Build a wall and guard the southern boundary.Legal Immigration - Simplify and streamline the complicated, long and costly immigration policy. Whether people are going to sneak in and work under the bench, throw them out. If they come here to find jobs, pay their fair share and contribute to society, make it easy for them to do so.Affirmative Action - Eliminate all discrimination based on race or gender in jobs, schooling or housing by NOT granting preferential benefits to someone regardless of their skin color or sex.Education - The national minimum standards for public education should be adopted, replacing all varying local and state standards. Home education and private colleges are eligible as long as they follow the same minimum standards.Welfare - Reduction of welfare by 10% per month to offer incentives for claimants to find jobs and support themselves.<br />
