In my early childhood, I learnt the alphabet at 4 and at theage of 5 I learnt to write and read. At a young age, Jose Rizal had always shown atendency towards the arts. His family was fascinated by his pencil paintings, sketches,and clay moldings. Later  in his  youth,  he displayed a special talent  in  painting  and drawing,  wrote a Tagalog  play,   which   was   presented   at  the   Calamba   Festival,   andpenned a short Spanish play, which was presented at the school. At my young age,without a care in the world, I enjoyed my childhood outside playing traditional Filipinogames such as patintero, tumbang preso, piko, sipa, turumpo, langit-lupa, taguan, andmany others. That’s where I grew up. I’m not book-smart like Jose Rizal, I’m just astreet-smart rascal back then.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps?(^^)</p><br />
