This research determined the perception toward online education among faculty in a State College in the Philippines. This study used a descriptive online survey involving a sample of 27 faculty members. Statistical tools employed were descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Research findings indicated that the majority of faculty had intermediate computer competency and had no training in online teaching with only a few having a very stable internet connection. Faculty considered that online education will result to more academic dishonesty, will be impersonal and lack feeling compared to face-to-face classes, and will be difficult to manage in terms of technology. Additionally, faculty were undecided if they are in favor of online education. The faculty significantly differed whether they are in favor of online education based on age, sex, college, educational attainment, years in teaching, academic rank, level taught and employment status. Faculty of Higher Education Institutions must be provided with continued support and training as they adapt into the new normal in the higher education landscape and as they embrace the instructional challenges brought by the Coronavirus disease 19 pandemic.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning in the new normal is a challenge for the teachers, students and even parents. After postponing the opening of online classes last August 24, DepEd now confirms that they are ready for October’s opening of classes, for the school year 2020 to 2021, through blended learning approaches after reaching more than 23 million enrollees. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Blended learning is a combination of both online and offline learning methodologies with the use of technology. Online is when the students study with their teacher and classmates through an application that uses a webcam while offline is when the teacher provides the students with the lesson, seatwork or assignment that they can finish at their own pace, within the deadline. All works are submitted and graded via online. </p><p></p><p>This new way of learning brought by COVID-19 pandemic can be an additional challenge during this tough time. And since going back to the “normal” we’re all accustomed to isn’t going to happen anytime soon, let’s all do the best we could to adjust and make this current situation work. Remember, the goal of online learning is to keep the students engaged academically in order to retain what they have learned</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>THE </strong><strong>EDUCATION</strong><strong> </strong><strong>IN </strong><strong>THE </strong><strong>NEW </strong><strong>NORMAL</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Improving learning outcomes is one of the most straightforward effects of online education on children's recovery. Online learning allows students to learn at their own pace and in their own environment. Students are less likely to miss classes when they can take them from home or another location of their choosing.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>It's been over a year since the still-active COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on daily life. The country's education system is one of the institutions that has been severely impacted. In order to ensure that learners' needs are not overlooked in this so-called new normal, the Department of Education (DepEd) has implemented a series of changes that have now been dubbed "blended learning."</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>It's been over a year since the still-active COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on daily life. The country's education system is one of the institutions that has been severely impacted. In order to ensure that learners' needs are not overlooked in this so-called new normal, the Department of Education (DepEd) has implemented a series of changes that have now been dubbed "blended learning."Although not a new concept, nothing about its implementation in the Philippines has been that simple.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Blended learning, a pseudo-virtual approach, combines two types of alternative education options into a "blend" to better serve students who have been forced to stay at home due to the pandemic. According to a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey released in March 2021, 89 percent of Filipino families with members enrolled for school year 2020-21 consider blended learning to be "more difficult" than the traditional face-to-face setup.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>This pandemic has drastically altered the educational landscape, exposing both old and new challenges such as the digital divide (Altbach and De Wit, 2020; HESB, 2020) — a term coined to describe a lack of appropriate gadgets, internet inaccessibility, teachers' "learning by doing set-up," and other hybrid online opportunities. According to preliminary data, approximately 6.9 million Filipino underprivileged students have unstable mobile and internet connections, while 6.8 million have no device at all (as cited by Mateo, 2020).</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>But </strong><strong>Did you know that there are so many suicide cases because of the online class, it is not only caused by the difficult situation today in the current pandemic, it is also caused by stress, depression, </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Anxiety.</strong></p><p><strong>Many students are already having difficulty with online </strong><strong>classes </strong><strong>and others are no longer studying to learn, just studying to get a high grade. </strong><strong>But even so, we continue to fight because the future depends on us.</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>what's</strong><strong> </strong><strong>more?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The shift to online learning has implications not only for teachers, who must modify their courses, but also for students, who must adjust to the new learning environment. Educators and parents are taking notice, and many are wondering whether the transition to online education will result in long-term changes for students who leave the classroom. One of the most significant consequences of the shift to online learning is the effect it has on students' health and sleeping habits.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Online learning is expanding at the same rate as it was prior to COVID-19, with one-third of postsecondary students taking at least one online class and 30% of graduate students studying online. Another advantage of online education is that students can attend classes from wherever they want. It also enables schools to reach a large number of students without being limited by geographical boundaries.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>if for you it's too long, you can just take another part here and copy so you don't have a hard time ^^</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Department of Education, as a way of adhering to the current state of students amidst the pandemic, implemented various means. This, in accordance with the 1967 constitution, is stated in Article XIV, Section 1 and 2. For this reason, flexible learning options (FLO's) come into great use. An example of this is the online class, which is prevalent among various schools at any level. They are, as well, using self-learning modules (SLM's), which are mentioned in DepEd order No.18 of yesteryear and used by DepEd for its Alternative Delivery Modes (ADM), which do not follow the typical set-up of a classroom but still align with the K-12 curriculum in context.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Department of Education (DepEd) announced on Monday, June 8 of the year 2020 , said it would postpone face-to-face classes until a vaccine against COVID-19 becomes available. Aside from these methods for sustaining learning, issues began to resurface after that. A research paper by Zamira Hyseni Duraku, et al confirms that social isolation and the new circumstances created by the spread of COVID-19, including changes in education, have caused a number of concerns for children, parents, and teachers in Kosovo. Which also influenced by the inadequacy of the methods used for online learning to the individual needs of students (UNESCO, 2020a).</p><p></p><p></p><p>As a student, education in this new normal is way more difficult than in the mortar and brick setting. I often experienced intermittent internet service, especially during online classes, as well as environmental noise, which really distracted me during recitation. Modules provide written instructions and lessons for us; however, it has never been sufficient, and it pales in comparison to school, where teachers can really elaborate on the lesson.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Reference:</p><p></p><p>DepEd order no.18 2020</p><p></p><p></p><p>https://www.deped.gov.ph/2021/08/25/deped-reaches-8-5m-enrollees-as-enhanced-remote-enrollment-adopted-for-sy-2021-2022/</p><p></p><p></p><p>https://www.rappler.com/nation/deped-postpones-face-to-face-classes-covid-19-vaccine-available</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic: Common Diseases During the Rainy Season .</p><p></p><p>Rainy season is the most awaited season in the entire year. It is the most beautiful and wonderful season of the year. It not just brings relief from summer but it brings joy and happiness into your life.</p><p></p><p>When you walk down the roads you’ll find fewer pedestrians, traffic, and puddles fill the streets.Most of the things that you have done, games that you have played, or the smell of the wet soil during rain stays forever in your memory.</p><p></p><p>But you will never want to ruin it by falling sick right!</p><p></p><p>So here are some of the common diseases during this monsoon</p><p></p><p>Common Monsoon Diseases :Influenza :</p><p>The common cold is very common during monsoon.

This disease is spread by the female Anopheles mosquito. During the rainy season, there is a lot of chances that the water gets stagnant in all the possible places and it provides a place for mosquitoes to breed and spread the disease.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Descriptive: Self-Learning Modules</p><p>            Self learning modules were now the main way of learning for students to attend school. It tests our prior knowledge and tests our way of understanding. Though many now are hardly learning due to lack of understanding and guidance of parents or teachers. Some may finish easily just by reading but most are suffering from unexplained, in an easier way, explanations.</p><p>            Some lessons or subjects also needs resources like the internet where students find their research easily. But others doesn't always have that kind of resource so they tend to find ways, like asking from others. If not, they just do certain options to think of another way in doing so. Though the internet is helpful, it can also be a drag down from learning, and delayer of schedule. It has many things to distract learners from, for the media is a worldwide website.</p><p>           As these things happen, modular learning always have ways and answers inside for the questions to be answered. Hard it may seem but if ones determination of studying is very strong, concentration and focusness are met. Modular learning is meant to test us in our ways of thinking and learning to adapt to the situation and environment that we are unfamiliar with.

This research determined the perception toward online education among faculty in a State College in the Philippines. This study used a descriptive online survey involving a sample of 27 faculty members. Statistical tools employed were descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Research findings indicated that the majority of faculty had intermediate computer competency and had no training in online teaching with only a few having a very stable internet connection. Faculty considered that online education will result to more academic dishonesty, will be impersonal and lack feeling compared to face-to-face classes, and will be difficult to manage in terms of technology. Additionally, faculty were undecided if they are in favor of online education. The faculty significantly differed whether they are in favor of online education based on age, sex, college, educational attainment, years in teaching, academic rank, level taught and employment status. Faculty of Higher Education Institutions must be provided with continued support and training as they adapt into the new normal in the higher education landscape and as they embrace the instructional challenges brought by the Coronavirus disease 19 pandemic.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Philippine COVID-19 Response
<p>
</p><p>It was December 31, 2019. People all over the world are optimistic about the year 2020 because it brings in a new decade. However, in Wuhan, China, dozens of people are mysteriously dying from pneumonia.
</p><p>
Three months later, the whole world is on a lockdown, and the number of infected kept on rising. The World Health Organization decided to name this new disease as <strong>COVID-19</strong>, and the virus that causes it as SARS-COV-2. During the first phase of the pandemic, the Philippines had to close its doors from the outside world. Towns, cities, and provinces also closed their borders. People stockpiled because they do not know how long the lockdown will last.
</p><p>
There were multiple surges in 2020, and it carried over to 2021. Tens of thousands have died, and then, a miracle came in the form of vaccines. At first, there were only a few thousand people who are being vaccinated, but as the government became aggressive on their vaccination program, tens of millions of Filipinos have been inoculated. Today, the cases are dropping, and the Philippines is slowly reopening, thanks to the effort of the government, the medical professionals, and everyone who made it possible.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning Objectives
</p><p>Understand the expectations for reading and writing assignments in post-secondary (university, college, institute) courses
</p><p>Understand and apply general strategies to complete post-secondary-level reading assignments efficiently and effectively
</p><p>Recognize specific types of writing assignments frequently included in post-secondary courses
</p><p>Understand and apply general strategies for managing post-secondary-level writing assignments
</p><p>Determine specific reading and writing strategies that work best for you individually
</p><p>In a post-secondary environment, academic expectations change from what you may have experienced in high school. The quantity of work you are expected to do is increased. When instructors expect you to read pages upon pages or study hours and hours for one particular course, managing your workload can be challenging. This chapter includes strategies for studying efficiently and managing your time.
</p><p>
</p><p>The quality of the work you do also changes. It is not enough to understand course material and summarize it on an exam. You will also be expected to seriously engage with new ideas by reflecting on them, analyzing them, critiquing them, making connections, drawing conclusions, or finding new ways of thinking about a given subject. Educationally, you are moving into deeper waters. A good introductory writing course will help you swim.

                        • Education in the New Normal<p></p><p>Corona Virus crisis continue to devastate countries like the Philippines. The sector of education is one of the most affected which leave us with no choice but the distance learning, either online or modular.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This forced platform requires not just the teachers but the students as well to work harder than before and change their mindsets. The lack of learning devices, unstable data connection and other new changes let all the people suffer from doing their school works. Students who are unprivileged are the most affected. They are at the disadvantage having less resources. No matter how hard they work, it wouldn’t be enough. Same with the students who have the resources but isn’t fast learning. Both parties are in difficulties but the education needs to be pursued. It’s a lot times better than continuing the face-to-face learning which gives us the higher risks of being infected by the virus. Health should always comes first yet the problems people are now facing should also be addressed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Despite the hardships, we have this goal to achieve. That’s why, we are all continue to strive for the better future that awaits us. Let’s continue to learn! This virus might be a hindrance but this can’t stop us with our desire to achieve our dreams. </p><p></p><p>-</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>EDUCATION IN THE NEW NORMAL</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>With the start of the new academic year in July just around the corner, educators and policymakers just have to be prepared for the new normal for the 44 plus million students across the country.<p></p>In light of the joint ministerial decree by the education minister, religious affairs minister, home minister and health minister announced on 2020 regarding the school reopening during the pandemic, schooling practices need to be reimagined and reshaped to prevent a possible second outbreak.<p></p>Lessons learned during the current school disruption should drive educators to change their perspectives and practices. Reshaping schooling perspectives and practices should deliberate on the why, who, what and how of education. It is true that the current pandemic and concern over a potential second outbreak have disrupted traditional schooling practices, but the way of creating the new normal should go beyond the current pandemic and delve deeper than fear of illness. Re-imagining a new forms of education may open doors for more equitable quality education for all young Filipinos.<p></p><strong>Despite all the COVID-19 maladies, the pandemic disruption has brought awareness to new possibilities in reviving our education system and in ushering young Filipinos into the future on a more level playing field.</strong><p></p><p></p><p><strong>I HOPE IT'S HELP(^◕.◕^)</strong></p><p></p><br />
