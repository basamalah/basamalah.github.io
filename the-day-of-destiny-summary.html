                        At the point when Launcelot knows about the passing of Arthur and Gawain, he comes to England in scramble. He searches for the ruler and discovers her in an abbey. For affection for Guinevere as much with respect to regret he goes up against the propensity for a minister. Guided by dreams, he goes to Almesbury, where he discovers Guinevere dead. He covers her adjacent to King Arthur, at that point sickens and kicks the bucket himself. He is covered at Joyous Gard. Constantine rules after Arthur, however the insufficient leftovers of the Round Table are scattered. Bors, Ector, Blamour, and Bleoberis go to the Holy Land to battle the heathen. The rest just stray.<br />

                        <p>Mordred makes himself King of England and incestuously claims Guinevere as his wife. Guinevere escapes to the Tower of London. The Bishop of Canterbury reproaches Mordred for his usurpation and would-be incest, and when Mordred tries to kill him, he flees and becomes a hermit. Mordred wins many Englishmen to his side, then meets Arthur at Dover but is forced to retreat from him.</p><p>In this battle Gawain is mortally wounded. As he dies he admits to Arthur that if it were not for his insane pride in insisting on unjust revenge, Launcelot would be here now to save the kingdom; then he writes Launcelot, begging him to come help Arthur and also to pray at his tomb. Then, bleeding from the wound he got originally from Launcelot — with the fated sword of Balyn — Gawain dies.</p><p>Arthur meets Mordred again at the battle of Bareon Down and again puts him to flight. They meet next at Salisbury Plain, and there, with all who loved Launcelot fighting on Mordred's side, they prepare for what is to be their last battle. The night before the battle, Arthur dreams he is on the Wheel of Fortune, sitting on a throne and dressed in the richest gold that can be made:</p><p>And the kynge thought there was undir hym, farre from hym, an hydeous depe blak watir, and therein was all maner of serpentis and wormes and wylde bestis fowle and orryble. And suddeynly the kyrige thought that the whyle turned upso-downe, and he felle anionge the serpentis, and every beste toke hym by it lynnue. And than the kynge cryed as he lay in hys bed, "Helpe! Helpe!"</p><p>After the prophetic dream he has another. Gawain and a number of ladies come to him to warn him against fighting in the morning for if Arthur fights, he will die; if he waits for a month, Launcelot will be here to help him. Then Gawain and the ladies vanish.</p><p>Arthur asks a truce, and the two armies meet on the field to set terms. An adder appears, a knight unthinkingly draws his sword to kill it, and the two armies are at war. At the end of the day, Mordred is the only man of his army left standing, and Arthur has only two knights, Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere. Against Sir Lucan's advice, Arthur fights Mordred and kills him, but he gets his own death wound as he does it. Lucan and Bedivere bear him to a chapel. Robbers overrun the battlefield stealing the gear of dead knights, killing any that have life left in them.</p><p>Arthur is dying and cannot be moved to safety. And so he sends Bedivere to throw Excalibur into the lake nearby, then return and tell what he has seen. Bedivere hides the sword under a tree, thinking it too precious to throw away, then returns and says he has obeyed. "What did you see?" Arthur asks. Bedivere says he saw only waves and winds. Arthur sends him twice more, and the last time Bedivere does as he has been commanded. A hand catches the sword and brandishes it three times.</p><p>Then at Arthur's command, Bedivere carries the king to the waterside, where a barge awaits him and some ladies in black hoods. Bedivere puts Arthur in the barge and he is borne away to Avilon, perhaps to heal his wounds, perhaps to die. Bedivere wanders through a forest until he comes to where a hermit is kneeling over a fresh grave. It is the grave of a man brought to him at midnight by ladies in black. Whether or not the body is really that of Arthur, no one knows. Some say Arthur still lives, and some say riot.</p><p>~Odette &lt;3</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Mordred makes himself King of England and takes Guinevere as his wife. He then forces a battle with Sir Gawain, who is mortally wounded in the battle. Arthur meets Mordred again at the battle of Bareon Down, and the two men prepare for what will be their last battle.</p><p></p><p>Arthur has a dream telling him that if he fights Mordred that day, he will die, but if he can stall the battle another month, Lancelot will be able to come and help him. When Arthur tries to draw a truce with Mordred and his army, a snake comes by and one of Mordred's men draws his sword to kill it. This action sets the two armies to war.</p><p></p><p>By the end of the battle, Mordred is the only man standing from his army, and Arthur has himself, Sir Lucan, and Sir Bedivere. Against Lucan's advice, Arthur fights Mordred and kills him, but Arthur sustains his own death wound in the process.</p><p></p><p>Arthur is dying and can't be moved safely, so he asks Sir Bedivere to throw Excalibur into the lake. At first, Bedivere merely hides the sword, because he believes it to be too precious to throw away, but he eventually obeys Arthur's orders and throws the sword into the water. Arthur asks Bedivere what he saw when he did so, and Bedivere reports that a hand caught the sword and brandished it three times.</p><p></p><p>Arthur then commands Bedivere to take him to the water, where a barge is waiting. Arthur is borne on the barge to Avalon. Bedivere then takes to wandering the woods and eventually stumbles upon a hermit mourning at a grave. It is unclear to both Bedivere and the reader whether or not the grave is that of King Arthur, and whether or not Arthur still lives.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        THE DAY W/ DESTINY<br /><br /><br />Mordred makes himself King of England and incestuously claims Guinevere as his wife. Guinevere escapes to the Tower of London. The Bishop of Canterbury reproaches Mordred for his usurpation and would-be incest, and when Mordred tries to kill him, he flees and becomes a hermit. Mordred wins many Englishmen to his side, then meets Arthur at Dover but is forced to retreat from him.<br /><br />In this battle Gawain is mortally wounded. As he dies he admits to Arthur that if it were not for his insane pride in insisting on unjust revenge, Launcelot would be here now to save the kingdom; then he writes Launcelot, begging him to come help Arthur and also to pray at his tomb. Then, bleeding from the wound he got originally from Launcelot — with the fated sword of Balyn — Gawain dies.<br /><br />Arthur meets Mordred again at the battle of Bareon Down and again puts him to flight. They meet next at Salisbury Plain, and there, with all who loved Launcelot fighting on Mordred's side, they prepare for what is to be their last battle. The night before the battle, Arthur dreams he is on the Wheel of Fortune, sitting on a throne and dressed in the richest gold that can be made:<br /><br />And the kynge thought there was undir hym, farre from hym, an hydeous depe blak watir, and therein was all maner of serpentis and wormes and wylde bestis fowle and orryble. And suddeynly the kyrige thought that the whyle turned upso-downe, and he felle anionge the serpentis, and every beste toke hym by it lynnue. And than the kynge cryed as he lay in hys bed, "Helpe! Helpe!"<br /><br />After the prophetic dream he has another. Gawain and a number of ladies come to him to warn him against fighting in the morning for if Arthur fights, he will die; if he waits for a month, Launcelot will be here to help him. Then Gawain and the ladies vanish.<br /><br />Arthur asks a truce, and the two armies meet on the field to set terms. An adder appears, a knight unthinkingly draws his sword to kill it, and the two armies are at war. At the end of the day, Mordred is the only man of his army left standing, and Arthur has only two knights, Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere. Against Sir Lucan's advice, Arthur fights Mordred and kills him, but he gets his own death wound as he does it. Lucan and Bedivere bear him to a chapel. Robbers overrun the battlefield stealing the gear of dead knights, killing any that have life left in them.<br /><br />Arthur is dying and cannot be moved to safety. And so he sends Bedivere to throw Excalibur into the lake nearby, then return and tell what he has seen. Bedivere hides the sword under a tree, thinking it too precious to throw away, then returns and says he has obeyed. "What did you see?" Arthur asks. Bedivere says he saw only waves and winds. Arthur sends him twice more, and the last time Bedivere does as he has been commanded. A hand catches the sword and brandishes it three times.<br /><br />Then at Arthur's command, Bedivere carries the king to the waterside, where a barge awaits him and some ladies in black hoods. Bedivere puts Arthur in the barge and he is borne away to Avilon, perhaps to heal his wounds, perhaps to die. Bedivere wanders through a forest until he comes to where a hermit is kneeling over a fresh grave. It is the grave of a man brought to him at midnight by ladies in black. Whether or not the body is really that of Arthur, no one knows. Some say Arthur still lives, and some say riot.<br />
