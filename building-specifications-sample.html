A sample of 2,000 was sought to estimate the average achievement in science offifth graders in a city's public schools. The average 5th grade enrollment in the city's elementary schools is 100students. Thus, 20 schools were randomly selected and within each of those schools all fifth graders were tested._________2. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups inmates by thetype of crime committed, determines the percentage of the total in each crime category, and uses that percentageto determine the number of inmates randomly selected from each group._________3. A researcher has a population of 100 third grade children from a local school districtfrom which a sample of 25 children is to be selected. Each child's name is put on a list, and each child isassigned a number from 1 to 100. Then the numbers 1 to 100 are written on separate pieces of paper andshuffled. Finally, the researcher picks 25 slips of paper and the numbers on the paper determine the 25participants.___________4. A sociologist conducts an opinion survey in a major city. Part of the research plancalls for describing and comparing the opinions of four different ethnic groups: African Americans, AsianAmericans, European Americans, and Native Americans. For a total sample of 300, the researcher selects 75participants from each of the four predetermined subgroups.________5. A researcher is interested in political attitudes of individuals within a particularstate. The researcher uses the following procedure to obtain a sample: (a) a random sample of counties is drawn,(b) within the counties selected, districts are randomly drawn, () within each district, blocks are randomlysampled, (d) within blocks selected, building are randomly drawn, and (d) all residents within the buildingsselected comprise the sample._________6. Instructors teaching research methods are interested in knowing what studytechniques their students are utilizing. Rather than assessing all students, the researchers randomly select 10students from each of the sections to comprise their sample.__________7. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups maximum-security prisons by state, randomly selects 10 states, and, from those 10, selects three prisons. She includes allthe inmates in those three prisons in her sample.__________8. Say you wanted to survey professors at KSU about their publication records. Youwant to be sure to include professors from each department, even the very small ones.____________9. Say you want to study the participants who attended a certain activity or event, whatsampling technique will you use?___________10. Say you were interested in sampling students who deal drugs on campus. Whatsampling technique could you use to build this sample?​</a>

                                            A team at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London is paving the way for future rovers to search for meteorites on Mars. The scientists are using the NHM's extensive meteorite collection to test the spectral instruments destined for the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin, and develop tools to identify meteorites on the surface of the red planet. The project is being presented today (23 July) at the virtual National Astronomy Meeting 2021.The cratered surface of our nearest planetary neighbor has a long and complex history, and searching for rocks amidst more rocks may seem like a futile activity. Despite this, Martian rovers statistically have a significantly higher 'find per mile' success rate than dedicated meteorite hunts on Earth: for every kilometer travelled by a Mars rover, approximately one meteorite is found, even though the rovers have not been specifically looking for them up till now.However, as part of the European Space Agency's upcoming ExoMars mission, the next rover -- named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist best known for her pioneering work on DNA -- will drill down into the Martian surface to sample the soil, analyze its composition and search for evidence of past or present life buried underground.Meteorites are important pieces of evidence that can help us understand this story; once a meteorite lands on a planet, it is subjected to the same atmospheric conditions as the rest of the surface. Chemical and physical weathering can provide information on climate weathering rates and water-rock interactions, meteorite sizes and distribution can help to infer information about the density of the atmosphere, and stony meteorites could be a potential delivery mechanism for organic materials to Mars."Meteorites act as a witness plate across geological time," said Sara Motaghian, the PhD student at the NHM and Imperial College London who is carrying out the work. "Generally, the surfaces of Mars we are exploring are incredibly ancient, meaning there have been billions of years for the surface to accumulate these meteorites and lock in information from across Mars' past."The team are looking in particular at the use of multispectral imaging with the PanCam instrument, hoping to be able to highlight features in images that could be associated with meteorites as the rover moves across the surface. They are also investigating the possibility of using pattern recognition techniques to distinguish features such as Widmanstätten patterns, which can be revealed by extreme weathering.The launch of the ExoMars rover was originally scheduled for 2020, however was delayed until 2022 due to technical issues and growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Once the rover reaches Mars in 2023, the team hope that their work will allow meteorites on the surface to be studied for longer by the Rosalind Franklin rover before it drives on, helping to build a more complete understanding of the Martian surface and its history, if any, of life.​</a>

Do this in your notebook. Personal Experiences Possible Literary Elements to be used UKA MD Knowing your prior knowledge about literary elements and the possible sources of contents using your personal experiences will help you create your own samples of literary elements based on your experiences. You have known already that literary elements are the things that all literatures-whether it is a news article, a book, or a poem-absolutely have to have. Just like a house, the elements might be arranged slightly different. But at the end of the day, they are usually all present and accounted for. Literary elements are the fundamental building blocks of writing. They play an important role in helping us write, read and understand literature. Hartgers (2020) defined literary elements as writing techniques used to create artistic special effects, that immerse the reader into a narrative, story, or text. Literary elements are specific ways that storytellers use words in specific patterns to tell their stories. They are considered as main tools in a writer's toolbox. Popular literary devices include allusion, diction, foreshadowing, imagery, metaphors, similes and personification.​</a>

A sample of 2,000 was sought to estimate the average achievement in science offifth graders in a city's public schools. The average 5th grade enrollment in the city's elementary schools is 100students. Thus, 20 schools were randomly selected and within each of those schools all fifth graders were tested._________2. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups inmates by thetype of crime committed, determines the percentage of the total in each crime category, and uses that percentageto determine the number of inmates randomly selected from each group._________3. A researcher has a population of 100 third grade children from a local school districtfrom which a sample of 25 children is to be selected. Each child's name is put on a list, and each child isassigned a number from 1 to 100. Then the numbers 1 to 100 are written on separate pieces of paper andshuffled. Finally, the researcher picks 25 slips of paper and the numbers on the paper determine the 25participants.___________4. A sociologist conducts an opinion survey in a major city. Part of the research plancalls for describing and comparing the opinions of four different ethnic groups: African Americans, AsianAmericans, European Americans, and Native Americans. For a total sample of 300, the researcher selects 75participants from each of the four predetermined subgroups.________5. A researcher is interested in political attitudes of individuals within a particularstate. The researcher uses the following procedure to obtain a sample: (a) a random sample of counties is drawn,(b) within the counties selected, districts are randomly drawn, () within each district, blocks are randomlysampled, (d) within blocks selected, building are randomly drawn, and (d) all residents within the buildingsselected comprise the sample._________6. Instructors teaching research methods are interested in knowing what studytechniques their students are utilizing. Rather than assessing all students, the researchers randomly select 10students from each of the sections to comprise their sample.__________7. A researcher is interested in maximum-security inmates. She groups maximum-security prisons by state, randomly selects 10 states, and, from those 10, selects three prisons. She includes allthe inmates in those three prisons in her sample.__________8. Say you wanted to survey professors at KSU about their publication records. Youwant to be sure to include professors from each department, even the very small ones.____________9. Say you want to study the participants who attended a certain activity or event, whatsampling technique will you use?___________10.

                            6. A team at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London is paving the way for future rovers to search for meteorites on Mars. The scientists are using the NHM's extensive meteorite collection to test the spectral instruments destined for the ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin, and develop tools to identify meteorites on the surface of the red planet. The project is being presented today (23 July) at the virtual National Astronomy Meeting 2021.The cratered surface of our nearest planetary neighbor has a long and complex history, and searching for rocks amidst more rocks may seem like a futile activity. Despite this, Martian rovers statistically have a significantly higher 'find per mile' success rate than dedicated meteorite hunts on Earth: for every kilometer travelled by a Mars rover, approximately one meteorite is found, even though the rovers have not been specifically looking for them up till now.However, as part of the European Space Agency's upcoming ExoMars mission, the next rover -- named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist best known for her pioneering work on DNA -- will drill down into the Martian surface to sample the soil, analyze its composition and search for evidence of past or present life buried underground.Meteorites are important pieces of evidence that can help us understand this story; once a meteorite lands on a planet, it is subjected to the same atmospheric conditions as the rest of the surface. Chemical and physical weathering can provide information on climate weathering rates and water-rock interactions, meteorite sizes and distribution can help to infer information about the density of the atmosphere, and stony meteorites could be a potential delivery mechanism for organic materials to Mars."Meteorites act as a witness plate across geological time," said Sara Motaghian, the PhD student at the NHM and Imperial College London who is carrying out the work. "Generally, the surfaces of Mars we are exploring are incredibly ancient, meaning there have been billions of years for the surface to accumulate these meteorites and lock in information from across Mars' past."The team are looking in particular at the use of multispectral imaging with the PanCam instrument, hoping to be able to highlight features in images that could be associated with meteorites as the rover moves across the surface. They are also investigating the possibility of using pattern recognition techniques to distinguish features such as Widmanstätten patterns, which can be revealed by extreme weathering.The launch of the ExoMars rover was originally scheduled for 2020, however was delayed until 2022 due to technical issues and growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Once the rover reaches Mars in 2023, the team hope that their work will allow meteorites on the surface to be studied for longer by the Rosalind Franklin rover before it drives on, helping to build a more complete understanding of the Martian surface and its history, if any, of life.​</h2><br />

Do this in your notebook. Personal Experiences Possible Literary Elements to be used UKA MD Knowing your prior knowledge about literary elements and the possible sources of contents using your personal experiences will help you create your own samples of literary elements based on your experiences. You have known already that literary elements are the things that all literatures-whether it is a news article, a book, or a poem-absolutely have to have. Just like a house, the elements might be arranged slightly different. But at the end of the day, they are usually all present and accounted for. Literary elements are the fundamental building blocks of writing. They play an important role in helping us write, read and understand literature. Hartgers (2020) defined literary elements as writing techniques used to create artistic special effects, that immerse the reader into a narrative, story, or text. Literary elements are specific ways that storytellers use words in specific patterns to tell their stories. They are considered as main tools in a writer's toolbox. Popular literary devices include allusion, diction, foreshadowing, imagery, metaphors, similes and personification.​</h2><br />
