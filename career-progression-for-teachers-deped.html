                    <p>Make a question based on the articleThe Department of Education (DepEd) continues to seek more career opportunities for teachers – especially in creating new teaching positions – in line with its commitment to provide them career and financial stability. DepEd, on Tuesday, May 11, said that it is “continuously working” with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Civil Service Commission (CSC) in revising the Career Progression System for Public School Teachers. We are continuously finding ways to give our teachers the necessary benefits and assistance they should be receiving with or without the pandemic,” Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said. “We are committed to helping them, especially in these trying times,” she added. If approved, DepEd said that the teaching career line will have items for Teacher IV, V, VI, VII, and Master Teacher V. DepEd explained that the career progression reform initiative seeks to “ensure more opportunities for career movement, professional growth, and, eventually, financial stability for high-performing and deserving teachers.”I need 9 question and use this format!Example: Questiona.b.c.d.​</p>

Make a question based on the articleThe Department of Education (DepEd) continues to seek more career opportunities for teachers – especially in creating new teaching positions – in line with its commitment to provide them career and financial stability. DepEd, on Tuesday, May 11, said that it is “continuously working” with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Civil Service Commission (CSC) in revising the Career Progression System for Public School Teachers. We are continuously finding ways to give our teachers the necessary benefits and assistance they should be receiving with or without the pandemic,” Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said. “We are committed to helping them, especially in these trying times,” she added. If approved, DepEd said that the teaching career line will have items for Teacher IV, V, VI, VII, and Master Teacher V. DepEd explained that the career progression reform initiative seeks to “ensure more opportunities for career movement, professional growth, and, eventually, financial stability for high-performing and deserving teachers.”I need 9 question and use this format!Example: Questiona.b.c.d.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>MANILA, Philippines — Former senator and presidential candidate Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on Tuesday urged the government to ensure the safety of students and teachers after nearly 100 schools in the country were allowed to conduct in-person classes.
</p><p>
</p><p>In a statement, Marcos asked the Department of Education (DepEd) to deploy only vaccinated teachers to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The DepEd, he said, must continue to encourage teachers and students to get vaccinated.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>“We should ensure the safety of children and teachers. We should strengthen the coordination and cooperation between local governments, the Department of Health and the Department of Education for the orderly implementation of the program,” he said.

</p><p>Citing the experiences of other countries, Marcos pointed out that there were risks involved in having nonvaccinated teachers and staff report for work during in-person classes.
</p><p>
</p><p>The DepEd has identified 90 out of the 100 public schools that would be allowed to hold the pilot run of the in-person classes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Despite this development, Marcos reminded parents that the program was voluntary and parents would need to provide a signed consent if they want to allow their children to join the pilot run of the in-person classes.
</p><p>
</p><p>The pilot run of the in-person classes will begin on Nov. 15 for public schools and Nov. 22 for private schools.

                        It depends. Dou you have a partner? Well,if you have a partner you two must be legally married. There is no law against hiring the pregnant woman as a teacher in Dep-Ed accredited schools, whether she is married or not.<br /><br />If she got pregnant with a married man, but she's not cohabitating with the man, she can still teach unless a case is filed against her for violating the Code of Ethics for Professional Teachers.<br /><br />In some religious private schools, the policy is more strict.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>How may we express our heartfelt gratitude to our teachers? Friend, philosopher and guide all rolled into one. Yes, every teacher of ours has been just that.
</p><p>Our teachers have facilitated our scholastic abilities and aptitudes. They have helped us cross the thresholds to possess the academic prerequisites to clear exams and qualify at different levels in our academic pursuits. They have been patient with us even as they got us grounded in the fundamentals of every subject. They have taught us with love. And that has often lightened even subjects that we found very tough.
</p><p>But then our teachers have done much, much more than that. And we have learned from our teachers in so many different ways. Our teachers have guided us when we have faced difficult situations and dilemmas. When we have been low, and down and dejected they have been successful in raising our spirits and putting us right back on track. They have loved us even when we played truant and were mischievous and played pranks. They have offered us support in so many ways that made the process of education enjoyable. They have striven hard to inculcate in us human values and right ethics so that we may have a future guided by goodness and righteousness. They have helped us seek the truth and live by it at all times. They have given their time most generously, and offered advice most willingly. Isn’t it?
</p><p>And naturally our teachers have been our role models. We have always looked up to our teachers with respect, awe and love. And we have always wondered if we could ever match up to them. Right?
</p><p>Really speaking, it may never be possible for us to say all that our teachers have done for us and made possible for us so that we may work hard, excel and have a bright and happy future.
</p><p>As we come together to thank our teachers, we find words are insufficient to do that. Words seem to pale before our teachers’ selfless service and devotion to the cause of educating, enlightening and moulding our minds, hearts and lives in totality. Words can never equal what our teachers have done for us with no expectation whatsoever.
</p><p>Nevertheless, we have to resort to saying verbally a thank you to our teachers which is, of course, backed by our most sincere gratitude and deep love and appreciation.
</p><p>Dear teachers, we want to say a heartfelt thank you to you all. You mean so much to us. What you have given us will help us go into the world for building our future.
</p><p>All the beautiful flowers that could go into making a fragrant and extravagant bouquet would whither after a time, but dear teachers, our love and respect and regard for you for all that you have done to bolster and buttress our strength, and courage shall remain fresh always, in fact, will only grow and grow.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>to respected principals,teachers and to my fellow students,good day ! Teachers hold a very special place in the lives of students. They play a very important role in shaping a nation’s future by guiding their students in becoming ideal citizens. it’s an opportunity for me to share few words about teachers, their role in schools and colleges and their influence on the students.</p><p>Teachers are the backbone of our society because they majorly contribute in shaping the future of a nation, i.e. students and guide them in becoming an ideal citizen of the country. Teacher’s job is full of responsibility and challenges because not every student is same and thus the teacher has to be dynamic and adopt different teaching patterns for different students. Teaching is a social practice and more than knowledge, a teacher must be a good human being who can very well shoulder the responsibility of his/her job and understand the sensitivity of the situation where students from different backgrounds have come together for learning and thus apply skills and knowledge to the best of his/her capacity while teaching.
</p><p>Some of the qualities which every teacher must possess in order to become most acceptable are:
</p><p>Enthusiasm – It is a known fact that teachers who show enthusiasm while teaching create a positive atmosphere and learning environment which help students in gaining knowledge fast and with fun. These teachers don’t follow the uniform pattern instead, they innovate teaching methods to keep the students engaged and enthusiastic.
</p><p>The most important role a teacher plays is in motivating the students; some of the students find their teacher to be a role model and try to imitate them. Thus it is very important that the teacher leaves a positive impression on each student.
</p><p>Interaction with learners – It is very important for the teacher to indulge into transparent and open discussion with the students in order to understand the capability of the learner. Some students are shy, while other may be afraid of failure. A teacher is highly trusted to build up the student emotionally and practically.
</p><p>Conventionally, teaching is considered equivalent to praying. In olden days, parents used to leave their children in gurukul (a kind of residential school where students live with the teacher for studies). This tradition was greatly supported by the trust and bond between the parents and teachers. Even today, trust is one of the most important factors which motivate parents to get their children admitted in a particular school. A teacher is considered to be the alternate parents; this makes teaching all the more challenging and full of accountability.
</p><p>In recent days, we get to hear a lot about corporal punishment. Some of the teachers get barbaric and beat students so badly that some of them don’t even survive. This is highly restricted in all over India. Though it is important for the teachers to be strict sometimes but there can be alternate methods to punish the students than harming them physically.
</p><p>Well, I would like to end this note with a huge thanks to our teachers who are so caring and compassionate. We are highly honoured to be a part of this School.
</p><p>Thank You!</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            30. Why is English often learned for career progression in some non-English speakingcountries? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The English language has a great reach and influence, and English is taught all over the world. In countries where English is not usually a native language, there are two distinct models for teaching English: Educational programs for students who want to move to English-speaking countries, and other programs for students who do not intend to move but who want to understand English content for the purposes of education, entertainment, employment or conducting international business. The differences between these two models of English language education have grown larger over time, and teachers focusing on each model have used different terminology, received different training, and formed separate professional associations. English is also taught as a second language for recent immigrants to English-speaking countries, which faces separate challenges because the students in one class may speak many different native languages.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Sana tama </p><p></p><br />
