Identify the different typesof welding materials by writing down the correct answer on the space provided.1. It is a metal that can also be welded readily when proper technique isused and adequate knowledge is applied.2. Two considerations needed in using this type of steel is choosing theproper grade for its purpose and knowing the strength of the materials.3. One reason for its excellent weldability is its more ductile than othertypes of steel because it has low amounts of carbon.4. This material is similar to aluminum, its element has much lowermelting point than oxides, making it critical to remove oxides before welding.5. To protect this material from oxidation, it requires full coverage from ashielding gas to provide a high level of weld integrity.11ing steel product Write your answer on the​</a>

                                            Let's Explore This Suggested Time Allotment: 20 Minutes Activity 1: Directions: The following situations depict some work values. Choose two (2) situations and read them carefully. Write your insights on a clean sheet of paper. And answer the processing questions thereafter. Situation 1 The teacher asked her learners to bring materials for the slogan making contest. This will be their output for the end of 2nd quarter. Owen brought his own materials, the same with Brett and Rozlin. But Aiza forgot to bring hers. She decided to borrow materials from Nicole. Willingly, Nicole and Brett lent their materials to her. Not only they wrote the slogan but also added colorful designs and artworks to make it more appealing to the eyes. The teacher marked their works with "Very Good". Situation 2 There will be a Science Quiz Bee for the Grade 10. The adviser asked her five (5) learners to join. Donna and Laurice invited their co-participants in their class to conduct group review so that they will be prepared for the event. Everyone participated and did their best during the contest. Donna won first place followed by Laurice. Situation 3 Due to the lack of classrooms, learners are congested in their class. To resolve the problem, the principal divided the class into 2. Half the class will have their session in the morning as early as 6 o'clock and the other half in the afternoon. Yannah lived far from the school. She finds it difficult to meet the call time aside from the fact that she is also selling vegetables in the market after school. So, she wakes up early every morning so as not to miss classes and adjust her schedule to attend her work. At night, she still manages to do her homework so that she can be ready in class the next day. Situation 4 Learners were instructed to choose their field of specialization in their Technology Livelihood Education (TLE) class. Rona, Joselie, and Mavic enrolled in an electrical installation course while Efren, Enrique, and Floro decided to register in dressmaking class. Their teacher accepted these learners and treated them equally.​</a>

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.

Donna and Laurice invited their co-participants in their class to conduct group review so that they will be prepared for the event. Everyone participated and did their best during the contest. Donna won first place followed by Laurice. Situation 3 Due to the lack of classrooms, learners are congested in their class. To resolve the problem, the principal divided the class into 2. Half the class will have their session in the morning as early as 6 o'clock and the other half in the afternoon. Yannah lived far from the school. She finds it difficult to meet the call time aside from the fact that she is also selling vegetables in the market after school. So, she wakes up early every morning so as not to miss classes and adjust her schedule to attend her work. At night, she still manages to do her homework so that she can be ready in class the next day.

                            9. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</h2><br />
