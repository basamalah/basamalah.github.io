Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don't work... Use more gun. Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil' old number designed by me, built by me, and you best hope... Not pointed at you.</a>

                                            BALAI Chairman Timmy Mondiguing against city's tree - cutting moratorium plan redevelopment. A local civic leader is vehemently against the city government's plans to impose a moratorium on tree- cutting activities in the Summer Capital especially when pine trees are displaced by building constructions. Timmy Apilis Mondiguing, cited a news report where DENR Cordillera director Ralph Pablo recently suggested to the city council dinance could and these activities for Mayor Benjamin Magalong had proposed to Malacanang so he could dertake "I strongly disagree with this plan. What our officials need to do instead is to immediately declare a moratorium on issuances of titles for lands covered by tax declarations" Mondiguing stressed He explained that when innocent owners buy land in a commercial area or in a subdivision they did not buy these lands with their hard- earned money only to be turned into a water reserve, forest or for regreening purposes by the local government. These owners buy land either for residential purposes or to build commercial structures that will provide much need jobs and revenue to bolster the city's coffers," Mondiguing said. Although he fully supports the move of local officials in their aspirations to develop Mondiguing believes that Baguio, this should be done without violating the rights of innocent owners on how they will use their acquired land as long as their actions are within the purview of the law                           use dis in tree sentence​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Those who inhabit the global economy are all too prone to treat matters of human dignity and security as outside their legitimate purview – matters for local political responsibility. . . . . For business leaders, this means understanding the place of their sector, industry or company in the broader social and political world – whether or not they are incentivized or compelled by regulation to do so. The same is true for local and national political actors [and] private citizens and social networks, who can no longer leave questions of global welfare and sustainability to political and economic leadership.</p><p>Readers' Guide Comment on “understanding the place of their sector, industry or company”</p><p></p><p>Of course, in one sense business leaders certainly ‘understand [their] place’ in the global world, otherwise they would not be so successful in the competitive global market. What WEF does not explain is which elements of ‘understanding’ business leaders are missing, and how this knowledge would engender a different set of choices than their current ‘understanding’ of the political, social, and ethical realities of the world.</p><p></p><p>Readers' Guide Comment on “who can no longer leave questions of global welfare … to political and economic leadership"</p><p></p><p>Non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations long ago stopped trying to leave decision-making on global welfare and sustainability to nation-states and corporations, respectively. Again the ‘non-state’ terminology is used as an umbrella term, inappropriately conflating multinational corporations and civil society organizations.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainlest na mahirap isulat iyan lahat☹</p><br />

                        HISTORY OF NSTP<p>The Years of Spain During the time that the Philippines was a Spanish colony, the University of Sto. Tomas had a training program that was like what we now call ROTC. Modern ROTC Begins Most modern writers, on the other hand, think that real ROTC in this country didn't start until 1912 when military training began at the University of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>ROTC in World War II: According to the records, ROTC graduates were called to the colors in 1942 and showed their worth on the battlefield during the occupation. Executive Order No. 59, which was about training after the war, said that all colleges and universities had to offer the ROTC course.</p><p></p>POST MARCOS ERA<p>ROTC is being replaced by the CMT Years or Citizen Military Training.</p><p>The Return of ROTC, or the AFP Reservist Act, is Republic Act 7077.</p><p></p>PRESENT DAY2001's ROTC Crisis ROTC is in danger of dying out because of student protests.Must-Not-Any-More ROTC was no longer required in the Philippines, and the National Service Reserve Corps was set up instead (RA 9163).<p></p>Significance of the NSTP<p>Being a student, you are expected to <strong>experience</strong>, be trained, and feel what is the real world. The theoretical world of going to school should be verified at least as early time as possible. This is what the community immersion had aimed for in the first place. The student would have inspiration from their small experience and observation. By doing so, we will let them feel the responsibility for being a future adult citizen. Maybe one of them will be inspired to do something not just for their own success but for the benefit of the nation. </p><p></p><p><strong>NSTP</strong> stands for National Service Training Program. Some of the programs it offers are ROTC, CWTS, and LTS. Its goal is to promote and integrate values education, transformational leadership, the spirit of patriotism and nationalism, and sustainable social mobilization for youth development, community building, and national security.</p><p></p><p>The National Service Training Program (NSTP) is a program that helps young people become more civically aware and better prepared for defense by teaching them the values of service and patriotism while they train in one of the three (3) parts of the program. These different parts are all made to make it easier for young people to get involved in helping the community.</p><p></p><p>Under Republic Act (RA) No. 9163, all college students must take part in the National Service Training Program (NSTP). The law gives young people a chance to directly help build the country. Under the program, Lasallian students in their first year can take either the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) or the Civic Welfare Service Training Service (CWTS).</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about training here: https://brainly.ph/question/25819624#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
