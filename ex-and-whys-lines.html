27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

                            11. 21. Americans can be divided into three groups—smokers, nonsmokers and that expanding pack of us who have quit. Those who have never smoked don't know what they're missing, but former smokers, ex-smokers, reformed smokers can never forget. We are veterans of a personal war, linked by that watershed experience of ceasing to smoke and by the temptation to have just one more cigarette. *

25. Loving the sea I love seeing the blue sea. I love hearing its wave brushing the shore. I like touching the roughness of the sand under my feet. It makes me want to get soak in the salty water even more. I love how it washes away the uncertainties I kept in me. Oh how I love the sea.

26. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances. *

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

28. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) *

29. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture.
