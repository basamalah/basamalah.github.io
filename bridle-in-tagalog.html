                                            Black Beauty (An excerpt) by Anna Sewell The first place that I can remember was a large pleasant meadow. At the top of the meado Was a grove of fir trees. At the bottom was a running brook overhung by a steep bank At first, when I was very young, I always ran by my mother's side. But soon, when I was old enough to eat grass, my mother would go to work in the daytime. I would run with six other colts who lived in the meadow. We had great fun. We used to gallop together round and round the field as fast as we could go. As I grew older and my coat became shinier , many people came to admire me. I had . fine, black coat, one white foot, and a white star on my forehead. I was four years old when the farmer said that it was time to train me to be obedient. The to learn to wear a saddle and a bridle. And I had to carry a person on my back. At first, I hate a it. Soon I became accustomed to it. I was trained to pull a carriage. One day in May, I was sold to Squire Gordon. My mother gave me this advice: "Do your best wherever you are. Keep up your good name. So I came to Birtwick Pass. I was placed in a large loose box. Two other horses were in stalls next to me. Their names were Merrylegs and Ginger. Soon, I became friendly with both of them a “What shall we call him?" Squire Gordon asked his wife. "He's black as pure ebony and quite a beauty. Let's call him Black Beauty," she suggested One day, John, the coach driver, harnessed me to the cart. We would take the squire to town. It had been raining heavily and the wind was blowing hard. The water had flooded the road up to my knees in some places. But we got through to the town. On our way home, we had to cross a low wooden bridge. When I touched the first part of the bridge, I felt sure there was something wrong. I stopped. "Go on, Black Beauty," my master urged. But I dared not go forward. Just then, the keeper of the bridge came running. He was waving a lantern, and shouting "Hey, stop! The bridge is broken in the middle. Part of it is carried away." The squire patted my head. “Dear Beauty, if you had not been so wise, we might have drowned." "You saved us, Beauty!" said John. a 60​</a>

                            7. Black Beauty (An excerpt) by Anna Sewell The first place that I can remember was a large pleasant meadow. At the top of the meado Was a grove of fir trees. At the bottom was a running brook overhung by a steep bank At first, when I was very young, I always ran by my mother's side. But soon, when I was old enough to eat grass, my mother would go to work in the daytime. I would run with six other colts who lived in the meadow. We had great fun. We used to gallop together round and round the field as fast as we could go. As I grew older and my coat became shinier , many people came to admire me. I had . fine, black coat, one white foot, and a white star on my forehead. I was four years old when the farmer said that it was time to train me to be obedient. The to learn to wear a saddle and a bridle. And I had to carry a person on my back. At first, I hate a it. Soon I became accustomed to it. I was trained to pull a carriage. One day in May, I was sold to Squire Gordon. My mother gave me this advice: "Do your best wherever you are. Keep up your good name. So I came to Birtwick Pass. I was placed in a large loose box. Two other horses were in stalls next to me. Their names were Merrylegs and Ginger. Soon, I became friendly with both of them a “What shall we call him?" Squire Gordon asked his wife. "He's black as pure ebony and quite a beauty. Let's call him Black Beauty," she suggested One day, John, the coach driver, harnessed me to the cart. We would take the squire to town. It had been raining heavily and the wind was blowing hard. The water had flooded the road up to my knees in some places. But we got through to the town. On our way home, we had to cross a low wooden bridge. When I touched the first part of the bridge, I felt sure there was something wrong. I stopped. "Go on, Black Beauty," my master urged. But I dared not go forward. Just then, the keeper of the bridge came running. He was waving a lantern, and shouting "Hey, stop! The bridge is broken in the middle. Part of it is carried away." The squire patted my head. “Dear Beauty, if you had not been so wise, we might have drowned." "You saved us, Beauty!" said John. a 60​</h2><br />
