                                            The paragraphs below consist of shuffled parts of a movie review. Arrange the paragraphs to form a comprehensive movie review of the film, “Kita-Kita”. Organize the paragraphs using the letters of the alphabet. Start with the letter A to arrange the paragraphs in sequential order. ____________1. It’s so simple an idea but it works. “Kita Kita” is really just a two-actor film about a Filipino tour guide in Saporro, Japan, who gets her heart broken and goes blind. Her neighbor, also a Filipino, comes over to her house every day to try and cheer her up and a romance blossoms between them. The movie revolves around this simple plot yet it fills out its 84-minute running time and leaves you completely satisfied at the end. There’s this push and pull about the gimmick of her being blind but it’s used more narratively, and even lyrically, than it is for easy jokes. ____________2. ‘Kita Kita’ is an eye-opener for the romantic comedy genre ____________3. And writer/director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo knows what to do with her camera. In a film about not being able to see, she knows when to give us close-ups and knows when to zoom out. She frames the couple amidst a backdrop of a quaint and rural Japan with the knowledge that one of these characters cannot see it. But in the breaking down of Lea’s walls, the grand architecture or the fields of multi-colored flowers become symbols of Lea’s internal world. It’s a lovely use of cinematography for a film like this. ____________4. It seems, in its trailers, that the comedy is going to stem from Empoy Marquez being not the typical matinee idol and romantic lead type for a woman as gorgeous as Alessandra de Rossi except, since she’s blind, she doesn’t know that. But the film never goes there. It doesn’t go for the easy laughs. Her blindness is caused by the stress of her breakup, and she is shut out from life, and Marquez’s Tonyo asks her to be his tour guide as he will be her eyes. What unfolds is a story about kindness and how it can warm even the coldest of hearts. The film utiliz</a>

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials.

                            2. The paragraphs below consist of shuffled parts of a movie review. Arrange the paragraphs to form a comprehensive movie review of the film, “Kita-Kita”. Organize the paragraphs using the letters of the alphabet. Start with the letter A to arrange the paragraphs in sequential order. ____________1. It’s so simple an idea but it works. “Kita Kita” is really just a two-actor film about a Filipino tour guide in Saporro, Japan, who gets her heart broken and goes blind. Her neighbor, also a Filipino, comes over to her house every day to try and cheer her up and a romance blossoms between them. The movie revolves around this simple plot yet it fills out its 84-minute running time and leaves you completely satisfied at the end. There’s this push and pull about the gimmick of her being blind but it’s used more narratively, and even lyrically, than it is for easy jokes. ____________2. ‘Kita Kita’ is an eye-opener for the romantic comedy genre ____________3. And writer/director Sigrid Andrea Bernardo knows what to do with her camera. In a film about not being able to see, she knows when to give us close-ups and knows when to zoom out. She frames the couple amidst a backdrop of a quaint and rural Japan with the knowledge that one of these characters cannot see it. But in the breaking down of Lea’s walls, the grand architecture or the fields of multi-colored flowers become symbols of Lea’s internal world. It’s a lovely use of cinematography for a film like this. ____________4. It seems, in its trailers, that the comedy is going to stem from Empoy Marquez being not the typical matinee idol and romantic lead type for a woman as gorgeous as Alessandra de Rossi except, since she’s blind, she doesn’t know that. But the film never goes there. It doesn’t go for the easy laughs. Her blindness is caused by the stress of her breakup, and she is shut out from life, and Marquez’s Tonyo asks her to be his tour guide as he will be her eyes. What unfolds is a story about kindness and how it can warm even the coldest of hearts. The film utiliz</h2><br />

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong.
