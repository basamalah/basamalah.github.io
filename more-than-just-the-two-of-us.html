Story Star as a graphic organizer in answering the questions. Directions: Read and understand the short selection. Afterwards, use the A Sad Note (By: Sherry Lou H. Peñol) It was March 2019 when everything started. A sudden change of classmates and teachers. I used to laugh and roam around without everything. I used to go to school every day then. I used to see my worries. On Saturdays, I used to be with my mother going to the market and on Sundays, I used to kneel and pray to God at the church. It is more than two years now, and I can't help myself but long for those things to happen again. I pray that one day, everything will be back to how it was used to be. I pray for a world where people live without fear and worries. I look forward to a day where everyone can see smiles on their faces without those facemasks on. I am Mandy, and this is my sad note. ​</a>

Story Star as a graphic organizer in answering the questions. Directions: Read and understand the short selection. Afterwards, use the A Sad Note (By: Sherry Lou H. Peñol) It was March 2019 when everything started. A sudden change of classmates and teachers. I used to laugh and roam around without everything. I used to go to school every day then. I used to see my worries. On Saturdays, I used to be with my mother going to the market and on Sundays, I used to kneel and pray to God at the church. It is more than two years now, and I can't help myself but long for those things to happen again. I pray that one day, everything will be back to how it was used to be. I pray for a world where people live without fear and worries. I look forward to a day where everyone can see smiles on their faces without those facemasks on. I am Mandy, and this is my sad note. ​</h2><br />
