His father Lucio was the chief musician of the Spanish artillery band in Intramuros and founder of Banda Buenaventura. As a young boy, he had already demonstrated a passion for music while learning the rudiments of music and solfeggio and becoming a proficient clarinet player. Col. Buenaventura further developed his musical abilities at the Conservatory of Music, University of the Philippines (UP) at the age of 19. He received a Teacher’s Diploma in Science and Composition at UP. Nicanor Abelardo and Francisco Santiago were among his famous mentors. He was also awarded a study grant by the UNESCO in 1949. Buenaventura was actively involved with the various military bands which ultimately earned him his military rank of Colonel. Later, he restored the Philippine Constabulary Band in 1945, which was reputedly likened to a symphony orchestra. It was considered as “one of the best military bands in the world.” It would later be renamed the Philippine Army Band. He also founded the San Pablo Music Academy in Laguna. Later, he became the music director of the Conservatory of Music, University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1961. After retiring from the military, he became the music director at the School of Music and Arts, University of the East (UE) in 1964. He was declared National Artist for Music in 1988 and passed away in 1996. THIS IS MY ANSWER HOPE TO HELP, AND MAY SOME OTHERS ADD MORE INTO THIS. TY</a>
