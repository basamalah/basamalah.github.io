Both Superman and Batman are heroes, but only one is truly a superhero, and taking into account their upbringing, motives, and criminal targets, that is Batman. Upbringing was not gentle for either. Superman came from Krypton, a planet that was about to self-destruct. His parents sent him as a baby on a spaceship to Earth. There he would be adopted by an ordinary farm family. His adoptive parents named him Clark Kent and reared him well. In the same generation, far away in Gotham, Bruce Wayne, the future Batman, was born to a contented, wealthy family. Tragically, his parents were killed in his presence during a mugging. He inherited the family wealth and was raised by his kindly butler. Those very different backgrounds provided Superman and Batman with powerful but different motives for fighting crime. Superman was programmed in his space capsule to know about the forces of good and evil on Earth and to fight the bad people. Unlike Superman, Batman learned from experience. Both have gone on to fight many bad people, but each one has a special enemy. For Superman, it is Luthor, who has studied Superman and knows all about him, even his outstanding weakness-the mineral Kryptonite. For Batman, it is the Joker, who, as a wicked teenager, was the mugger-murderer of his parents. Many spectacular battles have ensued for both crime fighters, and one has reached the top in his profession. Superman offers overwhelming physical strength against crime, but Batman displays cunning and base passion. As he strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked, he's not just winning, he is getting even. Most people would cheer Superman on. However, they would identify more with Batman, and he is the superhero - (From Brandon &amp; Brandon, 2011. 282-283) 1. What is the passage all about? 2.

                                            “Three Sons and a Bundle of Sticks” Once upon a time, an old man lived with his three sons in a village. The three sons were hard workers. Still, they quarreled all the time. The old man tried a lot to unite them but he failed. Though the villagers appreciated their hard work and efforts, they made fun of them on their fights. Months passed by and the old man fell sick. He told his sons to stay united, but they didn’t listen to him, So he decided to teach them a practical lesson so that they would forget their differences and stay united.The old man called his sons. He told them, “ I will give you a bundle of sticks. Separate each stick and you will have to break each stick into two. The one who breaks the sticks quickly will be rewarded more”. The sons agreed. The old man gave a bundle of ten sticks to each of them and asked them to break each stick into two pieces. They broke the sticks into pieces in minutes. And again they started to quarrel among themselves who came first. The old man said, “ Dear sons, the game is not over. Now I will give another bundle of sticks to each of you. You will have to break the sticks as a bundle, not as separate sticks.” The sons agreed and tried to break the bundle of sticks. Though they tried their best, they could not break the bundle. They failed to complete the task. The three sons reported their failure to their father. The old man replied, “Dear sons, see! You could easily break the single sticks into pieces, but you were not able to break the bundle! So if you stay united, nobody can do any harm to you. If you quarrel every time with your brothers, anyone can easily defeat you. I request you to stay united.” The three sons understood the power of unity and promised their father that whatever be the situation, they would all stay together.QUESTIONS;1.

                                            Hi can you identify the figure of speech here 
In Christ alone my hope is found,
He is my light, my strength, my song;
this Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
And if I need to suffer, 
for You to be glorified, 
I pray that I’ll be reminded 
of how good you are
That this is just a phase, 
and you understand my pain
so I will seek and shout for You
even louder.
You split the sea, so I could walk right through it.
All my fears were drowned in perfect love.
You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
I am a child of God.
You don’t see the wind but you know it’s there. 
You don’t see air but you know it’s there. 
Faith is like that. 
You don’t need to see God but you know he’s there.
Jesus Christ
You are my one desire
Lord hear my only cry
To know You all my life.
I will give you 25 pts.... please this is my project please</a>

                            9. Read and analyze the following paragraphs. Then answer the questions that follow. Write your answers on your answer sheet. Both Superman and Batman are heroes, but only one is truly a superhero, and taking into account their upbringing, motives, and criminal targets, that is Batman. Upbringing was not gentle for either. Superman came from Krypton, a planet that was about to self-destruct. His parents sent him as a baby on a spaceship to Earth. There he would be adopted by an ordinary farm family. His adoptive parents named him Clark Kent and reared him well. In the same generation, far away in Gotham, Bruce Wayne, the future Batman, was born to a contented, wealthy family. Tragically, his parents were killed in his presence during a mugging. He inherited the family wealth and was raised by his kindly butler. Those very different backgrounds provided Superman and Batman with powerful but different motives for fighting crime. Superman was programmed in his space capsule to know about the forces of good and evil on Earth and to fight the bad people. Unlike Superman, Batman learned from experience. Both have gone on to fight many bad people, but each one has a special enemy. For Superman, it is Luthor, who has studied Superman and knows all about him, even his outstanding weakness-the mineral Kryptonite. For Batman, it is the Joker, who, as a wicked teenager, was the mugger-murderer of his parents. Many spectacular battles have ensued for both crime fighters, and one has reached the top in his profession. Superman offers overwhelming physical strength against crime, but Batman displays cunning and base passion. As he strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked, he's not just winning, he is getting even. Most people would cheer Superman on. However, they would identify more with Batman, and he is the superhero - (From Brandon &amp; Brandon, 2011. 282-283) 1. What is the passage all about? 2.

Still, they quarreled all the time. The old man tried a lot to unite them but he failed. Though the villagers appreciated their hard work and efforts, they made fun of them on their fights. Months passed by and the old man fell sick. He told his sons to stay united, but they didn’t listen to him, So he decided to teach them a practical lesson so that they would forget their differences and stay united.The old man called his sons. He told them, “ I will give you a bundle of sticks. Separate each stick and you will have to break each stick into two. The one who breaks the sticks quickly will be rewarded more”. The sons agreed. The old man gave a bundle of ten sticks to each of them and asked them to break each stick into two pieces. They broke the sticks into pieces in minutes. And again they started to quarrel among themselves who came first. The old man said, “ Dear sons, the game is not over. Now I will give another bundle of sticks to each of you. You will have to break the sticks as a bundle, not as separate sticks.” The sons agreed and tried to break the bundle of sticks. Though they tried their best, they could not break the bundle. They failed to complete the task. The three sons reported their failure to their father. The old man replied, “Dear sons, see! You could easily break the single sticks into pieces, but you were not able to break the bundle! So if you stay united, nobody can do any harm to you. If you quarrel every time with your brothers, anyone can easily defeat you. I request you to stay united.” The three sons understood the power of unity and promised their father that whatever be the situation, they would all stay together.QUESTIONS;1.

this Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
And if I need to suffer, 
for You to be glorified, 
I pray that I’ll be reminded 
of how good you are
That this is just a phase, 
and you understand my pain
so I will seek and shout for You
even louder.
You split the sea, so I could walk right through it.
All my fears were drowned in perfect love.
You rescued me so I could stand and sing.
I am a child of God.
You don’t see the wind but you know it’s there. 
You don’t see air but you know it’s there. 
Faith is like that. 
You don’t need to see God but you know he’s there.

Lord hear my only cry
To know You all my life.
