                            12. A teenager's father is murdered in Somalia, and the boy travels to the United States seeking asylum. Another teen's father and brother are murdered by extremist groups in Afghanistan and he too makes his way to the U.S. to seek asylum. Since both are minors, federal law decrees that they must be held separately from adults under the oversight of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). However, in these two cases, and an unknown number of others, these minors were taken in handcuffs by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and held in adult detention facilities. The reason? In the absence of other Information that could corroborate the teens' self-reported ages, analysis of their dental X-rays revealed that both could be adults. Lawyers for these two teens sued on the grounds that sole reliance on X-rays for age determination is illegal, and several federal judges agreed. Guide Questions: 1. What electromagnetic wave is used in the case above? Support your answer. 2. Is using such electromagnetic wave useful in the case above? Support your answer. 3. If you were one of the immigrants, would you willingly submit to have yourself undergone X-ray to prove yourself being a minor? Why or why not? 4.

                        <p>1.X-ray is an electromagnetic wave that is used in the case described above. This is because X-ray technology uses electromagnetic waves to produce images of the inside of the body, which can be used to visualize bones and other internal structures.</p><p>2.Using X-ray technology in this case could be useful in determining the age of the immigrants in question, as the analysis of dental X-rays can potentially reveal the age of a person based on the development of their teeth. However, relying solely on X-ray analysis to determine age has been called into question, as it is not always accurate and can be affected by a variety of factors.</p><p>3.If I were one of the immigrants seeking asylum, I may not be willing to submit to an X-ray to prove my age, as relying on this method alone may not be considered reliable and could potentially lead to incorrect age determinations. Additionally, the use of X-rays involves exposing the body to ionizing radiation, which may carry some risks and may not be desirable for this purpose.</p><p>4.X-ray is not always a reliable source in determining a person's real age. While X-ray analysis can potentially reveal the age of a person based on the development of their teeth, this method is not always accurate and can be affected by a variety of factors such as past medical treatments, environmental factors, and genetics. Therefore, relying solely on X-ray analysis to determine age may not be considered reliable.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>pls make me branliest</p><br />
