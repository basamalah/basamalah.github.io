                                            Study the text closely. In the middle of this pandemic, people have tried many ways one after another on how to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus as number of infected cases continue to rise. One easy and traditional way that people believe to be effective cure to COVID-19 virus infection is the practice of steam inhalation -locally known as tuob. Rappler.com reported that the employees in Cebu provincial government were instructed to do steam inhalation twice a day at their own workplaces as part of their wellness program. This action serves as their means to battle against the virus. However, this action by the Office of the Governor of Cebu was opposed by WHO Philippines saying that steam inhalation will not prevent one from catching COVID-19. They further elaborated that extremely hot steam can be harmful because of the risk of getting burn injury. Also, they pointed out that science and evidence must be sought in fighting this virus. They clarified that as to date there is no recommended treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 yet. Moreover, they even warned people against self-medicating and using unverified treatments to patients with COVID-19 until there is enough evidence. There is no evidence up to the present time that can attest the efficacy of this inhalation practice in relation to COVID-19.

                                            In August 2007, newspaper reported what seemed to be yet another sad incident of fraternity violence. Cris Anthony Mendez, a twenty-year-old student of the University of the Philippines (UP), was rushed to the hospital in the early morning hours, unconscious, with large bruises on his chest, back, and legs. He passed away that morning, and the subsequent autopsy report strongly suggests that his physical injuries were most probably the result of “Hazing” (the term colloquially used to refer to initiation rites in which neophytes may be subjected to various forms of physical abuse). What exactly happened remains an open question, as none of those who were with him that night came forward to shed light on what had transpired. Needless to say, none of them came forward to assume responsibility for the death of Cris. Even as the leaders of the Sigma Rho fraternity publicly denounced the death of Cris, those members of theirs who had been with him that night vanished, avoiding and refusing to cooperate with legal authorities. Meanwhile, UP students and the general public clamored for justice. In a move that surprised the student body, the UP chancellor called on all fraternities to justify their continued existence. Meanwhile, the case of the tragic death of Cris Anthony Mendez was left unresolved. It remains that way up to this day. No one knows just what exactly happened. No charges have been filed, no definitive testimony has been forthcoming. But there is more to this for us than just a criminal mystery. Pondering on the death of Cris, we may find ourselves asking questions such as, “What is the value of one’s life?” ”What exactly were the wrongs done to Cris by his so-called fraternity brother?” or perhaps even “Is there any good to fraternities?” These questions that concern good and bad, or right and wrong—and these are questions concerning value—are the kind of questions that we deal with in ethics. Reflect and answer the following questions: 1. What is the value of life? 2. If you are a member of this fraternity, what will you do? 3. Based from the given story, what is the concept of morality that this fraternity advocates?​</a>

                            4. In August 2007, newspaper reported what seemed to be yet another sad incident of fraternity violence. Cris Anthony Mendez, a twenty-year-old student of the University of the Philippines (UP), was rushed to the hospital in the early morning hours, unconscious, with large bruises on his chest, back, and legs. He passed away that morning, and the subsequent autopsy report strongly suggests that his physical injuries were most probably the result of “Hazing” (the term colloquially used to refer to initiation rites in which neophytes may be subjected to various forms of physical abuse). What exactly happened remains an open question, as none of those who were with him that night came forward to shed light on what had transpired. Needless to say, none of them came forward to assume responsibility for the death of Cris. Even as the leaders of the Sigma Rho fraternity publicly denounced the death of Cris, those members of theirs who had been with him that night vanished, avoiding and refusing to cooperate with legal authorities. Meanwhile, UP students and the general public clamored for justice. In a move that surprised the student body, the UP chancellor called on all fraternities to justify their continued existence. Meanwhile, the case of the tragic death of Cris Anthony Mendez was left unresolved. It remains that way up to this day. No one knows just what exactly happened. No charges have been filed, no definitive testimony has been forthcoming. But there is more to this for us than just a criminal mystery. Pondering on the death of Cris, we may find ourselves asking questions such as, “What is the value of one’s life?” ”What exactly were the wrongs done to Cris by his so-called fraternity brother?” or perhaps even “Is there any good to fraternities?” These questions that concern good and bad, or right and wrong—and these are questions concerning value—are the kind of questions that we deal with in ethics. Reflect and answer the following questions: 1. What is the value of life? 2. If you are a member of this fraternity, what will you do? 3. Based from the given story, what is the concept of morality that this fraternity advocates?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>A fraternity </strong>is also called a sorority<strong>. </strong>It is<strong> a group of people who aims to have a solid brotherhood </strong>with goals and aims. It usually exists in universities and institutions that sometimes have initiations as their practice in welcoming new members.</p><p></p><p>Here are the answers to your activity:</p><p></p><strong>The value of life is to have freedom and rights to be alive.</strong> We are the ones who choose our path and our goal should be to live every day. We should take care of our lives to have dreams, ambitions, and respect for the ones who love us. It is safe to say that we should care for our lives and live to the fullest. Life is the most valuable thing on Earth because there is only one chance to live. We die once but we can live every day.<br /><br />Fraternities can be used in a good way. If I am a member of the fraternity, <strong>I can use this group as an organization to promote the common good. </strong>Create activities that promote good actions and a healthy mentality for the youth. I can use fraternity as a <strong>way to spread the good news.<br /></strong><br />Rituals such as initiations should not be tolerated. We see no good in doing harmful initiations that could cause the lives of the applicants who want nothing but to join the brotherhood. They advocate solidarity and unity but in other to get this, <strong>you need to pass the initiation as part of their tradition and morality.<br /></strong><p>If you want to know some of the rules of fraternities, please head over to this link:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/21084802</p><p></p><p><strong>#SPJ1</strong></p><br />
