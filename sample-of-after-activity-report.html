Both substances are white crystalline powder. They cannot determine which is a substance and mixture just by looking at it. So, to distinguish which is which, they heated the two samples using an improvised melting dish. Both the two samples were heated at the same time and received an equal amount of heat. After a few minutes, they had observed that Solid A melts completely within a short period of time; while Solid B has portions that seem to be not melting. Guide Questions: 1.

A sample of n=25 is selected from a normal population, = 56 and s= 12.2. Based on the report of the school nurse, the average height of Grade 11 students hasincreased. Five years ago, the average height of Grade 11 students was 170cm with standard deviation of38cm. She took a random sample of 150 students and derived the average height of 165cm.3. Knowing from a previous study that the average of athletes is 80, an athletic adviser askedhow his soccer players are academically doing as compared to other student athletes. After an initiative tohelp improve the average of student athletes, the adviser randomly selected 15 soccer players and found85 as the average with standard deviation of 1.25.4. The CEO of a battery manufacturing company claimed that their batteries would last anaverage of 280 hours under normal use. A researcher randomly selected 20 batteries from the productionline and tested them. The tested batteries had a mean life span of 250 hours with a standard deviation of40 hours. Do we have enough evidence to suggest that the claim of an average of 280 hours is false?5. It was known that the number of tickets purchased by students at the ticket window forthe volleyball match of two popular universities followed a distribution that has mean of 500 and standarddeviation of 8.9. Suppose that a few hours before the start of one of these matches, there are 100 eagerstudents standing in line to purchase tickets.

The study reports on the antibacterial activity of extract taken from the leaf of oak (Querctis persica) against two positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and two negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria. Antibacterial activity of oak determined with disc diffusion test. Collecting the samples was done in Lorestan provenance, after that drying in shadow and extracting by rotary. Finally, the mere extract was poured in Petri dish and put in the refrigerator. Results of the study showed that the extract of oak leaf has antibacterial characteristics against the bacteria presented in the research.2. Overall, the study was conducted successfully. As recommended by the researchers, further studies must be conducted to identify the most important material in the oak leaf that has the most antibacterial characteristics3. The study was clearly presented. The methodology was accurate and the results were reliable and valid4 International Journal of Farming and Allied Sciences (2013) Antibacterial Activity of Leaves Extract from Oak (Quercus persicol Against Some Positive and Negative Bacteria.

                                            h Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 30) — NEW COVID-19 cases in the country hit another grim record on Monday, with 22,366 infections reported by the Department of Health. This is the first time singlo-day cauen topped 20,000, beating the previous record of 19,441 recorded on Saturday, Aug, 28. It also marked the fourth time this month that the daily count reached an all-time high. The total case tally rose to 1,976,202, of which 148,594 or 7.5% are active cases. Of the currently III , 95.7% exhibit mild symptoms, 1.7% are asymptomatic , 0.97% are moderate cases, 1.1% are severe, and 0.6% are critical. Data from two non-reporting testing laboratories were not part of the count, the DOH noted. The two contribute around 0.1% of samples tested and 0.1% of positive individuals, based on department data over the last two weeks. The death toll also struck 33,330 with 222 more fatalities, including 105 earlier classified as recoveries. This is the thirteenth consecutive day the country saw a triple-digit increase in deaths. Meanwhile, 16,864 were added to the survivor count, which has reached 1,794,278. These mean COVID-19 has killed 1.69% of all confirmed patients nationwide, while 90.8% have gotten well. After final validation, the DOH also sald it deleted 187 duplicates, including 174 recoveries and a death. Its report further showed 65,237 COVID-19 tests were reported on Aug. 28, with 27.5% turning out positive. A positivity rate of above 20% is considered "critical level" and indicates inadequate testing efforts, according to the U.S. nonprofit Covid Act Now. This lack of sufficient testing also suggests that new cases and the infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported, the organization explained. he DOH has earlier warned fresh cases may continue to climb in the following days. On Sunday, it also ported that around 69%, or 516, of the 748 samples in the latest batch of whole genome sequencing were und to be of the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant spite the rising numbers, the independent group OCTA Research said Metro Manila may see a downward nd in infections by mid-September, although it said hospitals will likely continue to deal with a high level of upancy rate. ir Summary:​</a>

                                            The Southwest shrub Juniperus communis (Juniper Berry) has many significant medicinal value in the Native American culture that has not been proven scientifically. One of the popular uses of Juniper berries aside from its detoxifying action is its potential to repel insects. This study focuses on the development of insect repellant from its essential oil obtained through steam distillation. 50 g of fresh berries was collected and dried for 5 days and is placed in a still tank with 100 mL of water for steam distillation using the Flinn Scientific Borosilicate Lab Kit. Gather the extracted oil and dilute 70% in three separate containers to be transferred into spray bottles. Testing involved the spraying of the dilute sample into a class jar with Anopheles juidthae (common NM mosquito) and compared this to the effect of a commercial insect repellant. After testing and comparing the result, the commercial insect repellant significantly showed that it is a better insect repellant compared to the J. communis diluted essential oil. However, the essential oil has also an insect repellant potential. Activity: Analysis of the Text Directions: Answer the following questions. 1. What kind of text is this? 2.

Based on the report of the school nurse, the average height of Grade 11 students has increased. Five years ago, the average height of Grade 11 students was 170cm with standard deviation of 38cm. She took a random sample of 150 students and derived the average height of 165cm.___________3. Knowing from a previous study that the average of athletes is 80, an athletic adviser asked how his soccer players are academically doing as compared to other student athletes. After an initiative to help improve the average of student athletes, the adviser randomly selected 15 soccer players and found 85 as the average with standard deviation of 1.25. ___________4.

It was known that the number of tickets purchased by students at the ticket window for the volleyball match of two popular universities followed a distribution that has mean of 500 and standard deviation of 8.9. Suppose that a few hours before the start of one of these matches, there are 100 eager students standing in line to purchase tickets. If there are 250 tickets remaining, what is the probability that all 100 students will be able to purchase the tickets they want?​</a>

A sample of n=25 is selected from a normal population, = 56 and s= 12.2. Based on the report of the school nurse, the average height of Grade 11 students hasincreased. Five years ago, the average height of Grade 11 students was 170cm with standard deviation of38cm. She took a random sample of 150 students and derived the average height of 165cm.3. Knowing from a previous study that the average of athletes is 80, an athletic adviser askedhow his soccer players are academically doing as compared to other student athletes. After an initiative tohelp improve the average of student athletes, the adviser randomly selected 15 soccer players and found85 as the average with standard deviation of 1.25.4. The CEO of a battery manufacturing company claimed that their batteries would last anaverage of 280 hours under normal use. A researcher randomly selected 20 batteries from the productionline and tested them. The tested batteries had a mean life span of 250 hours with a standard deviation of40 hours. Do we have enough evidence to suggest that the claim of an average of 280 hours is false?5. It was known that the number of tickets purchased by students at the ticket window forthe volleyball match of two popular universities followed a distribution that has mean of 500 and standarddeviation of 8.9.

                            9. h Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 30) — NEW COVID-19 cases in the country hit another grim record on Monday, with 22,366 infections reported by the Department of Health. This is the first time singlo-day cauen topped 20,000, beating the previous record of 19,441 recorded on Saturday, Aug, 28. It also marked the fourth time this month that the daily count reached an all-time high. The total case tally rose to 1,976,202, of which 148,594 or 7.5% are active cases. Of the currently III , 95.7% exhibit mild symptoms, 1.7% are asymptomatic , 0.97% are moderate cases, 1.1% are severe, and 0.6% are critical. Data from two non-reporting testing laboratories were not part of the count, the DOH noted. The two contribute around 0.1% of samples tested and 0.1% of positive individuals, based on department data over the last two weeks. The death toll also struck 33,330 with 222 more fatalities, including 105 earlier classified as recoveries. This is the thirteenth consecutive day the country saw a triple-digit increase in deaths. Meanwhile, 16,864 were added to the survivor count, which has reached 1,794,278. These mean COVID-19 has killed 1.69% of all confirmed patients nationwide, while 90.8% have gotten well. After final validation, the DOH also sald it deleted 187 duplicates, including 174 recoveries and a death. Its report further showed 65,237 COVID-19 tests were reported on Aug. 28, with 27.5% turning out positive. A positivity rate of above 20% is considered "critical level" and indicates inadequate testing efforts, according to the U.S. nonprofit Covid Act Now. This lack of sufficient testing also suggests that new cases and the infection rate are actually higher than what is currently reported, the organization explained. he DOH has earlier warned fresh cases may continue to climb in the following days. On Sunday, it also ported that around 69%, or 516, of the 748 samples in the latest batch of whole genome sequencing were und to be of the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant spite the rising numbers, the independent group OCTA Research said Metro Manila may see a downward nd in infections by mid-September, although it said hospitals will likely continue to deal with a high level of upancy rate. ir Summary:​</h2><br />

                            10. The Southwest shrub Juniperus communis (Juniper Berry) has many significant medicinal value in the Native American culture that has not been proven scientifically. One of the popular uses of Juniper berries aside from its detoxifying action is its potential to repel insects. This study focuses on the development of insect repellant from its essential oil obtained through steam distillation. 50 g of fresh berries was collected and dried for 5 days and is placed in a still tank with 100 mL of water for steam distillation using the Flinn Scientific Borosilicate Lab Kit. Gather the extracted oil and dilute 70% in three separate containers to be transferred into spray bottles. Testing involved the spraying of the dilute sample into a class jar with Anopheles juidthae (common NM mosquito) and compared this to the effect of a commercial insect repellant. After testing and comparing the result, the commercial insect repellant significantly showed that it is a better insect repellant compared to the J. communis diluted essential oil. However, the essential oil has also an insect repellant potential. Activity: Analysis of the Text Directions: Answer the following questions. 1. What kind of text is this? 2.

                            20. DETERMINATION OF DENSITIES DISCUSSION :The density of an object is defined as its mass per unit volume. Mathematically it can be expressed as:  Formula : D= M/V Where : D= density , M= mass , V= volume This usually expressed as grams per millilter (g/ml ) for liquids , grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) for solid , and grams per Liter (g/L) for gases.I. OBJECTIVES :  After completing the activity , you should be able to:1. Learn the proper technique in measuring the mass and the volume ;2. Determine the densities of some solids and liquids , and3. Apply the rules of significant figures when reporting the weight, volume and density of each material. II- INSTRUCTION :1.0 DENSITY OF LIQUIDS:1.1 Density of water To determine the density of water , first is to get the mass of the water based from the given value below by obtaining the difference from the mass of empty cylinder and mass of the graduated and water . Assume that the volume of water is 40 ml . Compute its density .1.2 Density of colored liquid (KMnO4)To determine the density of KMnO4 , first is to get the mass of the liquid based from the given value below, by obtaining the difference from the mass of empty cylinder and mass of the graduated and KMnO4 . Assume that the volume of KMnO4 is 5 ml . Compute its density .2. 0 Density of Solids2.1 Density of regulary shaped solid  The mass of the wood is already given , determine the volume of the block of wood by following the formula below. Volume of the block of wood = LXWXH Compute its density .2.2 Density of the Irregularly shaped solid ( green jade sample ) To get the volume of the irregularly shaped solid, perform using the water displacement method. Compute the density by using the given value for the mass . II.
