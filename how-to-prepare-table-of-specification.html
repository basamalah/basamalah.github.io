6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</a>

                                            Why it is important to know and understand by the waiter or server the establishment guidelines in operating ordering system?​essay: Every establishment has a specific protocol for taking orders from the table and giving them to the kitchen and assembly areas. A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. Asking for your order to be a "rush" order is not a good idea, unless there is a really good reason for it. Servers who are always "rush" orders will find themselves placed at the back of the queue, more often than not.Orders can be written on checks, the duplicate of which is given to the kitchen. If handwriting orders, your handwriting must be legible and easy to understand. Always use the appropriate abbreviations; do not make up your own -- the kitchen will not understand them. Keep your original check or ticket as this is your record of the food that you have ordered from the kitchen, and from which the final bill will be prepared. Never throw these away. If a mistake has been made, run a line through the mistake, and, if necessary, have the manager initial it.More and more restaurants are using a Point of Service computer where you will enter the order from your table and it is automatically delivered via the computer to the kitchen.Your biggest job will be the timing of your orders. Make a point of learning how long it takes to prepare any given dish, then put in the order for the one that takes the longest to prepare first. That way, all dinners for a given table should come out at the same time. Nothing is more uncomfortable for your guests than to serve three guests at a table, only to find out that the fourth guest's meal has not yet been started.The next point that requires your attention is to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Not only is this necessary for food safety, it also helps to preserve the beauty of the prepared food.There is nothing more unappetizing than to have a cold pat of butter melting on the bread and butter plate because it was served hot. It is your job to ensure that the food arrives at the table in the condition in which it was served from the kitchen.yan po sagot ko </a>

C. The scientist works alone in a lab until he makes a dramatic breakthrough and then immediately announces the results through a worldwide press conference.
D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
6. A recent encyclopedia entry about dogs cites multiple research papers done by scientists at veterinary schools. According to the article, Labrador retrievers come in two specific breeds: English and American. The English breed is described as stocky and heavy, while the American breed is described as tall and lanky. The article describes current scientific research as showing that males of both breeds usually weigh about 29-41 kg (65-90 lb), and females weigh 25-32 kg (55-70 lb). Coat colors for both breeds come in solid black, yellow, or chocolate. All labs have strong tails and webbed feet, which help them swim. Devon would like to use this information to determine if his new dog is an English or American Labrador retriever. 
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.
C. It is reliable because the article is based on multiple studies done by scientists at multiple veterinary schools.
D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>1. D. </strong>We are given a solution that is 2.50 L, and the conversion that 1 quart =0.943 liters. Now, to convert, we can just multiply 2.50 L x (1 quart / 0.943 L) = 2.65 quarts. Note how the "liters unit" is cancelled and we are left with quarts.</p><br /><p><strong>2. D. </strong> What is one advantage of using a computer over a graphing calculator?
</p><p>A. Computers are more useful for quick calculations.
</p><p>B. Computers are easier to transport to remote locations.
</p><p>C. Computers have lower power consumption.
</p><p>D. Computers hold larger amounts of data.</p><p>Options  A-C are actually advantages of a graphing calculator. Because it is more portable (B), it is easier to use for quick calculations (A). Since it's also smaller, it has a lower power consumption (C). Computers, however, because of their computing capacity can hold larger amounts of data.</p><br /><p><strong>3. C.</strong> Which of these steps would most likely be part of a lab procedure?
</p><p>A. Write a hypothesis to answer a question.
</p><p>B. Write a title at the top of a completed lab report.
</p><p>C. Record the time to complete a chemical reaction.
</p><p>D. Create a question on the cause of a chemical reaction.</p><p>Options A, B, and D are part of pre-lab and post-lab procedures. Only option C  actually needs to be done during the experiment. You'd need A and D (hypothesis and question) before lab, to know what to test. Option B would come after the lab experiment, because there is already a completed lab report.</p><br /><p><strong>4.C.</strong> A scientist collected the following data, which show how the pressure of water vapor changes with temperature.
</p><p>
What would a scientist do to best communicate these data to other scientists in a presentation?
</p><p>A. Replace the table with text highlighting pressures.
</p><p>B. Change the unit of pressure to atm.
</p><p>C. Make a graph for better visual representation.
</p><p>D. Display only rows 1, 3, and 6 of the data to simplify results.
</p><p>The data shows the relation of pressure and temperature, and the relationship between two quantities is best shown as a graph. Options A,B and D will still just give a lot of numbers which a layperson would probably have a difficult time understanding. Option D especially is a big NO, because you shouldn't just remove data like that. More than simplifying the results, it would change the results.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5. A. </strong>A filmmaker wants to depict a realistic dramatization of a scientist making and communicating an important scientific discovery. Which plot description would best depict the methods of discovery and communication that a modern professional scientist uses?
</p><p>A. The scientist collaborates with others to plan and carry out an experiment and then writes a paper that has a clear conclusion. He submits it to a professional journal for peer review, after which the results are presented apublicly.

</p><p>D. The scientist seeks input and data from a wide range of people of different scientific backgrounds and then publishes all the data and results on the Internet so that all the collaborators can apply it to their individual research.
</p><p>Option A is the answer because it is the only one that mentions peer reviews before releasing results. This is an important part of scientists discoveries since the discovery must be double-checked first before announced. It would just cause confusion if a scientist announces a wrong discovery.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>6. C. </strong>  
Which best describes the reliability of the information?
</p><p>A. It is not reliable because only scientists can use scientific information for reference.
</p><p>B. It is not reliable because it doesn’t talk about how to test and only gives data about the breeds.

</p><p>D. It is reliable because it gives information about both types of Labradors in addition to information about other types of dogs.
</p><p>Options B and D talk more about the completeness of the information rather than the reliability. Option A is not true, since scientific information can be used by anyone as reference. Option C is true since having multiple sources confirm the same thing makes it more reliable than just a single source. This is connected to the importance of peer reviews in number 5.</p><br /><p>Some additional sources:</p><p>Example on conversion: https://brainly.ph/question/86333</p><p>Data presentation: https://brainly.ph/question/1577588</p><p>Laboratory Equipment: https://brainly.ph/question/627413</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><br />

                            14. Why it is important to know and understand by the waiter or server the establishment guidelines in operating ordering system?​essay: Every establishment has a specific protocol for taking orders from the table and giving them to the kitchen and assembly areas. A new server needs to learn this protocol as quickly as possible in order to be an efficient team member. Asking for your order to be a "rush" order is not a good idea, unless there is a really good reason for it. Servers who are always "rush" orders will find themselves placed at the back of the queue, more often than not.Orders can be written on checks, the duplicate of which is given to the kitchen. If handwriting orders, your handwriting must be legible and easy to understand. Always use the appropriate abbreviations; do not make up your own -- the kitchen will not understand them. Keep your original check or ticket as this is your record of the food that you have ordered from the kitchen, and from which the final bill will be prepared. Never throw these away. If a mistake has been made, run a line through the mistake, and, if necessary, have the manager initial it.More and more restaurants are using a Point of Service computer where you will enter the order from your table and it is automatically delivered via the computer to the kitchen.Your biggest job will be the timing of your orders. Make a point of learning how long it takes to prepare any given dish, then put in the order for the one that takes the longest to prepare first. That way, all dinners for a given table should come out at the same time. Nothing is more uncomfortable for your guests than to serve three guests at a table, only to find out that the fourth guest's meal has not yet been started.The next point that requires your attention is to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Not only is this necessary for food safety, it also helps to preserve the beauty of the prepared food.There is nothing more unappetizing than to have a cold pat of butter melting on the bread and butter plate because it was served hot. It is your job to ensure that the food arrives at the table in the condition in which it was served from the kitchen.yan po sagot ko </h2><br />
