                                            The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The political dimension of clothing is intuitively understood from the moment individuals are born. Because essentially, human society equals dressed society. What one wears, how one wears it and when one wears it constitutes expressions of degrees of social freedoms and influences.
</p><p>
</p><p>Dress expression ranges the full political gamut from conformity to rebellion. Simply put, dress style that challenges — or is perceived as challenging, or offering an alternative to the status quo — spontaneously acquires political meaning.
</p><p>
</p><p>Hence the social power of dress and the political impact of seeing many people dressed in an agreed-upon mode. During the counter-demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, antifa protesters opposing white supremacists wore “black bloc” — an all-black uniform of sorts, meant to show a unified hard stance against anti-Black racist discourse.
</p><p>
</p><p>Simultaneously, “black bloc” dress indicated a willingness to resort to violence if necessary, much like the Black Panthers did in the 1960s and 70s. The Panthers took advantage of a loophole in the second amendment of the U.S. constitution that made it lawful to wear unconcealed firearms in public.</p><p></p><p>HOPE THAT IT CAN HELP: )</p><br />

                            7. The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</h2><br />

                            11. Give 3 examples of social inequality in the Philippines and write the possible organization that has the capability in solving the problem​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer: Poverty doesn't just make it difficult for families to survive, it can also have much wider economic impact. In the Philippines, where more than a quarter of the country's population of 92.3 million lives below the poverty line, economic and social inequality is a major problem. The Philippines has one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world, and unless action is taken, the gap will continue to widen. ChildFund has operated in the Philippines since 1954 and works to ensure the nation's poorest children and their families have access to the food, health care and education they need to survive. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:sorry po yan lang po ang nanalaman ko po sa tanong nyo po :&lt;</strong></p><p></p><br />
