                        <p></p><p>Story of the Wooden Bowl</p><p>A frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and four-year-old grandson. The old man’s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table.  But the elderly grandfather’s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.</p><p></p><p>The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. “We must do something about father,” said the son. “I’ve had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor.”  So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner.</p><p></p><p>wooden bowl</p><p>There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl!  When the family glanced in Grandfather’s direction, sometimes he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food.</p><p>The four-year-old watched it all in silence.</p><p></p><p>One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?”  Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up.” The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.</p><p></p><p>The words so struck the parents so that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done.</p><p></p><p>That evening the husband took Grandfather’s hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his day, he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled</p><br />

                        <p><strong>E</strong><strong>x</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p> </p><p>Once upon a time, there was a couple who only had one child. In their old age, they can only earn their daily food. </p><p></p><p>There child was a beautiful, gentle and good maiden that nobody is more beautiful than her. His father died because he was sick and he was old. When her father died, she and her mother need to work harder to provide their daily needs. Soon, her mother's strength was failing and she leave her child all alone in this world.</p><p></p><p>Before her mother died, she called her child to sit at the bedside. Her mother was too worried of her child's future and she was afraid that because of the beauty her child has , it might destroy her future. So, she decided to put a bowl in the maiden's head and told her not to remove the wooden bowl.</p><p></p><p>While she was working on the rice field, most of the people noticed the bowl on her head and so, she was known all over the place as the "Maid with the Wooden Bowl on the Head. The people who saw her, will laugh but one man tried to make fun of her. He tried to peep under the bowl and even trying to remove the bowl on the maiden's head.</p><p></p><p>One day, as the maiden was working on the rice field of a rich farmer, the owner walk closely towards her. He was struck by the behavior of the maiden and of how diligent she was while working.</p><p></p><p>Watching the maiden all day long, the owner was pleased and kept looking at the girl until the end of harvest season. </p><p></p><p>During the winter season, the maiden live at the farmer's house because she was asked to be with the farmer's wife who is sick. Since the farmer and his wife had no child, they loved the maiden more than a hired servant.</p><p></p><p>After some time, the son of the farmer went home to visit his mother and father. Their son was living at Kioto because he studied there. The farmer's son was happy upon arriving home. When he arrived, he was also struck by the maiden with a wooden bowl on the head. He asked the maiden if who she was, what she was and why she was always seen with a headdress.</p><p></p><p>He was touched by the maiden's story but he could not help laughing at the maiden. As the days passed by, he was not able to laugh at the maiden because of her good manners. One day, having managed to take a peep on the maiden's bowl, he had seen enough beauty of the maiden that made him fall in love. </p><p></p><p>From that moment on, he decided to marry the maiden but the girl refuses because she was only a servant but as she was sleeping , she saw her mother on her dream and told her to marry the farmer's son because her life will be so good.</p><p></p><p>So, she marry the farmer's son. When she was about to drink the wine, the bowl in his head broke and the golds and silvers inside the bowl fell on the floor. </p><p></p><p>Everyone was astonished of her beauty that no one had ever seen it. Then they all said that the maiden was the most beautiful woman in Japan.</p><p></p><p>Moral Lesson:</p><p>                Don't judge a person on it's physical appearance because the beauty of a person doesn't depend on the physical appearance, it depends on his/her attitude.</p><br />

The old man’s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table.  But the elderly grandfather’s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.</p><p>The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. “We must do something about father,” said the son. “I’ve had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor.”  So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl!  When the family glanced in Grandfather’s direction, sometimes he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food.</p><p>The four-year-old watched it all in silence.</p><p>One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?”  Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up.” The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.</p><p>The words so struck the parents so that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done.</p><p>That evening the husband took Grandfather’s hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his day, he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.</p><p></p><p></p>Moral:<p>Moral: You reap what you sow.
