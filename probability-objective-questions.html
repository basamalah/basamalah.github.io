                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Organ system involved when you eat.</p><p>Digestive and muscular systems would be working together to chew food and work it down to the stomach to be digested. The digestive system and circulatory circulatory system would be working together to break food down and move nutrients to cells. The nervous system decides what to eat and when to chew.</p><p>Organ system involved when you sleep</p><p>Your sympathetic nervous system chills out</p><p>During sleep, your sympathetic nervous system – which controls your fight or flight response – gets a chance to relax</p><p>Organ system involved when you run</p><p>Muscular system</p><p>Skeletal muscles connect to the bone and work hand-in-hand with the skeletal system to control voluntary movement such as walking and running.
