                                            There’s nothing quite like the apprehension and excitement I feel whenever I know that abig change is going to happen in my life. Just last week, I finally started going to school. I’vebeen homeschooled for the past few years, so when my parents broke the news to me thatI’ve passed Windridge Valley High School’s entrance exam, I was ecstatic and nervous at thesame time. I did, however, make sure to prepare.First, I called my cousin Ella, who has been studying at Windridge for the past two years. Wewere on the same grade level, so I asked her to tell me what going there was like. I made hertell me stories about her friends and teachers. She indulged me with stories then told menot to worry, as she thinks I’d fit right in with her friend group, and she would make sure Icould sit with them at lunch if I find myself not having anyone to sit with during the first fewdays. You see, we were put in different sections so I was still apprehensive. What if I didn’tmake any friends?My first day at school came and went, and it turns out that Ella was right. I needn’t haveworried. During my first class, our teacher asked us to introduce ourselves. I then found outthat another girl in my class, Samantha, is a new student who was just starting at schoolsince she was homeschooled in the past years. After learning that we had that in common,our teacher seated us together. And even though I’ve only known her for a week, I could tell that Samantha and I are going to be friends for a long time. Everyone else has been reallynice to me too. Now I look forward to going to school each day1. What pattern of paragraph development is used in the given passage? *2.

D One contemporary proof of this claim is a 24-year old Filipino named Joaquin Pedro Gomez Valdes. He finished a degree in Film and Audio-Visual Communication at the University of the Philippines. As part of his graduation requirements, he needed to submit a major project called a "thesis".. He then set his creativity to work and came up with a short film entitled "Bulong" (Whisper). He submitted his work to different international competitions, a couple of months after its completion. His efforts paid off when "Bulong" which talked about life's purpose and the people's freedom whether to live that purpose or not, was named "Best Thesis". It was also given the "Felicianio Award". It gained recognition abroad when it was chosen to represent the Philippines in the prestigious Short Film Corner, Festival de Cannes, in France. It also won the Best Short Narrative in New Beijing International Movie Week. Joaquin Valdez, exemplifying excellence, made something not just to meet requirements in order to graduate. He made a short film that brought pride to the country. He exemplifies a "world class" Filipino. 1.Why did Joaquin Valdez receive the awards mentioned for his short film? 2.What does the word "thesis" mean in the selection? 3.When Joaquin Valdez submitted his work to different international competitions, what character trait did he show? 4.As a student, how can you show creativity in your work? 5.

                                            Michael's English teacher announced that their test would be given on Monday.As she walked around the class, she handed out a study guide. "You will complete this studyguide at home tonight. It is due tomorrow. I want to go over it together as a class so you haveenough time to study through the week," Mrs. Reyes explained. "Do your best. This studyguide looks a lot like the test." English was difficult for Michael, so he was nervous about thetest on Monday. With the right answers on his study guide,Michael went to his room every night that week and studied. He looked at theproblems over and over. It didn't seem to be helping, though. Michael was still very nervousand he felt unprepared. On Monday, Michael took his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest girl in thegrade. He glanced over at her paper at the very beginning. He wanted to make surehe got them right. When his answer did not match the gir's, he changed his answer. Thepaper came back with a 100. However, Michael's guilt felt heauy in his chest. He didn'tearn that grade, so he couldn't be proud of himself for that.1.What does this story remind you of?,2.Can you relate to the characters in the story?3.Does anything in this story remind you of anything in your own life?_​</a>

We are in school because we want to learn. Our study is for our own benefit and not to reports. Putting a valuation upon it in terms of five, ten or twenty years from now will give it more meaning TO US. future. The facts, ideas, and principles we acquire now are the stuff with which we will do our thinking in the Let's remember, too, that how we leam is sometimes more important than what we learn. An efficient working method will serve us throughout life, but many of the things we learn will just be forgotten. Being systematic about study will do a lot. Habit then comes to our aid.

With the right answers on his study guide,Michael went to his room every night that week and studied. He looked at theproblems over and over. It didn't seem to be helping, though. Michael was still very nervousand he felt unprepared. On Monday, Michael took his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest girl in thegrade. He glanced over at her paper at the very beginning. He wanted to make surehe got them right. When his answer did not match the gir's, he changed his answer. Thepaper came back with a 100. However, Michael's guilt felt heauy in his chest.

                                            There’s nothing quite like the apprehension and excitement I feel whenever I know that a
big change is going to happen in my life. Just last week, I finally started going to school. I’ve
been homeschooled for the past few years, so when my parents broke the news to me that
I’ve passed Windridge Valley High School’s entrance exam, I was ecstatic and nervous at the
same time. I did, however, make sure to prepare.
First, I called my cousin Ella, who has been studying at Windridge for the past two years. We
were on the same grade level, so I asked her to tell me what going there was like. I made her
tell me stories about her friends and teachers. She indulged me with stories then told me
not to worry, as she thinks I’d fit right in with her friend group, and she would make sure I
could sit with them at lunch if I find myself not having anyone to sit with during the first few
days. You see, we were put in different sections so I was still apprehensive. What if I didn’t
make any friends?
My first day at school came and went, and it turns out that Ella was right. I needn’t have
worried. During my first class, our teacher asked us to introduce ourselves. I then found out
that another girl in my class, Samantha, is a new student who was just starting at school
since she was homeschooled in the past years. After learning that we had that in common,
our teacher seated us together. And even though I’ve only known her for a week, I could tell

that Samantha and I are going to be friends for a long time. Everyone else has been really
nice to me too. Now I look forward to going to school each day.

                            4. There’s nothing quite like the apprehension and excitement I feel whenever I know that abig change is going to happen in my life. Just last week, I finally started going to school. I’vebeen homeschooled for the past few years, so when my parents broke the news to me thatI’ve passed Windridge Valley High School’s entrance exam, I was ecstatic and nervous at thesame time. I did, however, make sure to prepare.First, I called my cousin Ella, who has been studying at Windridge for the past two years. Wewere on the same grade level, so I asked her to tell me what going there was like. I made hertell me stories about her friends and teachers. She indulged me with stories then told menot to worry, as she thinks I’d fit right in with her friend group, and she would make sure Icould sit with them at lunch if I find myself not having anyone to sit with during the first fewdays. You see, we were put in different sections so I was still apprehensive. What if I didn’tmake any friends?My first day at school came and went, and it turns out that Ella was right. I needn’t haveworried. During my first class, our teacher asked us to introduce ourselves. I then found outthat another girl in my class, Samantha, is a new student who was just starting at schoolsince she was homeschooled in the past years. After learning that we had that in common,our teacher seated us together. And even though I’ve only known her for a week, I could tell that Samantha and I are going to be friends for a long time. Everyone else has been reallynice to me too. Now I look forward to going to school each day1. What pattern of paragraph development is used in the given passage? *2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I felt very proud of myself because in my opinion, I think that I have made something worth of praising myself. I felt a sense of achievement that I haven't always had and that makes it more of something I can be happy of. It might be little to you but it's best to appreciate the little things since it makes life at least a little bit more colorful.</p><p>2. Shoes don't last for long since our foot size changes as we grow older. A phone in the otherhand can be used in different ways and can last until we reach the age of working amd independence. I have to prioritize what I can make use of and since my education is involved, I have to choose that side because our system needs education and something we can poudly write on our resumé in the far future.</p><p>3.

                            28. Michael's English teacher announced that their test would be given on Monday.As she walked around the class, she handed out a study guide. "You will complete this studyguide at home tonight. It is due tomorrow. I want to go over it together as a class so you haveenough time to study through the week," Mrs. Reyes explained. "Do your best. This studyguide looks a lot like the test." English was difficult for Michael, so he was nervous about thetest on Monday. With the right answers on his study guide,Michael went to his room every night that week and studied. He looked at theproblems over and over. It didn't seem to be helping, though. Michael was still very nervousand he felt unprepared. On Monday, Michael took his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest girl in thegrade. He glanced over at her paper at the very beginning. He wanted to make surehe got them right. When his answer did not match the gir's, he changed his answer. Thepaper came back with a 100. However, Michael's guilt felt heauy in his chest. He didn'tearn that grade, so he couldn't be proud of himself for that.1.What does this story remind you of?,2.Can you relate to the characters in the story?3.Does anything in this story remind you of anything in your own life?_​</h2><br />

                            30. There’s nothing quite like the apprehension and excitement I feel whenever I know that a
big change is going to happen in my life. Just last week, I finally started going to school. I’ve
been homeschooled for the past few years, so when my parents broke the news to me that
I’ve passed Windridge Valley High School’s entrance exam, I was ecstatic and nervous at the
same time. I did, however, make sure to prepare.
First, I called my cousin Ella, who has been studying at Windridge for the past two years. We
were on the same grade level, so I asked her to tell me what going there was like. I made her
tell me stories about her friends and teachers. She indulged me with stories then told me
not to worry, as she thinks I’d fit right in with her friend group, and she would make sure I
could sit with them at lunch if I find myself not having anyone to sit with during the first few
days. You see, we were put in different sections so I was still apprehensive. What if I didn’t
make any friends?
My first day at school came and went, and it turns out that Ella was right. I needn’t have
worried. During my first class, our teacher asked us to introduce ourselves. I then found out
that another girl in my class, Samantha, is a new student who was just starting at school
since she was homeschooled in the past years. After learning that we had that in common,
our teacher seated us together. And even though I’ve only known her for a week, I could tell

that Samantha and I are going to be friends for a long time. Everyone else has been really
nice to me too. Now I look forward to going to school each day.
