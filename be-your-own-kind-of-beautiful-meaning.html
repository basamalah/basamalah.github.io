9.Lightning and thunder are related events. 
Lightning is a sudden, violent
flash of electricity that occurs between a cloud and the ground or
between two clouds in the sky. A lightning bolt can be several miles long
and can be straight or forked. It is very hot, with an average temperature
of 34 000 degrees Celsius. This causes the air around the electric bolt

10.All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically.
Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the

not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter
into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when
paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again.</a>
