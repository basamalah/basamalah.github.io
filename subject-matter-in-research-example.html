As a teacher, you should be aware on the diversities of thelearners or the types of learners that you have in your dass. There are students who prefer visual learning. Theylike seeing and observing things, including pictures, diagrams, written directions and more. Some tend to leambetter when the subject matter is reinforced by sound which is called the auditory learners, Kinesthetic learnerssometimes called tactile learners, learn through experiencing or doing things. The last one is the easiest to cater tosince much of the traditional educational system tends to center on writing essays, doing research and readingbooks. These types of learners are called reading/writing learners.Signature of parent/guardian:​</a>

If in sampling for the evaluation of a food product, the researcher was required to have at least 1000 respondents. _________2. If in determining the attitude of students toward increases in tuition and other school fees, the respondents were grouped into 1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year and 4th year. _________3. If in environmental impact assessment of a proposed garbage dumping site, the opinions of individuals are not so relevant as the opinions of groups, e.g. a barangay or an organization. _________4. The names comprising the population of students in a school are numbered from 1 to n and a sample is drawn using random numbers taken from the calculators. _________5. Telephone surveys roadside sampling, selecting the nearest elements are examples. _________6. All employees of the company are listed in alphabetical order. From the first 10 numbers, you randomly select a starting point: number 6. From number 6 onwards, every 10th person on the list is selected (6, 16, 26, 36, and so on), and you end up with a sample of 100 people. _________7. The company has 800 female employees and 200 male employees. You want to ensure that the sample reflects the gender balance of the company, so you sort the population into two strata based on gender. Then you use random sampling on each group, selecting 80 women and 20 men, which gives you a representative sample of 100 people. _________8.An organization is looking to survey the performance of smartphones across Philippines. They divided the entire country’s population into cities and select further towns with the highest population and also filter those using mobile devices. _________9. The sample is drawn from the part of the population having the characteristic that is relevant to the purpose and subject matter of the study being conducted. _________10.
