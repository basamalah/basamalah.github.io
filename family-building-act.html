                                            please help me to explain this paragraphFamily Protection. The security and protection of the individual and of the family is one of the most important aspects of life. Safety primarily means preventing any risks to the personal safety. Protecting the family against criminals, catastrophes , and wars and warlike events is a basic requirement. Family Security - Your family security plan may include a monitored home security alarm system that alerts local police or fire departments when the alarm is triggered, in addition to sounding a piercing alarm at the home. Some feel that a monitored system is the best home security system. Fire detection systems are designed to discover fires early in their development when time will still be available for the safe evacuation of occupants. Early detection also plays a significant role in protecting the safety of emergency responsepersonnel. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small. Most alarm systems provide information to emergency responders on the location of the fire, speeding the process of fire control. To be useful, detectors must be coupled with alarms. Alarm systems provide notice to at least the building occupants and usually transmit a signal to a staffed monitoring station either on or off site. In some cases, alarms may go directly to the fire department, although in most locations this is no longer the typical approach. These systems have numerous advantages as discussed above. The one major limitation is that they do nothing to contain or control the fire. Suppression systems such as automatic sprinklers act to control the fire. They also provide notification that they are operating, so they can fill the role of a heat detection-based system if connected to notification appliances throughout the building. They will not, however, operate as quickly as a smoke detection system. This is why facilities where rapid notice is essential, even when equipped with sprinklers, still need detection and alarm systems. A device which can detect a fire, and provide a signal to an alarm circuit. Fire detectors can be operated by smoke, flames, and heat, or any combination of these factors. Flame detectors are rarely used on board ships these days. Heat detectors are used in places such as the galley and laundry. Smoke detectors are used in machinery spaces, accommodation areas and cargo holds.​</a>

                            5. please help me to explain this paragraphFamily Protection. The security and protection of the individual and of the family is one of the most important aspects of life. Safety primarily means preventing any risks to the personal safety. Protecting the family against criminals, catastrophes , and wars and warlike events is a basic requirement. Family Security - Your family security plan may include a monitored home security alarm system that alerts local police or fire departments when the alarm is triggered, in addition to sounding a piercing alarm at the home. Some feel that a monitored system is the best home security system. Fire detection systems are designed to discover fires early in their development when time will still be available for the safe evacuation of occupants. Early detection also plays a significant role in protecting the safety of emergency responsepersonnel. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small. Most alarm systems provide information to emergency responders on the location of the fire, speeding the process of fire control. To be useful, detectors must be coupled with alarms. Alarm systems provide notice to at least the building occupants and usually transmit a signal to a staffed monitoring station either on or off site. In some cases, alarms may go directly to the fire department, although in most locations this is no longer the typical approach. These systems have numerous advantages as discussed above. The one major limitation is that they do nothing to contain or control the fire. Suppression systems such as automatic sprinklers act to control the fire. They also provide notification that they are operating, so they can fill the role of a heat detection-based system if connected to notification appliances throughout the building. They will not, however, operate as quickly as a smoke detection system. This is why facilities where rapid notice is essential, even when equipped with sprinklers, still need detection and alarm systems. A device which can detect a fire, and provide a signal to an alarm circuit. Fire detectors can be operated by smoke, flames, and heat, or any combination of these factors. Flame detectors are rarely used on board ships these days. Heat detectors are used in places such as the galley and laundry. Smoke detectors are used in machinery spaces, accommodation areas and cargo holds.​</h2><br />
