                                            Direction:Read the following statement. Identify the advantages and disadvantages of using geothermal energy. Color the star yellow ( ) if the statement is an advantage. If not, color the minus sign red ( ).1. Geothermal energy is extracted from the earth without burning fossil fuels and practically less to no emissions of greenhouse gases.2. Man cannot just build a geothermal power plant in some vacant land plot in all regions of Earth.3. During the installation of power plant there are gases released into the atmosphere during digging.4. Geothermal energy is a naturally occurring resource there is no fuel required.5. High investment costs for the geothermal systems and there is no guarantee that the amount of energy to be harnessed could justify the capital and expenditure and operation costs.6. Geothermal reservoirs are naturally replenished. Geothermal energy is a source of renewable energy that will last for a long time.7. Cost-effective, since it can be extracted locally, the government need not import fuel for geothermal power plants. The economic benefits remain in the region. 8. Geothermal energy also runs the risk of triggering earthquakes, due to alterations in the Earth’s structure as a result of digging. 9. It will not be used up for a long period time. It provides a reliable source of energy as compared to other renewable resources.10. To maintain the sustainability of geothermal energy fluid needs to be pumped back into the underground reservoirs faster than it is depleted. It needs to be properly managed to maintain its sustainability.

                                            Patulong uli thank you! 1. This is the simplest and easiest system of plantation. The trees are planted in four corners to keep the same distance between rows and from plant to plant in the same row. a. Contour system b. Hexagonal System c. Rectangular system d. Square system 2. Below are the advantages of a square system, which of the following is not included? a. Better supervision of the orchard is possible. b. Certain amount of space in the middle of four trees is wasted c. Irrigation channels and paths can be made straight. d. Operations like plowing, harrowing, cultivating and harvesting becomes easy. 3. It is a system where trees are planted in same way as in a square system except that the distance between rows will be more than the distance between plants in the same row. a. Hexagonal system b. Quincunx system c. Rectangular system d. Square system 4. It is desirable to have the trees planted in a systematic way due to the following reasons: I. Orchard operations like intercultural and irrigation are carried out easily. II. It makes possible the distribution of areas equally for each tree. III. It makes supervision easier and more effective. IV. It is well-arranged and nice to look at a. I &amp; II b. II, III &amp; IV c. III &amp; IV d. I, II &amp; III 5. It is an imaginary line connecting all points of equal elevation across a slope. a. Contour system b. Hexagonal system c. Quincunx system d. Square system 6. The following are few common steps in the layout procedure for different system except one. a. Measure the land b. Prepare a plan on the paper marking details c. Decide the types of trees to be planted d. Conduct a survey 7. Basically, this system is the same as the square system except for the addition of a tree in the middle of each square. The number of trees planted in the same area is almost double. a. Hexagonal system b. Quincunx system c. Rectangular system d. Square system 8. Which of the following is the disadvantage of contour system? a. Laying out of contour line is difficult and time consuming. b. Contour system can control the soil erosion c. It helps simultaneously in the conservation of water. d. It can be adopted in hilly regions and in leveled land. 9. A system where the trees are planted at the corners of an equilateral triangle. a. Contour system b. Hexagonal system c. Quincunx system d. Square system 10. What do you call the additional tree in the center of a quincunx system? a. Filler b. Grower c. Filter d. Shelter​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Geothermal Energy is a sustainable and renewable energy source that is still largely untapped. As an environmentally-friendly resource it has the potential to meet heating, cooling and electricity demands for the future.</p><p></p><p>There are many advantages of geothermal energy but also some challenges that need to be overcome in order to fully exploit this natural resource.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>What are the Advantages of Using Geothermal?</p><p>1. Environmentally Friendly</p><p>Geothermal energy is more environmentally friendly than conventional fuel sources such as coal and other fossil fuels. In addition, the carbon footprint of a geothermal power plant is low. While there is some pollution associated with geothermal energy, this is relatively minimal when compared to fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>2. Renewable</p><p>Geothermal energy is a source of renewable energy that will last until the Earth is destroyed by the sun in around 5 billion years. The hot reservoirs within the Earth are naturally replenished, making it both renewable and sustainable.</p><p></p><p>3. Huge Potential</p><p>Worldwide energy consumption is currently around 15 terawatts, which is far from the total potential energy available from geothermal sources. While we can’t currently use most reservoirs there is a hope that the number of exploitable geothermal resources will increase with ongoing research and development in the industry. It is currently estimated that geothermal power plants could provide between 0.0035 and 2 terawatts of power.</p><p></p><p>4. Sustainable / Stable</p><p>Geothermal provides a reliable source of energy as compared to other renewable resources such as wind and solar power. This is because the resource is always available to be tapped into, unlike with wind or solar energy.</p><p></p><p>5. Heating and Cooling</p><p>Effective use of geothermal for electricity generation requires water temperatures of over 150°C to drive turbines. Alternatively, the temperature difference between the surface and a ground source can be used. Due to the ground being more resistant to seasonal heat changes than the air, it can act as a heat sink/ source with a geothermal heat pump just two metres below the surface.</p><p></p><p>6. Reliable</p><p>Energy generated from this resource is easy to calculate since it does not fluctuate in the same way as other energy sources, such as solar and wind. This means we can predict the power output from a geothermal plant with a high degree of accuracy.</p><p></p><p>7. No Fuel Required</p><p>Since geothermal energy is a naturally occurring resource there is no fuel required, such as with fossil fuels that are a finite resource which needs mining or otherwise extracting from the earth.</p><p></p><p>8. Rapid Evolution</p><p>There is a great deal of exploration into geothermal energy at the moment, meaning that new technologies are being created to improve the energy process. There are an increasing number of projects to improve and grow this area of industry. With this rapid evolution many of the current cons of geothermal energy will be mitigated against.</p><p></p><p>What are the Disadvantages of Geothermal Energy?</p><p>1. Location Restricted</p><p>The largest single disadvantage of geothermal energy is that it is location specific. Geothermal plants need to be built in places where the energy is accessible, which means that some areas are not able to exploit this resource. Of course, this is not a problem if you live in a place where geothermal energy is readily accessible, such as Iceland.</p><p></p><p>2. Environmental Side Effects</p><p>Although geothermal energy does not typically release greenhouse gases, there are many of these gases stored under the Earth’s surface which are released into the atmosphere during digging. While these gases are also released into the atmosphere naturally, the rate increases near geothermal plants. However, these gas emissions are still far lower than those associated with fossil fuels.</p><p></p><p>3. Earthquakes</p><p>Geothermal energy also runs the risk of triggering earthquakes. This is due to alterations in the Earth’s structure as a result of digging. This problem is more prevalent with enhanced geothermal power plants, which force water into the Earth’s crust to open up fissures to greater exploitation of the resource. However, since most geothermal plants are away from population centres, the implications of these earthquakes are relatively minor.</p><p></p><p>4. High Costs</p><p>Geothermal energy is an expensive resource to tap into, with price tags ranging from around $2-$7 million for a plant with a 1 megawatt capacity. However, where the upfront costs are high, the outlay can be recouped as part of a long-term investment.</p><p></p><p>5. Sustainability</p><p>In order to maintain the sustainability of geothermal energy fluid needs to be pumped back into the underground reservoirs faster than it is depleted. This means that geothermal energy needs to be properly managed to maintain its sustainability.</p><p></p><p>It is important for industry to assess the geothermal energy pros and cons in order to take account of the advantages while mitigating against any potential problems.</p><br />

You can make changes to a page layout by simply dragging the objects to their new positions.</p><p></p><p>3) Just as the arts are an expression of any society’s culture, the culture of this society - conversely - is the mirror and outcome of these arts. The interchangeable relationship between the arts - as a cultural value offered to the public - and the general population that interacts with and embodies these values must perpetually rise upwards and never deviate - even marginally - downwards, not only with respect to heightening the esteem and taste for aesthetic beauty, but also on other levels such as revering the value of morality, virtue, hard work, science, defense of the motherland, as well as all the other values representing the backbone of the success and development of any contemporary civilized society. Accordingly, the role of artists in all categories: plastic arts, music and singing, drama, and poetry must rise to become an influentially positive element that pushes and supports this interchangeable relationship upwards and never downwards, particularly since the majority of artists constitute the cream of society and are revered and admired by the public. In fact, ordinary people’s infatuation with artists in general puts a greater responsibility on their shoulders to serve as role models guiding societies towards cultural edification and enhancement.</p><p></p><p>4) Technology has become a pervasive influence in our society. It has especially influenced the way that we create and appreciate art. More artists are using Photoshop and digital cameras to create and edit pieces than ever before.

Of the Southeast Asian countries, East Timor most recently gained its independence, as was mentioned in the previous lesson. In comparing these island nations, extensive diversity in all aspects will be found. There are major differences in cultural, economic, and political dynamics, and in the ethnic groups that make up the dominant majorities in each. There is also a high level of linguistic and religious diversity. The physical geography varies from island to island; some have high mountain relief and others are low-lying and relatively flat. Active tectonic plate action in the region causes earthquakes and volcanic activity, resulting in destruction of infrastructure and loss of life; both acutely impact human activities.</p><br />
