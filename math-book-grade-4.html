If her previous grade was 85what is her new grade?2. A book previously sold for P500 is now priced at P350. What was thegiven discount rate?3. A salesman earned P15,000 commission which was 10% of his sales.How much was he able to sell?4. A 12% VAT will increase a ₱700 worth of groceries to how much?5. If a P10,000 deposit become P10,800 after a year, how much interest rate was given?INCORRECT ANSWER = REPORTCORRECT ANSWER = BRAINLIEST</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>interest was earned at an annual interest rate of 8%?</p><p></p><p>Ana's new grade is 89.25. To calculate, you can first find 5% of her previous grade by multiplying 85 by 0.05 to get 4.25. Then, you can add this amount to her previous grade: 85 + 4.25 = 89.25.</p><p></p><p>The discount rate is 30%. To calculate, you can first find the amount of the discount by subtracting the new price from the old price: 500 - 350 = 150. Then, you can calculate the discount rate by dividing the amount of the discount by the old price and multiplying by 100: (150/500) x 100 = 30%.</p><p></p><p>The salesman was able to sell P150,000 worth of goods. To calculate, you can use the formula: commission = rate x sales. Rearranging this formula to solve for sales, you get: sales = commission / rate. Substituting the given values, you get: sales = 15,000 / 0.1 = 150,000.</p><p></p><p>The groceries will now cost ₱784. To calculate, you can multiply the original price by 1 plus the VAT rate (expressed as a decimal): 700 x 1.12 = 784.</p><p></p><p>The interest earned is P800. To calculate, you can use the formula: interest = principal x rate x time. Substituting the given values, you get: interest = 10,000 x 0.08 x 1 = 800.</p><br />
