True</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>1. </strong>Studying history enables us to develop better understanding of the world in which we live. Building knowledge and understanding of historical events and trends, especially over the past century, enables us to develop a much greater appreciation for current events today.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Studying histories does not rely only on the main event, some studies and/or researchers are looking for a subject(usually things in the past that are being used for experiment for studies purposes.)</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Firstly, it helps us understand why historical events have been interpreted so differently over time. In other words, historiography helps us examine not only history itself, but also the broader overlying characteristics that shape the recording of history itself.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>The answer is that History is inescapable. It studies the past and the legacies of the past in the present. Far from being a 'dead' subject, it connects things through time and encourages its students to take a long view of such connections between the past, the present, and the future.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Histories, flashbacks and other things that represents the past life of both villains and heroes are limited, because most of movies, comics, novels have their characters, unique story flows, and unique ways of introducing the characters as part of it so. </p><p><strong>6. </strong>Primary sources are the raw materials of history  these are the original documents and objects that were created at the time under study. They are different from secondary sources, accounts that retell, analyze, or interpret events, usually at a distance of time or place.</p><p>Primary sources can be written or non-written (sound, pictures, artifacts, etc.). In scientific research, primary sources present original thinking, report on discoveries, or share new information.</p><p><strong>7. </strong>Yes It's true, there are currently 3 types of sources and these are: the primary sources, secondary sources, and tertiary sources.</p><p><strong>8. </strong>This statement is false. </p><p>In the study of history as an academic discipline, a primary source (also called an original source) is an artifact, document, diary, manuscript, autobiography, recording, or any other source of information that was created at the time under study. </p><p><strong>9.</strong>  The history is conducted by historians, individuals who take the time to research, interpret, and put past events into context in a very unique way.</p><p> History also refers to the study, knowledge, interpretation, and recording of the past.</p><p><strong>10. This statement is true.</strong></p><p>It is true that we cannot go back to the past, but with the help of historians and scientists, we are able to study it and it can help with things in the present and with things that may yet happen. and without studying the history, there would be no improvement or changes in every aspects of what we have nowadays, especially the equipment, technologies, buildings and structures, education system, machineries, foods, clothes, and so on.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
