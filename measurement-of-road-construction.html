The local government wants to build another road through the school that connects to this road but not go through the lake. The city engineer can measure the road that already exists, and he finds that the bridge portion of the road is 5 kilometers, and the portion of the road from the bridge to where the new road will be is 4 km. How long the road will be constructed. (Hint: Use tangent line).Pahelp naman need lang po​</a>

She needs to know the radius of the pool. but she does not want to get wet to take the measurements. She is standing 1.5 meter from the pool and 4.5 meter from the point of tangency. Find the radius of the pool.2. During the rainy season the water level in a certain lake rises. A road already exists through the school that goes over a circular lake. The local government wants to build another road through the school that connects to this road but not go through the lake. The city engineer can measure the road that already exists, and he finds that the bridge portion of the road is 5 kilometers, and the portion of the road from the bridge to where the new road will be is 4 km. How long the road will be constructed. (Hint: Use tangent line).Pls don't spam​</a>

PBB is a two-lane 3.7-kilometer extradosed-type bridge. You are working for DPWH and the project head requested you to approximate the number of bags of cement needed for the said project given that 6.5 bags of cement are needed for a 1-meter length of the bridge. You will present your computation to the project head the project head for validation.GOAL: your task is to approximate the number of bags of cement needed for the panguil bay bridge (PBB) Project. ROLE: you are an engineer working for DPWH. AUDIENCE: you need to convince the project head for the validation of the panguil bay bridge (PBB) project. SITUATION: the challange is that you are requested by the project head to approximate the number of bags of cement needed for a 1-meter length of the bridge and to answer the questions that follow. PRODUCT/PERFORMANCE AND PURPOSE:  you need to present your computation to the project head for validation. STANDARDS OF SUCCESS: student shows accuracy in computation-correctly converts measurement from one unit to anothwr with proper label, and no calculation errors. work is Well-organized that clearly shows thinking. COMPUTATION/CALCULATION:QUESTIONS:1.Insert your solution Are there exact measurements? 2.How do engineers measure the amount of materials needed for building construction? 3.What do you think will happen if engineers are not able to get close approximate of the amount of material for building construction?NEED TODAY​</a>

You will present your computation to the project head the project head for validation. Insert your solutionAre there exact measurements?How do engineers measure the amount of materials needed for building construction? What do you think will happen if engineers are not able to get close approximate of the amount of material for building construction?​</h2><br />

Teaching first graders how to play rugby, for example, is not the best idea. Also, consider whether the activity is appropriate for the students' ability. Powerlifting, for example, is extreme for a middle school student, but even swimming may not be acceptable for a high school student who does not know how to swim. As a result, such demands must be handled on a broad scale as well as on a student-by-student basis.</p><p></p><p>The next step is to be completely honest with yourself about your abilities and knowledge. Do you have the ability to teach the topic while also supervising and teaching it in a safe manner? Perhaps you're an expert at teaching pupils how to play baseball, but you're not so good at teaching effective weightlifting skills. In the latter situation, taking a class in the areas where you aren't as knowledgeable will help you teach your students what they need to know more safely.</p><p>
