                                            The writing process has four distinct phases. The first is invention, which isaided by any number of techniques, including free-writing, mind-mapping andoutlining. In this first stage, it's important for a writer not to edit but to let ideas flowand to simply get them down on paper. After invention, comes the first draft—thestage where the ideas start to take shape. Many writers use a sentence outline atthis stage to see where they need to cut and where they need to add material. Thefirst draft is also where writers should develop a tentative thesis to guide thestructure of their essay. The next stage of the process is when both the second andthird drafts are done. Here, ideas and structure are refined, and the thesis is reviseduntil it becomes the unifying idea of the paper. Finally, comes the last stage, that ofediting. Writers should take care at this stage that all sentence structure andpunctuation is correct, and they should make corrections to documentation format asneeded. Writers often repeat these four phases more than once, or skip a phase andgo back to it, making the writing process more cyclical than linear.​</a>

In the case of item 2, upon inspection we can transform this into aquadratic trinomial by letting k = x2. The resulting trinomial could befactored using techniques with trinomial.Let k = x22x4 - 7x2 – 15 = 2k2 - 7k - 15= (+3)(-5)But since k = x2,2x4 - 7x2 – 15 = (_+3)(-_-5)(since we cannot factor it further so this serves as our finalanswer)​</a>

In this first stage, it's important for a writer not to edit but to let ideas flowand to simply get them down on paper. After invention, comes the first draft—thestage where the ideas start to take shape. Many writers use a sentence outline atthis stage to see where they need to cut and where they need to add material. Thefirst draft is also where writers should develop a tentative thesis to guide thestructure of their essay. The next stage of the process is when both the second andthird drafts are done. Here, ideas and structure are refined, and the thesis is reviseduntil it becomes the unifying idea of the paper. Finally, comes the last stage, that ofediting. Writers should take care at this stage that all sentence structure andpunctuation is correct, and they should make corrections to documentation format asneeded. Writers often repeat these four phases more than once, or skip a phase andgo back to it, making the writing process more cyclical than linear.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Topic :Beauty </p><p>The subjective element of beauty involves judgment, not opinion. Many people feel beauty is only something seen by the eyes. St. Thomas Aquinas views beauty in both the supernatural and natural orders. Aquinas lists the attributes of beauty to be found in nature. These are; unity, proportion, and clarity. We will see how these attributes of beauty are seen through the eye and felt by the heart. To begin, the concept of unity follows the Aristotelian proposition that nothing can be added to or taken away from a perfect work of art. Next, proportion, or the harmony of the parts to the whole and to each other is, based the mathematical and geometric relationships discovered by the Ancient Greeks. Beauty is something that can be interpreted completely different from person to person. A famous quote that goes along with this perfectly is “beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” I think a person’s inner beauty should be taken into account when deciding whether or not a person is beautiful.</p><p></p><br />

They make a magical bridge over the river. Halfway across the bridge, they meet the personification of Death who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The eldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother doesn't trust Death and asks for a way to stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.</p><p></p><p>The eldest brother, bragging about his powerful wand, is robbed of it and murdered while he is asleep. The middle brother uses his ability to bring back the woman he loved, who died before he could marry her. However, she is not fully alive and is full of sorrow. He kills himself to join her. As for the youngest brother, Death never manages to find him, as he stays hidden under his Cloak. Many years later, the brother removes his cloak and gives it to his son. Pleased with his achievements, he greets Death as an old friend and chooses to leave with him as equals</p><p></p><p>Ayan napo </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa Brainliest po ty </p><br />
