                                            PRINCIPLES OF ART The principles of design are mechanisms of arrangement and organization for the various elements of design in artwork. Please note that different sources might list slightly different versions of the Principles of Design." but the core fundamentals are essentially the same. Harmony in art and design is the visually satisfying effect of combining similar related elements. For instance: adjacent colors on the color wheel, similar shapes etc. 2. Balance is a feeling of equality in weight, attention, or attraction of the various visual elements within the pictorial field as a means of accomplishing organic unity. 3. Proportion is the comparison of dimensions or distribution of forms. It is the relationship in scale between one element and another, or between a whole object and one of its parts. Differing proportions within a composition can relate to different kinds of balance or symmetry, and can help establish visual weight and depth 4. Dominance/Emphasis- The principle of visual organization that suggests that certain elements should assume more importance than others in the same composition. It contributes to organic unity by emphasizing the fact that there is one main feature and that other elements are subordinate to it. In the below examples, notice how the smaller elements seem to recede into the background while the larger elements come to the front. Pay attention to both scale and value of the objects that recede and advance. 5. Variety is the complement to unity and harmony, and is needed to create visual interest. Without unity and harmony, an image is chaotic and "unreadable," without variety it is dull and uninteresting. Good design is achieved through the balance of​</a>

                            17. PRINCIPLES OF ART The principles of design are mechanisms of arrangement and organization for the various elements of design in artwork. Please note that different sources might list slightly different versions of the Principles of Design." but the core fundamentals are essentially the same. Harmony in art and design is the visually satisfying effect of combining similar related elements. For instance: adjacent colors on the color wheel, similar shapes etc. 2. Balance is a feeling of equality in weight, attention, or attraction of the various visual elements within the pictorial field as a means of accomplishing organic unity. 3. Proportion is the comparison of dimensions or distribution of forms. It is the relationship in scale between one element and another, or between a whole object and one of its parts. Differing proportions within a composition can relate to different kinds of balance or symmetry, and can help establish visual weight and depth 4. Dominance/Emphasis- The principle of visual organization that suggests that certain elements should assume more importance than others in the same composition. It contributes to organic unity by emphasizing the fact that there is one main feature and that other elements are subordinate to it. In the below examples, notice how the smaller elements seem to recede into the background while the larger elements come to the front. Pay attention to both scale and value of the objects that recede and advance. 5. Variety is the complement to unity and harmony, and is needed to create visual interest. Without unity and harmony, an image is chaotic and "unreadable," without variety it is dull and uninteresting. Good design is achieved through the balance of​</h2><br />
