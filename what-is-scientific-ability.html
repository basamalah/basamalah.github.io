"Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines" by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</a>

"Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines" by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</h2><br />

The objective/research question of this study is to investigate the relationship between reading comprehension skills and performance in science among high school students in the Philippines.</p><p>2.	Based on the conclusion, it appears that the objective/research question was not attained, as the study found that the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science among first-year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines was poor.</p><p>3.	Some of the research findings based on the conclusion are:</p><p>•	Students in the Philippines need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalized economy.</p><p>•	Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them.</p><p>•	The level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science among first-year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines is poor.</p><p>•	Students seem to be struggling with both the content of science and the skills needed to be a proficient reader.</p><p>•	There is a significant positive correlation between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, but such relationship is negligible.</p><p>•	Poor performance in science among Filipino students is contributing to the bad image of Philippine education both locally and abroad, and this can be explained by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.</p><p></p><br />
