Along the way, they had to cross a brook. The salt bag and the donkey both went into the water as the donkey tumbled down the creek one day. Because the salt dissolved in the water, the bag became extremely light to carry. The donkey was overjoyed.​</a>

                                            2. There once lived a salt merchant. He had a monkey for his assistance. Every morning, he would load a sack of salt on the donkey and go to the nearby town to sell it. On the way, they had to walk across a pond. One day, while crossing the pond, the donkey thought,"Ooh! This load is so heavy that I become exhausted very soon. I wish I could get some of this load taken off my back." Just then the donkey tripped and fell into the water. Fortunately, the donkey was not hurt. But the sack of salt on the donkey's back fell into the water. Both the donkey and the salt became wet. Some of the salt in the sack got dissolved, making the load on the donkey lighter. The donkey felt very happy about the reduction in the weight of the sack of salt on its back. The merchant did his best to help the donkey to get up and they carried on their journey. From that day, it became a regular practice for the donkey to slip and fall in the pond whenever they crossed the pond to the market. This would dissolve some salt in the sack thus reducing the weight and relieving the donkey of some load. The merchant was not aware of the donkey's cunningness. This continued for a few days. One day, the merchant noticed the donkey deliberately slipping and landing with the sack into the water. "Oh! So this is the way I am losing my salt everyday" he thought. He decided to teach the donkey a lesson. Next morning, instead of loading a sack of salt, the merchant loaded a sack of cotton on the donkey's back. As usual they had decided to reach the market by crossing the same pond. While crossing the same pond, the donkey, as usual, slipped and fell into the pond, hoping that after some time the weight of the sack would go reduced. As usual, both the donkey and the cotton would become wet. But this time, when he got up, the load on his back seemed heavier. "Ooh! The Load seems to have gotten heavier," thought the donkey. The donkey was astonished at what had taken place against the usual result. The merchant looked at the donkey and said, "Dear friend, I saw you fall into the water of the pond deliberately every day with the malicious intention of reducing the weight of the salt. So, I loaded a sack of cotton today. Cotton when wet gets more weight and becomes heavier. Now you will have to carry it to the town." The poor donkey had learnt his lesson. 1.characters2.setting3.point of view4.themePASAGOT PO PLS.​</a>

                                            ONLY 5 QUESTIONS BUT READ THE STORY FIRST BEFORE ANSWERINGSTORY #1 The Donkey and the Mule A Peddler set off on his usual journey. All of the things he would sell along the way were packed on his donkey and his mule. The donkey walked along easily until they started up the steep mountain path. The poor little donkey’s load was more than he could bear. He begged the mule to take a little bit of his load, so that he could carry the rest more easily. But the mule paid no attention. At last they reached the top of the mountain where there was a small inn. The donkey was so exhausted that he fell to the ground. The next morning the donkey still could not get to his feet. Not knowing what else to do, the Peddler added the donkey’s load to the mule’s load, and went on without the donkey. The mule’s load was heavy, but his heart was even heavier. “If only I had helped the donkey just a little, I would not have a double load myself,” he reflected. STORY #2 The Peddler’s Mule A Peddler took his mule to the seacoast to buy salt. On the way home, they crossed a shallow stream where the mule accidentally slipped and fell. All of the salt in the bags dissolved, and the mule’s load was much lighter. The Peddler went back and bought even more salt than before. When they came to the stream, the mule fell down on purpose. When he got up, his load was again much lighter than before. The Peddler saw through the mule’s trick, and went back to the seacoast a third time. This time, instead of salt, he bought a cargo of sponges. Again, the mule fell down when they reached the stream. The sponges filled with water, and greatly increased his load. This time he had only tricked himself. THE QUESTIONS1. A Peddler goes on a trip. A. “The Donkey and the Mule” onlyB. Both storiesC. “The Peddler’s Mule” onlyD. Neither story2.

                            8. What is the meaning behind the "Donkey Cart" story?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A teacher in a small town in the northwest of China named S.T Hwang decided to go back home because he can't endure the isolation. However, on the departure point most of the carts were engaged in carrying local products so S.T Hwang spent his time at the restaurant to eat and rest while waiting for the next cart. Time passed he was informed that an available cart had arrived. Hwang recognized the driver as Lin Ng, an old man with most unsavory reputation but he decided to take a risk. While in the journey Lin Ng told to S.T Hwang the truth about his unsavory rumors which made our main character realize that Lin Ng wasn't a bad person after all. He later believed him so he dropped the stone he brought before he took the ride until they reach the train station. Lin Ng requested to him to write his friends in town about Lin Ng and S.T Hwang assured of it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>base on my research</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This is not an animal story nor does it have something to do with a donkey. It just so happen most of the events happened while our characters were on a donkey cart, one of the common transports on rural areas in China.</p><p></p><p>Alright, so this is a summary on the short story Donkey Cart written by S.T. Hwang. The main character wasn't mentioned in the story so it is just assumed that he might be our main character, anyway the summary goes like this</p><br />

                            10. 2. There once lived a salt merchant. He had a monkey for his assistance. Every morning, he would load a sack of salt on the donkey and go to the nearby town to sell it. On the way, they had to walk across a pond. One day, while crossing the pond, the donkey thought,"Ooh! This load is so heavy that I become exhausted very soon. I wish I could get some of this load taken off my back." Just then the donkey tripped and fell into the water. Fortunately, the donkey was not hurt. But the sack of salt on the donkey's back fell into the water. Both the donkey and the salt became wet. Some of the salt in the sack got dissolved, making the load on the donkey lighter. The donkey felt very happy about the reduction in the weight of the sack of salt on its back. The merchant did his best to help the donkey to get up and they carried on their journey. From that day, it became a regular practice for the donkey to slip and fall in the pond whenever they crossed the pond to the market. This would dissolve some salt in the sack thus reducing the weight and relieving the donkey of some load. The merchant was not aware of the donkey's cunningness. This continued for a few days. One day, the merchant noticed the donkey deliberately slipping and landing with the sack into the water. "Oh! So this is the way I am losing my salt everyday" he thought. He decided to teach the donkey a lesson. Next morning, instead of loading a sack of salt, the merchant loaded a sack of cotton on the donkey's back. As usual they had decided to reach the market by crossing the same pond. While crossing the same pond, the donkey, as usual, slipped and fell into the pond, hoping that after some time the weight of the sack would go reduced. As usual, both the donkey and the cotton would become wet. But this time, when he got up, the load on his back seemed heavier. "Ooh! The Load seems to have gotten heavier," thought the donkey. The donkey was astonished at what had taken place against the usual result. The merchant looked at the donkey and said, "Dear friend, I saw you fall into the water of the pond deliberately every day with the malicious intention of reducing the weight of the salt. So, I loaded a sack of cotton today. Cotton when wet gets more weight and becomes heavier. Now you will have to carry it to the town." The poor donkey had learnt his lesson. 1.characters2.setting3.point of view4.themePASAGOT PO PLS.​</h2><br />

                            20. ONLY 5 QUESTIONS BUT READ THE STORY FIRST BEFORE ANSWERINGSTORY #1 The Donkey and the Mule A Peddler set off on his usual journey. All of the things he would sell along the way were packed on his donkey and his mule. The donkey walked along easily until they started up the steep mountain path. The poor little donkey’s load was more than he could bear. He begged the mule to take a little bit of his load, so that he could carry the rest more easily. But the mule paid no attention. At last they reached the top of the mountain where there was a small inn. The donkey was so exhausted that he fell to the ground. The next morning the donkey still could not get to his feet. Not knowing what else to do, the Peddler added the donkey’s load to the mule’s load, and went on without the donkey. The mule’s load was heavy, but his heart was even heavier. “If only I had helped the donkey just a little, I would not have a double load myself,” he reflected. STORY #2 The Peddler’s Mule A Peddler took his mule to the seacoast to buy salt. On the way home, they crossed a shallow stream where the mule accidentally slipped and fell. All of the salt in the bags dissolved, and the mule’s load was much lighter. The Peddler went back and bought even more salt than before. When they came to the stream, the mule fell down on purpose. When he got up, his load was again much lighter than before. The Peddler saw through the mule’s trick, and went back to the seacoast a third time. This time, instead of salt, he bought a cargo of sponges. Again, the mule fell down when they reached the stream. The sponges filled with water, and greatly increased his load. This time he had only tricked himself. THE QUESTIONS1. A Peddler goes on a trip. A. “The Donkey and the Mule” onlyB. Both storiesC. “The Peddler’s Mule” onlyD. Neither story2.

The donkey carrying the salt staggered under the weight of his burden, and fell into the water, but the water dissolved the salt so he soon got up again and went on his way feeling much better.</p><p></p><p>  When the donkey carrying sponges saw how much more cheerful his companion appeared to be for the fall, he decided to follow his example, and he lay down in the river. But the water which had dissolved the salt sank into the sponges and made them forty times heavier, and the poor donkey drowned under the weight.</p><br />
