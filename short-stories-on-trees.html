"It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves." "Thus ungratefully, O God, do men receive their blessings!" Two travelers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a wide spreading tree to rest. "Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless!" As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane tree. Moral: Our best blessings are often the least appreciated. 7​</a>

</p><p>
</p>The plant propagation used in the story is the so -called seed propagation or planting using the seed or seeds of the plant. In the story, they planted healthy jackfruit seeds in the ground and after three weeks, the seeds germinated and became a seedling. The seedlings are now planted in a shaded area so that they can grow more and become many trees one day.  One of the most common or popular propagation is seed propagation. Next up is the cutting. This method involves cutting the stems of a plant and then planting them in the ground to have roots.

Why?10. Setting the life of Ephemera as an example, what would you tell the tree about happiness if you can talk to it? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Character trait of Ephemera helped itself to enjoy life by:</p><p></p><p>—Be Humble. The highest form of humility is the acceptance of our limitations – even if acknowledging our limitless potential – while unflinchingly recognizing the truth of humanity’s interdependence and our reliance on something or someone higher than us.</p><p>—Be Courageous. At exactly that point where courage falters, is the point at which all other character traits fail as well. In other words, courage is needed to nail every other character trait to the wall of integrity. Loving the loveable is easy. But loving the unlovable takes courage. Be Grateful. </p><p>—Be Tolerant. The truly happy are a tolerant bunch. They are tolerant of others’ mistakes. They are appropriately tolerant of their own. They tolerate the uncertainty of life. They don’t feel the need to control it or to control others.Be Loving. </p><p>—Be Forgiving. Forgiveness at its highest form is forgiveness broadly applied, as an expression of a forgiving heart. It is the attitude of forgiveness. It manifests itself even as the offense is taking place. It is spontaneous forgiveness. It’s the attitude of Gandhi to his jailors, and Jesus to his crucifiers.  And it is a character trait of the very deeply happy.</p><p>—Be Selfless. Selfishness is the great destroyer of love and compassion, of kindness, empathy and happiness. The problem is that it is also quite a natural part of the human condition.</p><p>—Be Honest. Be true to others. If you say you’ll do a thing, do it. If you’re not sure you’ll get to it, don’t say it. This builds credibility. Others will come to trust and respect you when they are confident your word is a stronger adhesive to action than a law suit is a disincentive to being dishonest. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>For number 8 Lang po yan, I hope makatulong</p><br />

does not have fruit or nuts that we can eat, and we cannot even use its wood for anything.”
“Don’t be so ungrateful,” rustled the tree in reply. “I am being extremely useful to

                            20. Watch the short animated film, "The Lorax" and answer the following questions in 
DESCRIPTIVE PHRASES or SHORT SENTENCES based on the factual information and your interpretation.1. What was discovered by the Once-ler at the "beautiful place" at the start of the story? What did the Once-ler do when he arrived at the "beautiful place"? Using the tufts from the Truffula Trees, what did the Once-ler create? Identify each. What cautions did the Once-ler get from the Lorax?2. Why did the Once-ler disregard the Lorax's advice? Why did the Once-ler value the truffula trees?
 How was the forest destroyed? How did the removal of the trees damage the wildlife and the forest? 
The Bar-B-Loots, what happened to them? Swomee-Swans? Humming-Fish? How was the forest 
impacted by the factory? why did The Once-ler was warned by the Lorax about the consequences of 
his greed and factory? Why did the Once-ler change his perspective by the end of the story?3. What happened to the “glorious place” as time passed? Classify the direct and indirect effects of the 
loss of the Truffula Trees. Compare and contrast the forest before and after the Once-ler. What caused 
the Lorax to “cough, whiff, sneeze, and croak”? Why did the Once-ler give the child a seed at the end of the story? After the child receives the seed, predict what happens next in the story. What did the 
seed at the end of the story signify? The Lorax spoke on behalf of what in the story?4. What is the Environmental message behind THE LORAX?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The Once-ler discovered a "beautiful place" full of Truffula Trees when he arrived at the start of the story. When he arrived, he proceeded to use the tufts from the Truffula Trees to create Thneeds, a multi-purpose product. The Lorax warned the Once-ler about the consequences of his actions and the environmental impact of his actions. </p><p></p><p>2. The Once-ler disregarded the Lorax's advice due to his greed and ambition to build a factory and make money. TheOnce-ler valued the truffula trees because he believed he could make money off them. The forest was destroyed due to the removal of the trees which lead to the displacement of the Bar-B-Loots, the Swomee-Swans, and the Humming-Fish. The forest was impacted by the factory because it emitted smoke and pollution. The Once-ler was warned by the Lorax about pollution, deforestation, and displacement of the animals. The Once-ler finally changed his perspective by the end of the story, realizing the negative impact of his actions on the environment and the animals. </p><p></p><p>3. As time passed, the "glorious place" was contaminated and polluted, due to the air and water being polluted and the land being over-cut and destroyed. The direct effect of the loss of the Truffula Trees was the displacement of animals, air and water pollution, deforestation, lack of resources, and smoggy air. The indirect effect was an altered environment and a decrease of biodiversity. The cause of the Lorax coughing, whiffing, sneezing, and croaking was due to the pollution of the environment from smoke from the factory. The Once-ler gave the child a seed at the end of the story to symbolize optimism and hope as the seed became of symbol to start a new forest. After the child receives the seed, it is likely that the child replants the seed, growing a new forest, restoring the environment and bringing back the same species of animals. The seed at the end of the story signifies new possibilities and optimism. The Lorax spoke on behalf of nature and the environment, criticizing the short-term thinking of the Once-ler. </p><p></p><p>4. The environmental message behind THE LORAX is that humankind needs to be conscious of their actions and how it can affect the environment because maintaining balance between humans and the natural environment is essential for life on Earth. By disregarding environmental regulations and being selfish about business, industries can cause longterm pollution and displacement of animals, leading to permanent damage. It is important to be responsible for our actions and take action to stop bad practices.</p><br />
