                                            Homer's Odyssey (Plot Synopsis)
Source: http://www.sparknotes.com/livodyssey/summary.html
Ten years have passed since the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not retumed to his
kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have overrun Odysseus's palace and pillaged his
land continue to court his wife, Penelope. She has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince Telemachus
Odysseus's son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight
them. One of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince, eliminating the only opposition to
their dominion over the palace.
HI
Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph Calypso, possessed by love for him, has
imprisoned him on her island, Ogygia. Ho longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to
help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus debate Odysseus's future, Athena
Odysseus's strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend of the
prince's grandfather, Laertes, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he
reproaches the suitors. Athena also prepares him for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta, where the kings
Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus's companions during the war, inform him that Odysseus is alive and trapped
on Calypso's island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca, Antinous and the other
suitors prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.

                            6. pa summarize po thank youuuuFilipino Hospitality Keeping strangers warm the Filipino way In ancient Greece, Telemachus was a complete stranger who happened to pass by the house of Nestor and was warmly welcomed befitting a family member. The stranger's feet were washed by the host and he was offered food and wine. Nestor's son even slept on a bed close to Telemachus to see to it that no ham would befall the stranger. In the Greek custom, only after the guest had been feeling comfortable would be the time for the host to ask his name. It happened that Telemachus was the son of Deysseus. Although he had no knowledge that the stranger was the son of the legendary king of Ithaca, Nestor nonetheless gave Telemachus equal treatment as if the stranger was part of the family. From the story was derived the modern meaning of hospitality to refer to the warm reception accorded by a host to a guest may he be a stranger or a known friend. This hospitality captures the Filipino tradition of receiving The status in life of the stranger does not matter to the Fipino host because the act of generosity is something inborn in them as a people. The Filipino hospitality would even go as far as guiding the stranger to his next voyage or travel itinerary, in the same way that Nestor provided Telemachus a horse so that he can reach soonest, while Nestor's own son Pisistratus drove for pinus would even provide protection and guidance for the ly if he is new to the area.

                            16. Question 1
What can we say about the gods in The Odyssey?
They know more than humans, but they are not perfect.
They sometimes drive the plot by giving the characters information.
They often disagree with one another on what ought to happen to Odysseus.
All of the above.
Question 2
Which is true of Penelope in the story?
She is a weak character, subject to forces of various kinds.
She manipulates her suitors.
She has no voice, which reflects the patriarchal mentality of The Odyssey.
She looks for an opportunity to betray Odysseus as soon as he fails to return quickly from the Trojan War.
Question 3
What is true about Odysseus’ interactions with Calypso?
The gods do not intervene in Calypso’s plans for Odysseus.
Odysseus refuses to have sexual relations with Calypso out of loyalty to his wife Penelope.
Odysseus shows great skills of diplomacy in his dealing with the Calypso.
When Odysseus departs the island, Calypso is so angry that she refuses to give him goods to help him on his voyage.
Question 4
Which of the following is FALSE about the way that the The Odyssey treats the ethics of its characters and settings?
It is largely an ethics of survival.
As a character, Odysseus develops morally as the story progresses and returns to Ithaca much more subdued and respectful than when he left.
It can be understood as an allegory for the difficulties of maintaining a city-state in a politically turbulent world.
It positions listeners and readers in between Greek peoples and other civilizations.
Question 5
What CANNOT be inferred from the beginning of The Odyssey?
It will inevitably conclude with a great battle between different factions of gods.
It is primarily about the travails of a single man, Odysseus.
Odysseus is a man of many turns of phrase, i.e., a man who knows how to manipulate language.
The Odyssey is a travel tale.
Question 6
Which of the following is NOT a cultural innovation that undergirded the soft power Alexander the Great commanded?
The Greeks made the alphabet easy to use for writing.
Libraries were established in places under Alexander’s rule.
The invention of Pergamentum, or parchment.
The invention of papyrus.
Question 7
Which of the following is true about Greek drama?
It is an art form that first developed in Alexander’s time.
The use of an elaborately written play to be performed in large open-air theatres was one of the central inventions of Greek culture.
Alexander hated Greek drama, and attempted to shut down all performances.
Because drama was only written in Greek, it did not catch on for other cultures and linguistic groups.
Question 8
Which of the following is true about Alexander’s export of libraries?
The library of Alexandria was the second-most important library in Alexander’s time.
The library of Alexandria was established in the wake of Alexander’s conquest of India.
The library of Pergamon was the most important library of Alexander’s time.
It was in the libraries that scribes copied and interpreted great Greek texts and used them for educational purposes.
Question 10

                            18. Homer's Odyssey (Plot Synopsis)
Source: http://www.sparknotes.com/livodyssey/summary.html
Ten years have passed since the fall of Troy, and the Greek hero Odysseus still has not retumed to his
kingdom in Ithaca. A large and rowdy mob of suitors who have overrun Odysseus's palace and pillaged his
land continue to court his wife, Penelope. She has remained faithful to Odysseus. Prince Telemachus
Odysseus's son, wants desperately to throw them out but does not have the confidence or experience to fight
them. One of the suitors, Antinous, plans to assassinate the young prince, eliminating the only opposition to
their dominion over the palace.
HI
Unknown to the suitors, Odysseus is still alive. The beautiful nymph Calypso, possessed by love for him, has
imprisoned him on her island, Ogygia. Ho longs to return to his wife and son, but he has no ship or crew to
help him escape. While the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus debate Odysseus's future, Athena
Odysseus's strongest supporter among the gods, resolves to help Telemachus. Disguised as a friend of the
prince's grandfather, Laertes, she convinces the prince to call a meeting of the assembly at which he
reproaches the suitors. Athena also prepares him for a great journey to Pylos and Sparta, where the kings
Nestor and Menelaus, Odysseus's companions during the war, inform him that Odysseus is alive and trapped
on Calypso's island. Telemachus makes plans to return home, while, back in Ithaca, Antinous and the other
suitors prepare an ambush to kill him when he reaches port.

They know more than humans, but they are not perfect.
They sometimes drive the plot by giving the characters information.

All of the above.
Question 2
Which is true of Penelope in the story?
She is a weak character, subject to forces of various kinds.
She manipulates her suitors.
She has no voice, which reflects the patriarchal mentality of The Odyssey.

Odysseus shows great skills of diplomacy in his dealing with the Calypso.
When Odysseus departs the island, Calypso is so angry that she refuses to give him goods to help him on his voyage.
Question 4
Which of the following is FALSE about the way that the The Odyssey treats the ethics of its characters and settings?
It is largely an ethics of survival.
As a character, Odysseus develops morally as the story progresses and returns to Ithaca much more subdued and respectful than when he left.
It can be understood as an allegory for the difficulties of maintaining a city-state in a politically turbulent world.
It positions listeners and readers in between Greek peoples and other civilizations.
Question 5
What CANNOT be inferred from the beginning of The Odyssey?
It will inevitably conclude with a great battle between different factions of gods.
