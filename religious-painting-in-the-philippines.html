(Remove the word "not")<p></p><p><strong>Other Information:</strong></p><p></p><p>Baroque architecture is a highly colorful and theatrical style that originated in Italy in the early 17th century and extended across Europe over time. It was first used by the Catholic Church, particularly the Jesuits, to combat the Protestant Reformation with a new architecture that inspired surprise and awe. It peaked during the High Baroque (1625–1675), when it was used in churches and palaces throughout Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Bavaria, and Austria. It spread as far as Russia and the Spanish and Portuguese possessions in Latin America during the Late Baroque period (1675–1750). Beginning around 1730, a more ornately decorated form known as Rococo arose and flourished in Central Europe. </p><p></p><p>The essential components of Renaissance architecture, such as domes and colonnades, were elevated, bigger, more ornate, and more dramatic by Baroque architects. Quadratura, or trompe-l'il painting coupled with sculpture, was frequently used to create interior effects; the eye is drawn upward, giving the appearance of looking into the heavens. The roof is crammed with sculpted angels and painted figures. Light streamed down from Cupolas and was reflected off an abundance of gilding to create a spectacular appearance. Cartouches and other decorative features dominated every available space, and twisted columns were frequently utilized to give the sense of upward motion. Grand stairways became a central feature in Baroque palaces.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />
