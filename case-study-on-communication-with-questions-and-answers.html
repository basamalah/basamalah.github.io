Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</a>

[Just Saying] The West Philippine Sea must be saved April 19, 2021 4:04 PM PHT 'China's communist officials may have thoroughly studied President Duterte's psyche and concluded that he cannot talk tough against China in the same way he talks tough against his own people! international tribunal. President Aquino's administration filed a case before the Hague international tribunal, resulting in a victory for the Philippines. The landmark decision was halled all over the world. The West Philippine Sea is again center stage in addition to COVID-19. In international law, there are four stages in case of international conflict - short of war - which the Philippines must undertake. Third, upon receipt of the decision, the Philippines must openly urge the losing country to abide immediately and strictly by the decision, with an admonition that noncompliance will result in further international recourse. President Duterte failed to do this upon official receipt of the West Philippine Sea ruling by his administration in the early part of its term. First, the Philippines should alert the world of the impending trouble. This is what is called "noisy," but not belligerent, diplomacy. President Aquino did that after exhausting to solve the problem through "silent" diplomacy. As head of state, he openly called China "a bully." He criticized China's intrusion, publicly declaring that China's movements in the South China Sea were comparable to Nazi Germany's expansionist agenda before World War 2. By his pronouncements, President Aquino warned the international community that the issues are not only a localized problem, but an international concern. He did the right move. China's garrisons and missiles strategically positioned in the South China Sea must be met by, at the very least, the Philippines' overt act manifesting the preparedness to invoke and operationalize the VFA and the MDT. China's awareness of a definitive retaliatory response from the US pursuant to the latter's VFA and MDT commitments in case of an attack on the Philippines can be an effective deterrent.

[Just Saying] The West Philippine Sea must be saved April 19, 2021 4:04 PM PHT China's communist officials may have thoroughly studied President Duterte's psyche and concluded that he cannot talk tough against China in the same way he talks tough against his international tribunal. President Aquino's administration filed a case before the Hague international tribunal, resulting in a victory for the Philippines. The landmark decision was hailed all over the own people. world. The West Philippine Sea is again center stage in addition to COVID-19. In international law, there are four stages in case of international conflict - short of war - which the Philippines must Third, upon receipt of the decision, the Philippines must openly urge the losing country to abide immediately and strictly by the decision, with an admonition that noncompliance will result in further international recourse. President Duterte failed to do this upon official receipt of the West Philippine Sea ruling by his administration in the early part of its term. undertake. First, the Philippines should alert the world of the impending trouble. This is what is called "noisy," but not belligerent, diplomacy. President Aquino did that after exhausting to solve the problem through "silent" diplomacy. As head of state, he openly called Ching "a bully." He criticized China's intrusion, publicly declaring that Chino's movements in the South China Sea were comparable to Nazi Germany's expansionist agenda before World War 2. By his pronouncements, President Aquino warned the international community that the issues are not only a localized problem, but an international concern. He did the right move. China's garrisons and missiles strategically positioned in the South China Sea must be met by, at the very least, the Philippines' overt act manifesting the preparedness to invoke and operationalize the VFA and the MDT. China's awareness of a definitive retaliatory response from the US pursuant to the latter's VFA and MDT commitments in case of an attack on the Philippines can be an effective deterrent. The Philippines is in a serious mess. If not corrected, it will worsen, leaving an ugly legacy of President Duterte's leadership or, to be more precise, lack of it, in the West Philippine Sea - a facticity second only to Japan's Second World War Philippine occupation.

The attention of the WHO and the scientific community has been drawn by the discovery of a mutation of Severs Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus-2 in a small sample of COVID-19 cases in Quezon City last month SAS COV-2 is the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019. Scientists have pointed out that it's not unusual forvinuses to mutate. The small sample also does not represent the situation in the entire country. What bears watching however, is the potential of the mutant be more virulent than the original. There are fears that this could be the case in the SARS-CoV-2 mutation detected in Quezon City. Seeing COVID-19 becoming even more infectious and debilitating or lethal is the last thing the courty needs. While studies have not yet established the virulence of the mutated SARS-Cov-2h dicovery oddi urgency to the effort to ramp up the country's COVID testing and contact tracing capabilities The testing suffers not only from the limited number of kits and the high cost of the more rel test, but also the long wait for the results. Some people who undergo the swab test on suspicion that the might be infected still continue with their routines, mingling with people in the workplace in supermate and public transportation. By the time the results are known in three to five days, how many more people would have been infected? It's not enough to undergo the so-called gold standard in SARS-CoV-2 detection, the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. The result of the RT-PCR test must be known as quickly as possible, to prevent further virus transmission. This becomes more critical if the SARS-CoV-2 proves to be more virulent. Contact tracing, while significantly improved since the start of the pandemic, still needs a major boos The fears over the mutant SARS-CoV-2 variant might prove to be unfounded, but in this pandemic. it's alwa better to prepare for the worst.

                                            Case Study: For Critical Analysis
 Mr. A B. C was brought to court for stealing. The court noted that he has been convicted for similar offenses many times. Can the court put him in prison at this time and with a much heavier penalty?
 Mr. A's defense lawyer argued on A's behalf that A should be spared from prison for he is a Kleptomania-defined as a strong compulsion to steal. Why do you think this qualification is relevant to the case?
 - In law, cases like this, e.g. Kleptomania, has its own appropriate sentence.
- In psychology, kleptomania is tantamount to mental illness and needs treatment.
- In philosophy, underlying question-human freedom and responsibility-need to be examined.
From the philosophical point of view, the case presented earlier takes on different path. Its method of inquiry is holistic and considers many perspective or theories on its approach in solving or assessing problems in society or activities of life. Precisely in real-life situations, one perspective is not enough to show the strength of our decision. Philosophy is about life, and it is for this reason that philosophy is considered a holistic discipline.
Going back to the example, the story of Mr. A B. C is classic example where seemingly there is a conflict between law and reason. As mandated by law, stealing is punishable by law. The saying says : “Dura lex, sed lex – the law is stiff, but it is the law.” The law may seem to be harsh, but it is the law. We live in a community of laws and not of men.
 However, the other context of positive laws that need to be stressed is not the punitive aspect of the law but the rehabilitative attribute. The consideration of mitigating circumstances are situations that need to be examined. Logic demands that no individual can be punished for acts that he has no control of. Thus in the case of Mr. A B. C, kleptomania and other similar acts, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, are mitigating circumstances that lessen responsibility and accountability, but they cannot remove one’s responsibility and accountability. Thus, individuals are still accountable in all their actions.
Based on the case study presented about the case of Mr. A B. C, answer these two fundamental questions:
1. If you were the judge, can you sentence Mr. A. B. C to prison at this time and with heavier penalty?
2. Can a person be accountable for his acts if these are beyond his control?</a>

During his first year at one of the prestigious University in Mandaluyong, Juan decided to join a fraternity. While he was pledging, he started drinking, using prescription drugs and having sexual intercourse with some members of the fraternity. An older member of the fraternity introduced him to smoking and using drugs, he was deep into addiction. 
Imagine that you are one of a close friend to Juan.

It has three branches, two in Metro Manila and one in Laguna. The company has a total of 150 staffs from the administrative department to the operations team. Mr. See, the owner of the company, is well-loved by all his employees for being kind and caring. He made sure that every year his employees will have at least 5% increase in salary depending on their performance. On Christmas, he would give cash bonus and groceries worth 1,000 pesos to all his employees. He would also grant educational assistance to employees who would either pursue their education or for their children.It was a thriving business and everyone was happy. However, on the 15th day of March, the government announced the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in Metro Manila and its neighboring regions. In an attempt of the government to contain the pandemic, the government suspended various busines operations and implemented strict community quarantine procedure. To protect his employees, he suspended the operations of the restaurant and promised to continue to pay their salary in full and give them an amount of 5,000 pesos cash assistance for the rest of the ECQ period.With no income flowing in to the company, his accountant told him that the company might not survive if they continue to provide full salary and cash assistance to all employees. Despite offering food deliveries, the revenue is still not enough to pay the expenses. With no assurance when the pandemic coming to end, he offered several options to Mr. See:a. Lay-off half of the employees in all branches.b. Close down one branch in Metro Manila and Laguna.c. Suspend providing full salary and cash assistance to employeesQuestions:1.

                            4. pleshActivity 1: Let's Identify!Directions: Read and analyze the texts that you are about to read. Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult.

[Just Saying] The West Philippine Sea must be saved April 19, 2021 4:04 PM PHT 'China's communist officials may have thoroughly studied President Duterte's psyche and concluded that he cannot talk tough against China in the same way he talks tough against his own people! international tribunal. President Aquino's administration filed a case before the Hague international tribunal, resulting in a victory for the Philippines. The landmark decision was halled all over the world. The West Philippine Sea is again center stage in addition to COVID-19. In international law, there are four stages in case of international conflict - short of war - which the Philippines must undertake. Third, upon receipt of the decision, the Philippines must openly urge the losing country to abide immediately and strictly by the decision, with an admonition that noncompliance will result in further international recourse. President Duterte failed to do this upon official receipt of the West Philippine Sea ruling by his administration in the early part of its term. First, the Philippines should alert the world of the impending trouble. This is what is called "noisy," but not belligerent, diplomacy. President Aquino did that after exhausting to solve the problem through "silent" diplomacy. As head of state, he openly called China "a bully." He criticized China's intrusion, publicly declaring that China's movements in the South China Sea were comparable to Nazi Germany's expansionist agenda before World War 2. By his pronouncements, President Aquino warned the international community that the issues are not only a localized problem, but an international concern. He did the right move. China's garrisons and missiles strategically positioned in the South China Sea must be met by, at the very least, the Philippines' overt act manifesting the preparedness to invoke and operationalize the VFA and the MDT. China's awareness of a definitive retaliatory response from the US pursuant to the latter's VFA and MDT commitments in case of an attack on the Philippines can be an effective deterrent. The Philippines is in a serious mess. If not corrected, it will worsen, leaving an ugly legacy of President Duterte's leadership or, to be more precise, lack of it, in the West Philippine Sea - a facticity second only to Japan's Second World War Philippine occupation.

President Duterte failed to do this upon official receipt of the West Philippine Sea ruling by his administration in the early part of its term. undertake. First, the Philippines should alert the world of the impending trouble. This is what is called "noisy," but not belligerent, diplomacy. President Aquino did that after exhausting to solve the problem through "silent" diplomacy. As head of state, he openly called Ching "a bully." He criticized China's intrusion, publicly declaring that Chino's movements in the South China Sea were comparable to Nazi Germany's expansionist agenda before World War 2. By his pronouncements, President Aquino warned the international community that the issues are not only a localized problem, but an international concern. He did the right move. China's garrisons and missiles strategically positioned in the South China Sea must be met by, at the very least, the Philippines' overt act manifesting the preparedness to invoke and operationalize the VFA and the MDT. China's awareness of a definitive retaliatory response from the US pursuant to the latter's VFA and MDT commitments in case of an attack on the Philippines can be an effective deterrent. The Philippines is in a serious mess. If not corrected, it will worsen, leaving an ugly legacy of President Duterte's leadership or, to be more precise, lack of it, in the West Philippine Sea - a facticity second only to Japan's Second World War Philippine occupation.

The attention of the WHO and the scientific community has been drawn by the discovery of a mutation of Severs Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus-2 in a small sample of COVID-19 cases in Quezon City last month SAS COV-2 is the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019. Scientists have pointed out that it's not unusual forvinuses to mutate. The small sample also does not represent the situation in the entire country. What bears watching however, is the potential of the mutant be more virulent than the original. There are fears that this could be the case in the SARS-CoV-2 mutation detected in Quezon City. Seeing COVID-19 becoming even more infectious and debilitating or lethal is the last thing the courty needs. While studies have not yet established the virulence of the mutated SARS-Cov-2h dicovery oddi urgency to the effort to ramp up the country's COVID testing and contact tracing capabilities The testing suffers not only from the limited number of kits and the high cost of the more rel test, but also the long wait for the results. Some people who undergo the swab test on suspicion that the might be infected still continue with their routines, mingling with people in the workplace in supermate and public transportation. By the time the results are known in three to five days, how many more people would have been infected? It's not enough to undergo the so-called gold standard in SARS-CoV-2 detection, the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. The result of the RT-PCR test must be known as quickly as possible, to prevent further virus transmission. This becomes more critical if the SARS-CoV-2 proves to be more virulent. Contact tracing, while significantly improved since the start of the pandemic, still needs a major boos The fears over the mutant SARS-CoV-2 variant might prove to be unfounded, but in this pandemic. it's alwa better to prepare for the worst.

                            19. Case Study: For Critical Analysis
 Mr. A B. C was brought to court for stealing. The court noted that he has been convicted for similar offenses many times. Can the court put him in prison at this time and with a much heavier penalty?
 Mr. A's defense lawyer argued on A's behalf that A should be spared from prison for he is a Kleptomania-defined as a strong compulsion to steal. Why do you think this qualification is relevant to the case?
 - In law, cases like this, e.g. Kleptomania, has its own appropriate sentence.
- In psychology, kleptomania is tantamount to mental illness and needs treatment.
- In philosophy, underlying question-human freedom and responsibility-need to be examined.
From the philosophical point of view, the case presented earlier takes on different path. Its method of inquiry is holistic and considers many perspective or theories on its approach in solving or assessing problems in society or activities of life. Precisely in real-life situations, one perspective is not enough to show the strength of our decision. Philosophy is about life, and it is for this reason that philosophy is considered a holistic discipline.
Going back to the example, the story of Mr. A B. C is classic example where seemingly there is a conflict between law and reason. As mandated by law, stealing is punishable by law. The saying says : “Dura lex, sed lex – the law is stiff, but it is the law.” The law may seem to be harsh, but it is the law. We live in a community of laws and not of men.
 However, the other context of positive laws that need to be stressed is not the punitive aspect of the law but the rehabilitative attribute. The consideration of mitigating circumstances are situations that need to be examined. Logic demands that no individual can be punished for acts that he has no control of. Thus in the case of Mr. A B. C, kleptomania and other similar acts, if proven beyond reasonable doubt, are mitigating circumstances that lessen responsibility and accountability, but they cannot remove one’s responsibility and accountability. Thus, individuals are still accountable in all their actions.
Based on the case study presented about the case of Mr. A B. C, answer these two fundamental questions:
1. If you were the judge, can you sentence Mr. A. B. C to prison at this time and with heavier penalty?
2. Can a person be accountable for his acts if these are beyond his control?</h2><br />

</p><p></p><p>                -Kleptomania cannot be considered a legal defense to stealing – not even an insanity defense. Individuals are held responsible for their actions unless it can be clearly proven that they completely lack a sense self-control. The sentence is usually less time for a mental institution than a prison sentence.

It has three branches, two in Metro Manila and one in Laguna. The company has a total of 150 staffs from the administrative department to the operations team. Mr. See, the owner of the company, is well-loved by all his employees for being kind and caring. He made sure that every year his employees will have at least 5% increase in salary depending on their performance. On Christmas, he would give cash bonus and groceries worth 1,000 pesos to all his employees. He would also grant educational assistance to employees who would either pursue their education or for their children.It was a thriving business and everyone was happy. However, on the 15th day of March, the government announced the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) in Metro Manila and its neighboring regions. In an attempt of the government to contain the pandemic, the government suspended various busines operations and implemented strict community quarantine procedure. To protect his employees, he suspended the operations of the restaurant and promised to continue to pay their salary in full and give them an amount of 5,000 pesos cash assistance for the rest of the ECQ period.With no income flowing in to the company, his accountant told him that the company might not survive if they continue to provide full salary and cash assistance to all employees. Despite offering food deliveries, the revenue is still not enough to pay the expenses. With no assurance when the pandemic coming to end, he offered several options to Mr. See:a. Lay-off half of the employees in all branches.b. Close down one branch in Metro Manila and Laguna.c. Suspend providing full salary and cash assistance to employeesQuestions:1.
