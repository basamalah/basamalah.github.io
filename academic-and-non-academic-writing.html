                            24. Discuss the difference of Academic writing from non-academic writing.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>An academic, nonfiction text will be based on research methods that can be replicated. It will place the guiding question within an academic context (generally, this should be a disinterested endeavor to answer an academic question) and use peer-reviewed and respected sources to lead to a conclusion. The reader can follow the steps in the argument and decide if the evidence and the conclusions properly align with the question and the research method. The point is to advance human understanding in the discipline. Academic texts tend to use jargon, which serves as a shortcut for other academics already well-versed in prior studies and concepts in the area. This can make these texts more challenging for novice readers but serves the academic community by eschewing explanations not needed by the target audience. (This would be the equivalent of a sports writer not explaining what RBI or MVP stand for when discussing baseball.)</p><p></p><p>A non-academic text will bring the reading level down considerably so that a reader without much experience in the subject can learn basic information. Digitally, hyperlinks may now direct readers to definitions or other studies used to buttress the current text. Often, these pieces are summaries rather than original research, so the methods used to derive conclusions will be harder to detect. These texts will progress more as an argument based on claims and evidence but without any signposts for a reader to validate data. They can be reliable sources of basic information if a good editor verifies the piece, but with internet sources, it can be far too easy to post unreliable information that has not been properly reviewed. Because the method of study is not as easy to verify, non-academic sources are also more likely to involve persuasion rather than argument, or to present spurious research studies without acknowledging legitimate counter-arguments.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
