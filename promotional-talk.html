Have you heard of someone saying that you possess an acidic tongue? John Wayne, a famous American actor and film icon once said, “Talk low, talk slow, and don’t say too much.’ The Bible says, “a soft answer turns away wrath,” We can defuse heated situations by reining in our words. Responding gently and carefully to angry people can promote unity. Bite your tongue before your tongue bites others. Explain briefly what this statement means.</a>
