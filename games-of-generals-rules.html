                                            Create a program that lets the user play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The program should work as follows.
1. When the program begins, a random number in the range of 1 through 3 is generated. If the number is 1, then the computer has chosen rock. If the number is 2, then the computer has chosen paper. If the number is 3, then the computer has chosen scissors. (Don’t display the computer’s choice yet.)
2. The user enters his or her choice of “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors” at the keyboard. (You can use a menu if you prefer.)
3. The computer’s choice is displayed.
4. A winner is selected according to the following rules:
a. If one player chooses rock and the other player chooses scissors, then rock wins. (The rock smashes the scissors.)
b. If one player chooses scissors and the other player chooses paper, then scissor wins. (Scissors cuts paper.)
c. If one player chooses paper and the other player chooses rock, then paper wins. (Paper wraps rock.)
d. If both players make the same choice, the game must be played again to determine the winner.
Use the following function prototypes to perform each major task.
1. int random();
2. string input();
3. string compChoice(int);
4. void displayCompChoice(string);

                                            What I Have Learned Considering the previous readings on the qualities of an officiating official, cite a generalization by filling in the blank to complete the sentences: Basketball is played by two teams of five players each. The aim of each team is to throw the ball into the opponent's basket and prevent the other team from securing the ball or scoring. The officials in basketball are the (1) and (2), assisted by a time keeper, a scorer and a (3) is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. The officials in volleyball are consisting of two referees, four (5) and assisted by a (6) (7) is a system in sports that are used to maintain order and fairness in implementing sports rules. As a sport officiating official, you must be aware of what might happen during the game proper. It is important for an officiating official to possess the qualities holistically.

Write true if the statement is true and false if the stamen is incorrect.
1. Rebounds are credited to the second player that gains clear possession of the ball or to
the player that successfully deflects the ball into the basket for a score
2. Rebounds are divided into two main categories: "offensive rebounds", in which the ball is
recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and "defensive
rebounds",
3. Rebounding is one of the most important aspects of the basketball game which enables
the player to jump
4. Dribbling is easily the most important skill for any basketball player to master
5. Dribbling it is one way of not allowing the player to advance with the ball and make a
score instead of passing it to a teammate to shoot in the basket.
6. Rebounds are also given to a player who tips in a missed shot on his team's offensive
end
7. Ball handling, however, involves knowledge of the game and integrates dribbling, passing
and decision-making.
8. Dedicate a set amount of time each day to just handling the ball and working on your
dribbling and you’ll see progress in no time.
9. Dribbling allows the player to move around the basketball court while he or she is in the
possession of the ball
10.A team rebound is never credited to any player, and is generally considered to be a
formality as according to the rules of basketball,</a>
