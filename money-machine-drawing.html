</p><p>Hed by a "figure", an "order" and a "position" in the cosmos.[107] Atoms are, besides, creating the whole with the intrinsic movement in the vacuum, producing the diverse flux of being. Their movement is influenced by the parenklisis (Lucretius names it clinamen) and that is determined by chance. These ideas foreshadowed the understanding of traditional physics until the advent of 20th-century theories on the nature of atoms.[108][page needed]
</p><p>
</p><p>Plato
</p><p>Plato developed the distinction between true reality and illusion, in arguing that what is real are e sense of existence, copula, or identity); and argues, against Parmenides, that forms must exist not only of being, but also of Negation and of non-being (or Difference).[citation needed]
</p><p>
</p><p>Aristotle
</p><p>In his Categories, Aristotle (384–322 BCE) identifies ten possible kinds of things that may be the subject or the predicate of a proposition. For Aristotle there are four different ontological dimensions:[109]
</p><p>
</p><p>according to the various categories or ways of addressing a being as such
</p><p>according to its truth or falsity (e.g. fake gold, counterfeit money)
</p><p>whether it exists in and of itself or simply 'comes along' by accident
</p><p>according to its potency, movement (energy) or finished presence (Metaphysics Book Theta).
</p><p>Medieval
</p><p>Medieval ontology was strongly influenced by Aristotle's teachings. The thinkers of this period often relied on Aristotelian categories like substance, act and potency or matter and form to formulate their own theories. Important ontologists in this epoch include Avicenna, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus and William of Ockham.[110][111][112]
</p><p>
</p><p>Avicenna aka Ibn Sina
</p><p>According to Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina) (c. 980 – 1037), and in an interpretation of Greek Aristotelian and Platonist ontological doctrines in medieval metaphysics, being is either necessary, contingent qua possible, or impossible. Necessary being is that which cannot but be, since its non-being would entail a contradiction. Contingent qua possible being is neither necessary nor impossible for it to be or not to be. It is ontologically neutral, and is brought from potential existing into actual existence by way of a cause that is external to its essence. Its being is borrowed – unlike the necessary existent, which is self-subsisting and impossible not to be. As for the impossible
