Careful consideration of choices always yields positive consequences.
Every choice in life brings with it a wholly different set of consequences.
Humans should not reflect upon choices they may have already made.
Negative consequences can be avoided only if the right decision is made.</a>

Watch a special report from ABC News "White Supremacist Move Into Town", video is available in YouTube. This person's actions are consistent with his cultural belief that white people are superior. Would a cultural relativist be correct in maintaining that nobody has the moral basis to complain about the white supremacist's actions because he was just following what he believed was right?3. In the Philippines, one moral argument against RH Law is that it violates universal human rights and values such as the right to life and health of children. On the other hand, proponents of the law assert that family planning and sexual education consistent with one's own beliefs and moral convictions is exercising one's freedom to choose. If the basis of universal values is true and, taking into consideration our social problems due to overpopulation, what is your moral stand on the debate about having a comprehensive reproductive health program in the Philippines? ​</a>

Use a separate sheet for your answer.Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights,focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems.Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have theobligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. Human rights cannot be separated from the societalcontexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, whichinclude the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancingtheir ability to participate as active members of society. Such an understanding of social rights calls ourattention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the“collective.”We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic andits consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart,others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different socialidentities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, ourvulnerability to epidemics.Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rightsis not optional. In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respectand protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic andsocial rights for all.COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people acrossevery state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to theNew York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1]However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different socialidentities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have beendisproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their rightto health fulfilled.</a>

                                            Write a brief reflection/reaction about the paragraph below:"Our misfortunes are our own fault, let us blame nobody else for them. If Spain were to see us less tolerant of tyranny and readier to fight and suffer for our rights, Spain would be the first to give us freedom… But as long as the Filipino people do not have sufficient vigor to proclaim, head held high and chest bared, their right to a life of their own in human society, and to guarantee it with their sacrifices, with their very blood…why give them independence? With or without Spain they would be the same, and perhaps, perhaps worse. What is the use of independence if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow? And no doubt they will, because whoever submits to tyranny loves it!"     —Dr. Jose Rizal​</a>

                            9. Read Locke's quoted philosophy below. Write an essay about your reflection and its application to current society and / or government."The authority of a leader depends on the people he leads. It is the duty of the government to protect the human rights of their people. If the government fails to protect it, the people have the right to oust and replace their leader."</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Indeed, I believe that the destructive nature of society has to do with human intelligence. The inventions, doings, actions, and apathetic attitude of humans, destroys our planet. Humans impact the physical environment in many ways, like overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water. But also, human intelligence can overcome all of this through their efforts and inventions. People limiting the use of fossil fuels such as oil, carbon, and natural gas and replacing them with renewable and cleaner sources of energy, all while increasing energy efficiency. They also plant trees, do charities to help the environmental issues, and invent more. Therefore, human intelligence can both benefit us and destroy us, it just matters who'll outweigh who</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>(&gt; &lt;)</p><br />

                            11.

I can or I will give you all a 50 points for every answer even if it's right or not that right as long as it close to the topic...Brainliest ko n rin kayu)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The relationship between religion and morality has long been hotly debated. Does religion make us more moral? Is it necessary for morality? Do moral inclinations emerge independently of religious intuitions? These debates, which nowadays rumble on in scientific journals as well as in public life, have frequently been marred by a series of conceptual confusions and limitations. Many scientific investigations have failed to decompose “religion” and “morality” into theoretically grounded elements; have adopted parochial conceptions of key concepts—in particular, sanitized conceptions of “prosocial” behavior; and have neglected to consider the complex interplay between cognition and culture. We argue that to make progress, the categories “religion” and “morality” must be fractionated into a set of biologically and psychologically cogent traits, revealing the cognitive foundations that shape and constrain relevant cultural variants. We adopt this fractionating strategy, setting out an encompassing evolutionary framework within which to situate and evaluate relevant evidence. Our goals are twofold: to produce a detailed picture of the current state of the field, and to provide a road map for future research on the relationship between religion and morality.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Hope it helps :)</p><p></p><br />

                            13. Based on Robert Frost’s poem "The Road Not Taken,” which is the best theme statement about "consequences”?
Careful consideration of choices always yields positive consequences.
Every choice in life brings with it a wholly different set of consequences.
Humans should not reflect upon choices they may have already made.
Negative consequences can be avoided only if the right decision is made.</h2><br />

Watch a special report from ABC News "White Supremacist Move Into Town", video is available in YouTube. This person's actions are consistent with his cultural belief that white people are superior. Would a cultural relativist be correct in maintaining that nobody has the moral basis to complain about the white supremacist's actions because he was just following what he believed was right?3. In the Philippines, one moral argument against RH Law is that it violates universal human rights and values such as the right to life and health of children. On the other hand, proponents of the law assert that family planning and sexual education consistent with one's own beliefs and moral convictions is exercising one's freedom to choose. If the basis of universal values is true and, taking into consideration our social problems due to overpopulation, what is your moral stand on the debate about having a comprehensive reproductive health program in the Philippines? ​</h2><br />

It is shaped by social norms, cultural practices, and religious influences.Ethics tells us what to aspire to and also constrains our actions.Ethics reflect beliefs about what is right, what is wrong, what is just, what is unjust, what is good, and what is bad in terms of human behavior.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ethics is the process of questioning, discovering and defending our values, principles and purpose. It’s about finding out who we are and staying true to that in the face of temptations, challenges and uncertainty.

                            27. Write a paragraph about the cause-and-effects of COVID-19. Use the details below and write them in correct format. Use a separate sheet for your answer.Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights,focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems.Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have theobligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. Human rights cannot be separated from the societalcontexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled. Specifically, social rights, whichinclude the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancingtheir ability to participate as active members of society. Such an understanding of social rights calls ourattention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the“collective.”We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic andits consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart,others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different socialidentities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, ourvulnerability to epidemics.Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rightsis not optional. In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respectand protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic andsocial rights for all.COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people acrossevery state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to theNew York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1]However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different socialidentities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have beendisproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their rightto health fulfilled.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>    We investigate the relationship between media consumption, misinformation, and important attitudes and behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We find that comparatively more misinformation circulates on Twitter, while news media tends to reinforce public health recommendations like social distancing. We find that exposure to social media is associated with misperceptions regarding basic facts about COVID-19 while the inverse is true for news media. These misperceptions are in turn associated with lower compliance with social distancing measures. We thus draw a clear link from misinformation circulating on social media, notably Twitter, to behaviours and attitudes that potentially magnify the scale and lethality of COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kapag tama paki BRAINLIEST po</p><br />

If Spain were to see us less tolerant of tyranny and readier to fight and suffer for our rights, Spain would be the first to give us freedom… But as long as the Filipino people do not have sufficient vigor to proclaim, head held high and chest bared, their right to a life of their own in human society, and to guarantee it with their sacrifices, with their very blood…why give them independence? With or without Spain they would be the same, and perhaps, perhaps worse. What is the use of independence if the slaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow? And no doubt they will, because whoever submits to tyranny loves it!"     —Dr. Jose Rizal​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This paragraph expresses Dr. Jose Rizal's belief that the Filipino people need to take responsibility for their own misfortune and actively fight for their rights. He argues that unless they display courage and determination, they do not deserve independence from Spain. He also warns that without a change in mindset, the people will become tyrants themselves.
