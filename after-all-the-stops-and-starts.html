                                            You are recently promoted as the chief traffic management officer of a major city in the country. Based on recent data, you learned that one of the leading causes of road accidents is over speeding. In your desire to minimize road accidents, you went out to observe how traffic management rules are implemented on the streets. Your attention was caught by a fast - moving car that seemed to be breaking the speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour(km/hr.), and so you followed it along the highway. After a short time, the driver of the car noticed you and started to slow down. Eventually, he stopped on the side of the road. Supposed the speed of the car had been noted during this time and is modeled by the quadratic equation y = 3x² + 17x - 20, where y represents the speed of the car in km/hr. and x represents the number of minutes after you started following the car. How long did it take for the car to be under surveillance before it could finally stop on the side of the road? Did the driver of the car really break the speed limit of 100 km/hr.? Explain. The result of your observation will be presented to the students in your section and will be graded by your teacher. You will prepare an observation report highlighting whether it is necessary to come up with a more stringent implementation of traffic rules based on the outcome of your analysis of the problem that you encountered on the road. Your output will be evaluated based on the following standards: Thoroughness of analysis of the problem, Correctness of the solution of the problem, Completeness of the report, over all presentation.​</a>

                                            It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus- which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. (Donna Teressa M. Oropel) 1. What is the text all about? 2. What type of text is used? 3.

It all started right after school when I turned onto the busiest by the school. First, i pulled up right behind this truck at a stop sign. After a second, a fellow older student told me that I was close and that I was going to hit the truck in front of me. At the moment, I was trying to tell the kid that I was giving a ride to get back to the car because he was hanging out of the windows. Since I was distracted, I thought the long line of traffic had started to move, but it hadn't. In the blink of an eye, I hit the back of the truck in front of me. The devastation sunk. I was so worried that I damaged the truck, but all that I did was scratch his bumper. Lucky for him! Then, it came time to look at my car. My car was ruined. The hood was buckled up, the front end was pushed back, and my headlights were broken. Humiliated and scared, I still had to drive my totaled car home.

                            4. You are recently promoted as the chief traffic management officer of a major city in the country. Based on recent data, you learned that one of the leading causes of road accidents is over speeding. In your desire to minimize road accidents, you went out to observe how traffic management rules are implemented on the streets. Your attention was caught by a fast - moving car that seemed to be breaking the speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour(km/hr.), and so you followed it along the highway. After a short time, the driver of the car noticed you and started to slow down. Eventually, he stopped on the side of the road. Supposed the speed of the car had been noted during this time and is modeled by the quadratic equation y = 3x² + 17x - 20, where y represents the speed of the car in km/hr. and x represents the number of minutes after you started following the car. How long did it take for the car to be under surveillance before it could finally stop on the side of the road? Did the driver of the car really break the speed limit of 100 km/hr.? Explain. The result of your observation will be presented to the students in your section and will be graded by your teacher. You will prepare an observation report highlighting whether it is necessary to come up with a more stringent implementation of traffic rules based on the outcome of your analysis of the problem that you encountered on the road. Your output will be evaluated based on the following standards: Thoroughness of analysis of the problem, Correctness of the solution of the problem, Completeness of the report, over all presentation.​</h2><br />

                            9. It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus- which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. (Donna Teressa M. Oropel) 1. What is the text all about? 2. What type of text is used? 3.

How did you separate the impurities from the rice before cooking?</p><p>• In order to separate the impurities from the rice before cooking, water is added to the mixture and as we stir the mixture, the impurities in the middle or in the bottom slowly floated above the water surface.</p><p>3. What happened to the rice? Why?</p><p>• The rice remained in the bottom because it is denser than unwanted particles. </p><p>4. What happened to the impurities (husk etc)? Why?</p><p>• The impurities or unwanted particles such as the empty husks floated on the water because they are less denser than the rice grains.</p><p>5. Can the solid particles be separated from water right after mixing without letting it settle at the bottom of the bowl? Why?​</p><p>• Yes. The rice grains are denser than water and unwanted particles. As we poured out the water that contains impurities, the impurities flowed out with the water, thus, they were successfully separated from the rice grians before cooking.</p><p></p><p>Learn more about decantation:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/5632316</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><p></p><br />
