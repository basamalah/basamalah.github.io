                                            Overcoming Floods in the Philippines: A Story of Climate Change Adaptation and MitigationSta Rosa, Philippines is frequently visited with heavy rains that cause flash floods and severe flooding in the area and nearby cities. The city sits on the edge of Laguna Lake, the largest lake in the Philippines and located just east of its capital city – Manila.Professor Damasa Macandong of the University of the Philippines Institute of Biological Sciences says that climate change is causing stronger typhoons and rains to hit the Philippines. The video, “Overcoming Floods in the Philippines: A story of climate change adaptation and mitigation” presents that the rapid urbanization and industrialization contributed to the flooding problem.Agricultural lands have been paved with impermeable materials to accommodate factories, commercial buildings, and housing projects, and public infrastructures like roads, the video-documentary mentions.Japan’s Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) partnered with the University of the Philippines (UP) Los Baños to help Sta Rosa and neighboring towns to help adapt to increasing threats of flooding.The partnership between the two institutions has led to the Participatory Watershed Land Use Management Project.Through this partnership, the teams were able to combine their expertise to create flood hazard maps of the Sta Rosa watershed.According to Mr. Endo, these hazard maps will help cities understand the present and future threats of flooding.These hazard maps were able to simulate the condition of the watershed in 2025. Simulations show that massive flooding will affect the four cities comprising the watershed.This information allowed local officials to work together and come up with anintegrated approach to address flooding and implement adaptation strategies.Process Questions:1. What is the text all about?2. Who is the target audience of the given material?3. What do you think is the purpose of the material?4. How does the issue in the documentary affect you? How do you feel about it? ​</a>

The important metalle minerals found in various parts of the Philippines include gold, copper, iron chrome made up of chromium, iron, and other matalal nickel, cobalt, and platinum. The most productive copper and gold cars in the Philippines are found in Baguic, the province of Benguet, and in Surigao Davao areas Major producers of nickel are in Palawan and Surigao (DENR Webane 2012) Metals are important. The properties of metals make them useful for specific purposes You learned these in ter 1 fron is the main maternal for steel bars used in buildings and road construction Copper is used in making al wires Tin is the material for milk cana and other preserved food products. Nicket is mixed with copper or other secals to form stainless cooking wares Gold is important in making jewelry The Philippines has also varied nonmetallic resources including sand and gravel limestone, marble, clay and other quarry materials Your teacher will show you a map of the nometallic deposits in the Philippines Locate your are 1 and determine what nonmetallic deposits are found there How are these deposits recovered? How are they used in your community For example What are the uses of sand, gravel, or clay? How are marble stones used? Think of Do you know that the Philippines is listed as the 5th mineral country in the world, 3rd in gold reserves, 4th in cover and sth in nickel! The ores (mineral bearing rocka) are processed out of the country to recover the pure metal The richness of the Philippines in terms of mineral resources is being attributed to its location in the so called Pacific Ring of Fire. The area is associated with over 450 volcances (amall triangles in the map) and is home to approximately 75% of bron filings Quarte Copper ore EXERCISES A Identify the metallic deposits in the Philippines, their location and uses.

                            5. Overcoming Floods in the Philippines: A Story of Climate Change Adaptation and MitigationSta Rosa, Philippines is frequently visited with heavy rains that cause flash floods and severe flooding in the area and nearby cities. The city sits on the edge of Laguna Lake, the largest lake in the Philippines and located just east of its capital city – Manila.Professor Damasa Macandong of the University of the Philippines Institute of Biological Sciences says that climate change is causing stronger typhoons and rains to hit the Philippines. The video, “Overcoming Floods in the Philippines: A story of climate change adaptation and mitigation” presents that the rapid urbanization and industrialization contributed to the flooding problem.Agricultural lands have been paved with impermeable materials to accommodate factories, commercial buildings, and housing projects, and public infrastructures like roads, the video-documentary mentions.Japan’s Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) partnered with the University of the Philippines (UP) Los Baños to help Sta Rosa and neighboring towns to help adapt to increasing threats of flooding.The partnership between the two institutions has led to the Participatory Watershed Land Use Management Project.Through this partnership, the teams were able to combine their expertise to create flood hazard maps of the Sta Rosa watershed.According to Mr. Endo, these hazard maps will help cities understand the present and future threats of flooding.These hazard maps were able to simulate the condition of the watershed in 2025. Simulations show that massive flooding will affect the four cities comprising the watershed.This information allowed local officials to work together and come up with anintegrated approach to address flooding and implement adaptation strategies.Process Questions:1.
