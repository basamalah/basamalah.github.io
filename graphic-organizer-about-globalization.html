Do this in your notebookLand pollution is when humans introduce harmful objects, chemicals or substances,directly or indirectly into the soil in a way that causes harm to other living things or destroyssoil or water ecosystems. It can be caused due to agricultural sources, ashes, miningsources, industrial sources, sewage treatment, garbage or waste, constructions sources,deforestation, chemical and nuclear plants and oil refineries.When deforestation is committed, the tree cover is compromised on. This leads to asteep imbalance in the rain cycle. A disturbed rain cycle affects a lot of factors. To beginwith, the green cover is reduced. Trees and plants help balance the atmosphere, withoutthem we are subjected to various concerns like Global warming, the greenhouse effect,irregular rainfall and flash floods among other imbalances,Solution for land pollution is 1) Make people aware about the concept of Reduce,Recycle and Reuse. 2) Reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural activities. 3)Buy biodegradable products. 4) Do Organic gardening and eat organic food that will begrown without the use of pesticides. 5) Plant a greater number of trees. We walk andsurvive on land. It is literally the base of our ecosystem. It is in our good interest to takecare of it and nurture it.​</a>

Pollution in water, air and more can be handle but only for now, if this goes on we might not have any oxygen for us to breathe in the near future. Diseases like stroke because of global warming or the heat that we can't handle anymore can k*ll us and our earth which we can all die at once, not now but not so soon too. We should protect and change for the better future.</p><p></p><p>(correct me if am wrong :&gt;)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Conserve Water</p><p>The little things can make a big difference. Every time you turn off the water while you’re brushing your teeth, you’re doing something good. Got a leaky faucet? You might be dripping as much as 90 gallons (340 liters) of water down the drain every day [source: EPA]. So fix it! It’s easy and cheap. And stop drinking bottled water. Switch to filtered tap water. You’ll save a ton of cash and help reduce a ton of plastic waste in the process.</p><p></p><p>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</p><p>You can help reduce pollution just by putting that soda can in the recycling bin. It really does make a difference. Paper, too. Case in point: If an office building of 7,000 workers recycled all of its office paper waste for a year, it would be the equivalent of taking almost 400 cars off the road [source: EPA]. But you can also take reusable bags to the grocery, and avoid using disposable plates, spoons, glass, cups and napkins. They create huge amounts of waste. And buy products that are made of recycled materials. It all makes a difference.</p><p></p><p>Live Energy Wise</p><p>Make your home more energy efficient (and save money). Your home’s windows are responsible for 25 to 30 percent of residential heat gain and heat loss. If they’re old and inefficient, consider replacing them. Also be sure your home has proper insulation. Insulation is measured in terms of its thermal resistance or R-value — the higher the R-value, the more effective the insulation. The amount of insulation your home needs depends on the climate, type of HVAC system, and where you’re adding the insulation. Smaller things you can do right away include replacing your air filter regularly so your HVAC system doesn’t have to work overtime. Keep your window treatments closed when it’s extremely hot and cold outside. You can also consider installing a programmable thermostat like Nest so your system isn’t running (and wasting energy) when you’re not home.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana makatulong pa brainliest ( ;</p><br />

Do this in your notebookLand pollution is when humans introduce harmful objects, chemicals or substances,directly or indirectly into the soil in a way that causes harm to other living things or destroyssoil or water ecosystems. It can be caused due to agricultural sources, ashes, miningsources, industrial sources, sewage treatment, garbage or waste, constructions sources,deforestation, chemical and nuclear plants and oil refineries.When deforestation is committed, the tree cover is compromised on. This leads to asteep imbalance in the rain cycle. A disturbed rain cycle affects a lot of factors. To beginwith, the green cover is reduced. Trees and plants help balance the atmosphere, withoutthem we are subjected to various concerns like Global warming, the greenhouse effect,irregular rainfall and flash floods among other imbalances,Solution for land pollution is 1) Make people aware about the concept of Reduce,Recycle and Reuse. 2) Reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural activities. 3)Buy biodegradable products. 4) Do Organic gardening and eat organic food that will begrown without the use of pesticides. 5) Plant a greater number of trees. We walk andsurvive on land. It is literally the base of our ecosystem. It is in our good interest to takecare of it and nurture it.​</h2><br />
