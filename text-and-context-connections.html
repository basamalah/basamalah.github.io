Only few writers borrow ideas from previous works to give a layer of meaning to their own works .8. In discovering a text's context, we must also ask the issues that deal with it .9. An inter text is effective even without the reader's prior knowledge and understanding of the original text .10. Text contains many layer of accumulated , cultural, historical, and social knowledge, which continually adds to and affect one another.11. Accidental intertextuality is when readers often connect a text with another text , cultural practice or personal experience , without there being any tangible anchorpoint within the original text .12. The intent of the writer when using optional intertextuality , is to pay homage to the 'original' writers, order reward those who have read the hypotext.13. Lampoons , parodies, and pastiches are examples of hypertext.14. in Hypertext , information can be presented in semantic network in which multiple related sections of the text are connected to each other.15. Obligatory intertextuality relies on reading or understanding of a prior hypo text, before for comprehension of the hypertext can be achieved .​</a>
