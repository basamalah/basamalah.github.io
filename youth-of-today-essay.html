                            2. essay about the voices of youth today​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The voice of youth is a powerful force that can drive change in society. Young people have a unique perspective on the world and often bring fresh ideas and innovative solutions to the challenges we face. Their energy, passion and creativity can inspire and motivate others to take action, and their voices can be a powerful tool for advocacy and social change.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant ways in which young people use their voices is through activism. From the civil rights movement of the 1960s to the climate strikes of today, young people have played a pivotal role in driving social and political change. They have organized protests, created social media campaigns, and used their social networks to raise awareness and mobilize others.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the voice of youth has been particularly prominent in the fight against climate change. Young people around the world have taken to the streets to demand action from their governments and corporations, and have used social media to amplify their message and build a global movement. Their efforts have helped to raise public awareness about the urgency of the climate crisis and have put pressure on leaders to take bold action to address it.</p><p></p><p>The voice of youth is also important in shaping public policy. While young people may not have the right to vote, they still have the power to influence decision-makers through advocacy and public engagement. By sharing their perspectives and experiences, they can help to shape policies that reflect their needs and priorities, and that are more responsive to the challenges facing young people today.</p><p></p><p>In addition to activism and policy advocacy, the voice of youth is also important in promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Young people are often at the forefront of efforts to challenge stereotypes, combat discrimination and promote social justice. They bring new perspectives to conversations about race, gender, sexuality and other forms of identity, and can help to create more inclusive and welcoming communities.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the voice of youth is a powerful force that can drive change in society. Young people have unique perspectives on the world and can bring fresh ideas and innovative solutions to the challenges we face. Through activism, policy advocacy and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, young people can use their voices to shape a better world for themselves and future generations.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>see answer below</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Challenges that a youth faces today</p><p>   -Today the tension on them to perform is the most noteworthy than it at any point was in any of the ages. One reason for this is that, today we are more associated with one another than before because of downpour of web-based media and this prompts the adolescent contrasting themselves as well as other people to a great extent. The split between the have and those who lack wealth is a lot bigger and this prompts uneasiness and hotshot occurring from the school level itself. Because of double pay idea, the two guardians are working and they add to the pressure by putting their assumptions on the youngsters without having a lot of time to help them inwardly. The youthful age today is either running with pressure and anxiety to accomplish or have surrendered any desire for doing anything advantageous.
</p><p>
As a result of these reasons, the young today profess to carry on with a way of life which isn't theirs in the mission to keep awake or be associated with the companionships or gathering of people they have assembled.

                        Youth of any country of any era in this world were and are always same.. If you consider youth of USA in 1960’s or In Germany in 1960’s or in India in 1960’s all were same.. and till today its same.. any how few differences are there but only due to the resources of any country or region.<br /><br />We are discussing about youth.. not about the ability of a particular nation or its governing body to do so. In my simple words Youth of any where in this world in any of era they are Passionate, focused (if possible), stubborn to do something, over capable or over confident, not to listen but to preform something more..<br /><br />However the reality is different in any country in any era, when they got realize it.. they will be no more youth and time has passes way miles back.. Only on that time the country and region will make the differences, that how the particular who freshly got to know the reality, will preform in real life with there present boons and banes of homeland where he/she born, where he/she broad up, where he/she became youth, where he/she got to know the reality and lastly where he/she preform in the game of life without any intimation of challenges and quest of there life.<br /><br />But According to me the youth are Same.. without any experience.. with full of energy and Courage for anything in life.<br />

                        <p>I believe Aristotle said that the youth of today are not as good as the youth of yesterday. With that in mind, people have always compared the faults of the current generation to an idealized version that they can or choose to remember. In the past they still smoked weed, got drunk and had sex. However they did not have the ability to learn as quickly or communicate as well as the current youth. In the end we can't say that one generation is better than another, because they both have strong points and they both have faults. What we can do is ask, "What can we learn from the youth of 50 years ago to help the youth of today."</p><p></p><p></p><p>CARRY ON LEARNING THAY WAS ONLY AN IDEA</p><p></p><br />

                            22. • Write a five paragraph essay about the importance of education among the youth today​</h2><br />
                        <p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p>Education is an essential aspect of life that plays a significant role in shaping the future of the youth. Education is a process of acquiring knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes that enable individuals to live successful lives. The importance of education among the youth today cannot be overstated, and it is an essential tool for equipping them with skills and knowledge required to thrive in the ever-evolving global economy. In this essay, I will outline the importance of education among the youth today.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, education is a fundamental human right that every child is entitled to. Education serves as a platform for empowering the youth with knowledge and skills that enable them to create a better future for themselves and their communities. Without education, young people may lack the necessary skills to get better jobs, engage in civic duties, and generally be productive members of society. It is through education that they develop critical thinking abilities, problem-solving skills, and creativity, all of which are crucial in adapting to the current dynamic and diverse world.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, education provides opportunities that empower young people and prepares them to tackle the various challenges they may face in life. Education plays a crucial role in breaking cyclical poverty experienced in underdeveloped regions. It opens doors for them to better job opportunities and promotes economic growth. The attainment of education has been linked to reduced teenage pregnancies, better health outcomes as well as reduced crime rates. Through various education programs, young people gain exposure to new cultures and ideas, enabling them to learn and understand the diversity and complexity of the world that surrounds them.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, education is an essential tool for shaping the values, behavior, and attitudes of young people. It plays a crucial role in promoting social cohesion and unity among diverse communities. Education develops in young people a sense of self-awareness, self-esteem, and empathy. As a result, they become more aware of their contribution to society and are more likely to become actively involved in their communities. Through education, young people develop respect for other cultures, religious beliefs, and diversity, which leads to societal harmony and peaceful coexistence.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, education serves as a tool for personal development, enabling young people to achieve their full potential. Education equips young people with the right skills and knowledge that enable them to excel in diverse fields, from entrepreneurship to leadership roles. Education provides them with the opportunities to learn from experienced individuals and mentorships. The opportunities widen their horizons and open up pathways for personal growth and self-fulfillment.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, education is critical for the development of young people in today's society. It serves as a tool for empowering the youth, providing them with opportunities to excel, and shaping their values and attitudes towards society. Education, therefore, needs to be promoted and fostered among the youth to ensure that they become more productive, active, and responsible members of society.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Though a common target for health-improving efforts, young people are not often regarded as agents of change for healthier communities. However, a growing number of successful health-supportive policy, environment, and systems-change efforts trace their impetus to youth involvement.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainiliest po</p>A person’s overall health is about much more than the absence of disease. It’s the state of physical, mental, and social well-being. Ultimately, it’s the key to living a productive and satisfying life.<br /><br />Path to Improved Health<br />You can break down the concept of health into different categories. These could include physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral health. There are things any person can do to stay healthy in these areas. But as a teenager, there are some things you should pay special attention to.<br /><br />Physical health: Taking care of your body<br />Exercise regularly. Teens should be physically active at least 60 minutes of every day.<br />Eat a healthy diet. Healthy eating is an important part of your growth and development. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, a variety of protein foods, and low-fat dairy products.<br />Maintain a healthy weight. Children and teenagers with obesity are more likely to have obesity as an adult. They are also at higher risk for other chronic illnesses, depression, and bullying.<br />Get enough sleep. Most teens need between 9 and 9 ½ hours of sleep every night. Many average only 7 hours. Sleep has a strong effect on your ability to concentrate and do well at school.<br />Keep up with vaccinations. Get a flu shot every year. If you haven’t gotten the HPV vaccine, ask your parents and doctor about it. It can prevent you from getting HPV and some kinds of cancer, including cervical cancer.<br />Brush and floss your teeth. Make it a habit now, and prevent tooth and gum problems in adulthood.<br />Wear sunscreen. Getting just one bad sunburn as a child or teenager increases your risk of getting skin cancer as an adult.<br />Don’t listen to loud music. This can damage your hearing for the rest of your life.<br /><br />Mental health: Taking care of your mind<br />Learn ways to manage stress. You can’t avoid stress, so you need to learn how to manage it. This will help you stay calm and be able to function in stressful situations.<br />Study and do your best in school. There is a strong link between health and academic success.<br />Try to maintain a good relationship with your parents. Remember that they want what is best for you. Try to see where they are coming from when they set rules.<br />Develop a good balance between school, work, and social life.<br />Don’t try to take on too much. Limit your activities to the most important ones and give those 100%. Overextending yourself can lead to stress, frustration, or exhaustion.<br /><br /><br />
