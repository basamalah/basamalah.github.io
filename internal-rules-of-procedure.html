                                            Education, through its institutions such as schools, colleges and universities, has been understood and believed to represent the best hope for better future of Filipinos particularly the poor that comprise the majority of Filipinos.  Education, however, cannot deliver this as its capacity is defined and thus limited by the country’s dominant political and economic sectors that dictate what education institutions can and cannot do. For instance, schools, colleges and universities are made to accommodate expanding numbers of students without loss to the quality of teaching (and research) and learning. Its capacity to adapt curricula to fit the emerging requirements of highly diverse students is likewise limited and/or the institutions’ capacity to innovate their internal processes of teaching, assessing students, managing, etc. to respond to the needs of the broader education constituencies is likewise defined and limited by government’s prescribed provisions, systems, rules, regulations, and procedures.

Education, through its institutions such as schools, colleges and universities, has been understood and believed to represent the best hope for better future of Filipinos particularly the poor that comprise the majority of Filipinos.  Education, however, cannot deliver this as its capacity is defined and thus limited by the country’s dominant political and economic sectors that dictate what education institutions can and cannot do. For instance, schools, colleges and universities are made to accommodate expanding numbers of students without loss to the quality of teaching (and research) and learning. Its capacity to adapt curricula to fit the emerging requirements of highly diverse students is likewise limited and/or the institutions’ capacity to innovate their internal processes of teaching, assessing students, managing, etc. to respond to the needs of the broader education constituencies is likewise defined and limited by government’s prescribed provisions, systems, rules, regulations, and procedures.
