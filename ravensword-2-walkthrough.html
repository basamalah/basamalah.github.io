When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties.

Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens.

Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

                                            Patrick D. Flores, Director of Philippine Contemporary Art Network (PCAN), asserted in an exhibition walkthrough during the inauguration of PCAN in 2017 that “The place where the artists are from produces a particular form. The form eventually casts a certain expression for the place…The place also forms a subjectivity, but the subjectivity has a life of its own.” Expound the relevant ideas implied in Dr. Flores’s statement about the nature of regional contemporary arts through writing a short essay with 10 - 15 sentences.

A. Artists are able to independently market themselves and sell their pieces online.
B. Museums now keep online collections and host online walkthroughs of their facilities.
C. Artists can now paint on an iPad just as well as they can on canvas with a paintbrush and paint.
D. Technology makes artists more accessible, more transparent and makes the sales process more streamlined.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There is this widespread notion that it must be pretty tough for an artist to create artworks these days. After all, technology has heavily dominated the world in the 21st century, and how can art compete with that? Especially when art is an old field and technology is a new field that’s already taking the world by storm. For a lot of people, they think that the answer is crystal clear: it’s a losing battle for art, considering that technology is the obvious winner.</p><p></p><p>To be fair, that assumption has some sense to it, even if it’s a tiny one. It is true that technology rules the world right now. But one thing that people always forget to consider is the fact that art doesn’t exist in a vacuum — yes, it has been around for millennia, literally speaking, and the primary reason why it has continued to last so long is because of the fact that it adapts. No matter what time period it is, what country, or what social climate — art will always find a way to integrate its surroundings to its trends. In other words, the real world helps shape art in a way.</p><p></p><p>So, with that said, it’s more accurate to say that technology is more a friend to art than a foe. But the question remains: how exactly does technology help contemporary artists with their art, especially now in 2019 and onwards? </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>ayan na</p><br />

These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

                            15. Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects.

                            17. Patrick D. Flores, Director of Philippine Contemporary Art Network (PCAN), asserted in an exhibition walkthrough during the inauguration of PCAN in 2017 that “The place where the artists are from produces a particular form. The form eventually casts a certain expression for the place…The place also forms a subjectivity, but the subjectivity has a life of its own.” Expound the relevant ideas implied in Dr. Flores’s statement about the nature of regional contemporary arts through writing a short essay with 10 - 15 sentences. Cite related examples from the data you studied about the Contemporary Arts and Practices of MIMAROPA to support your claims. Write your essay on the space provided below.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It’s meant to actually harness the resources of Philippine contemporary art. Of course, we all know that it’s a very active scene. Many artists are doing work, artist collectives are thriving, and the market is strong. The discourse is higher. One of the aims of PCAN is to consolidate and harness the resources of Philippine contemporary art.</p><br />
