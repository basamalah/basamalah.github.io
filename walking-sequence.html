Directions: Rewrite a story given below using either flashback or in medias res. Specify the technique used to
develop the plot
Ken is one of the most dedicated pupils in elementary. Although his family cannot afford some of
his needs as a pupil, he always walks at recognition day to accept his awards. During the last quarter in
grade six, he is confident that he is going to get another award for his family, but the COVID 19 cases grew
bigger. People's movements were limited, classes were suspended, and community quarantine was
implemented. Even his final walk as an elementary pupil did not happen. He felt lonely and disappointed
about not walking in the middle of the crowd with his parents. But his parents were aware that he is not
feeling good about the situation. They explained to Ken that there is nothing to worry about and that.
they are still proud of him. There are still chances on being with him, walking in the middle of the crowd,
to get his diploma and awards. He felt happy and continued to study, the best way he can.
