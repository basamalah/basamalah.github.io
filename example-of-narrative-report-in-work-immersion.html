                        <p><strong>A</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>W</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>k</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Work Immersion was a defining point in my life. It was a period of learning and growth, both personally and professionally. The experience taught me the importance of social graces in the workplace.</p><p></p><p>I was placed with a prestigious law firm, and I was immediately thrown into a professional environment. Everyone had a certain level of etiquette that was expected and that I was expected to abide by—from the way we greeted each other in the morning, to the way we took coffee orders. I didn’t quite understand the importance of those social graces at first, but as the weeks passed, I noticed that it had an effect on how people interacted. I started to pick up on cues easily, such as the right time to introduce myself to someone, or when it was okay to ask a question. It helped me become a better listener and understand the expectations of the firm.</p><p></p><p>I continued to hone my social graces at work and began to understand the business world more. For example, I learned to be diplomatic and tactful when having conversations, especially with clients and colleagues. I also learned how to handle stress in a constructive manner, rather than getting worked up over small matters. </p><p></p><p><strong>B</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>W</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>k</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>It was my first day of social grace work immersion and I was feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. I had been looking forward to this opportunity for months and now the moment had finally arrived! I knew that if I wanted to make the most of this experience I had to go into it with an open mind and be prepared to take on any task that I was given.</p><p></p><p>The first activity of the day was a workshop about workplace etiquette. We were taught how to greet colleagues and superiors, dress appropriately and use appropriate language. We also discussed the importance of maintaining a professional attitude and how to handle challenging situations in the workplace.</p><p></p><p>Once the workshop was over, it was time to go out onto the floor and observe how things were done. I watched various departments and employees interact, noting the different approaches they took when dealing with customers. I saw how managers dealt with complaints and how staff handled difficult tasks. It was clear to me that everyone was doing their best to make sure the workplace ran smoothly.</p><p></p><p><strong>C</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>C</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong> </strong><strong>G</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>d</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>c</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>:</strong> The idea of being able to make your passion your profession can be both exciting and daunting. It takes courage and tenacity to pursue a career that you are truly passionate about, but the rewards can be immense. With the right guidance and advice, anyone can find ways to turn their passion into a successful, rewarding career.</p><p></p><p>As a starting point for anyone considering turning their passion into a profession, it is important to remember that success does not come overnight. Having a clear plan with achievable goals will help you stay focused and organized. Take the time to research the industry, evolving trends, and any potential obstacles you may face. Knowing the pitfalls and potential rewards associated with a specific career path will go a long way in helping you achieve success.</p><p></p><p>In addition to researching the industry, networking is an invaluable tool when building a career in any field. Reach out to industry professionals, whether it be through industry events or online groups. Make sure to have an elevator pitch prepared that clearly states your goals, values, and interests.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A. Work Immersion: Social Graces in the Workplace</p><p></p><p>During my work immersion, I learned a lot about the importance of social graces in the workplace. It is not just about having the technical skills to do your job, but also about having the right attitude and behavior towards your colleagues and superiors.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that I observed is the way people greet each other. It may seem like a small thing, but it sets the tone for the entire day. Saying good morning or good afternoon with a smile and a nod is a simple yet effective way to show respect and acknowledge someone's presence.</p><p></p><p>Another aspect of social graces is communication. It is important to listen attentively and speak politely to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts. One of my colleagues taught me the importance of using "please" and "thank you" in every conversation, no matter how small or trivial it may seem.</p><p></p><p>I also learned about the value of punctuality. Being on time shows that you respect other people's time and that you are committed to your work. It also helps to create a positive impression, especially when meeting clients or attending meetings.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my work immersion experience taught me that social graces are essential in creating a harmonious and productive workplace. It is not just about the technical skills, but also about the way you treat others and conduct yourself in a professional setting.</p><p></p><p>B. Work Immersion: Things to do in the Workplace</p><p></p><p>During my work immersion, I discovered that there are many things to do in the workplace aside from the actual work itself. These activities not only help to break the monotony of work, but also help to build camaraderie among colleagues.</p><p></p><p>One of the things that we did was to organize team building activities. We had an outdoor activity where we did a series of challenges that required teamwork and communication. It was a fun way to bond with my colleagues and learn to work together towards a common goal.</p><p></p><p>Another activity that we did was to organize a sportsfest. We had different sports events such as basketball, volleyball, and badminton. It was a great way to promote physical fitness and healthy competition among colleagues.</p><p></p><p>We also had a charity event where we volunteered our time and resources to help the less fortunate. We visited a local orphanage and spent time with the children. It was a humbling experience that reminded us of the importance of giving back to the community.</p><p></p><p>Overall, my work immersion experience taught me that there are many things to do in the workplace aside from work. These activities not only help to break the monotony of work, but also help to build strong relationships and promote a positive workplace culture.</p><p></p><p>C. Career Guidance: Make Your Passion Your Profession</p><p></p><p>Choosing a career can be a daunting task, especially if you are unsure of what you want to do. However, one of the best ways to make a decision is to follow your passion.</p><p></p><p>During my career guidance session, I realized that my passion lies in photography. I have always been fascinated by the art of capturing moments and telling stories through images. So, I decided to pursue a career in photography.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to gain the necessary skills and knowledge. I enrolled in a photography course and learned the technical aspects of photography such as lighting, composition, and editing. I also attended workshops and seminars to learn from experienced photographers.</p><p></p><p>The next step was to gain experience. I started by doing freelance photography jobs such as weddings and events. This helped me to hone my skills and build my portfolio. I also joined a photography club where I met like-minded individuals and learned from their experiences.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, I was able to turn my passion into a profession. I started my own photography business and now, I am able to do what I love every day.</p><p></p><p>My career guidance experience taught me that following your passion can lead to</p><p></p><br />

                            27. Give me experiences of agriculture for work immersion
NARRATIVE REPORT</h2><br />
                        Agriculture is one of our country’s primary economic source of income. Many Filipinos still and most farmers say, enjoying living in rural areas and supporting their families through agriculture. To mention, some of our main agricultural crops are rice, corn, bananas, pineapple, sugarcane, coconut, tobacco, mangoes, coffee and abaca. <br /><br /> To name a few of my unforgettable agricultural experiences during work immersion are the following: having a hard time selecting the variety of crop to be planted or cultured since our country has different climates. You have to select the appropriate crops for the present climate. <br />Having a good and continuous water supply or water irrigation is a must. There are crops that need less water while other crops grow healthily with plenty of water. Proper cultivation and right amount of fertilizer is vital. I remembered putting extra fertilizer to one of our pechay beds, with the thought the it will grow faster and greener, but sad to say all of our seedlings are withered when I checked them the following day. <br />You also need to consider proper ventilation. Some crops need a lot of sunshine while other crops prefer a shady location. Proper agriculture attire and tools are also a must to avoid accidents or unnecessary incident.<br /> Some people call it crazy but I do talk to my plants. I visit and ask them how they are as if I am talking to a friend. I am also asking them to grow fast and healthy. Sometimes we can not avoid bad weather condition, so I also include them to my prayers. And when harvest time arrives, I am whispering my gratefulness to them.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong><strong>)</strong> <strong>During my work immersion experience, I learned the importance of social graces in the workplace. It is crucial to maintain a professional demeanor at all times, whether it be through proper communication, punctuality, or dress code. I observed that a respectful attitude towards colleagues and superiors can go a long way in building positive relationships and creating a harmonious work environment. Additionally, being able to adapt to different work styles and personalities is a valuable skill that can enhance productivity and teamwork. Overall, my work immersion experience has taught me that social graces are not just niceties, but essential components of a successful career.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>B.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>During my work immersion, I learned that there are several things that one can do in the workplace to make the most out of the experience. First and foremost, it is important to always be punctual and arrive on time for work. This shows respect for your employer and colleagues and sets a good example for others. Additionally, it is important to be proactive and take initiative in your work. This means asking questions, seeking feedback, and taking on additional responsibilities when possible. Finally, it is important to maintain a positive attitude and work well with others. By being a team player and fostering positive relationships with colleagues, you can create a more enjoyable and productive work environment.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>C.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>As we grow up, we are often asked what we want to be when we grow up. For some, the answer comes easily, while for others, it takes time to figure out. I was one of those who took time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I tried different things, but nothing seemed to fit until I found my passion. I realized that my passion could be turned into a profession. It was not an easy journey, but with guidance and hard work, I was able to turn my passion into a successful career. I believe that if you have a passion for something, you should pursue it and make it your profession. It may not be easy, but it will be worth it in the end.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>SANA </strong><strong>MAKA </strong><strong>TULONG</strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p></p><br />
