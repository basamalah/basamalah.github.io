NASA’s new rover Perseverance launches for Mars to seek signs of past life Published by Joey Roulette on July 30, 2020 NASA's next-generation Mars rover Perseverance blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on Thursday atop an Atlas 5 rocket on a $2.4-billion mission to search for traces of potential past life on Earth's planetary neighbor. The next-generation robotic rover—a car-sized six-wheeled scientific vehicle—also is scheduled to deploy a mini helicopter on Mars and test out equipment for future human missions to the fourth planet from the sun. It is expected to reach Mars next February. It soared into the sky under clear, sunny and warm conditions carried by an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. The launch took place after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California where its mission engineers were located was rattled by an earthquake. This marked NASA's ninth journey to the Martian surface. Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars—once a much more hospitable place than it is today—ever harbored life. Water is considered a key ingredient for life, and Mars billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost. One of the most complex maneuvers in Perseverance's journey will be what mission engineers call the "seven minutes of terror," when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet's surface. This was scheduled as the third launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China. The state from which the rover was launched, Florida, is currently one of the hot spots in the United States for the coronavirus pandemic. Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time. Since NASA's first Mars rover Sojourner landed in 1997, the agency has sent two others—Spirit and Opportunity—that have explored the geology of expansive Martian plains and detected signs of past water formations, among other discoveries. NASA also has successfully sent three landers: Pathfinder, Phoenix, InSight. The United States has plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s under a program that envisions using a return to the moon as a testing platform for human missions before making the more ambitious crewed journey to Mars. Perseverance will conduct an experiment to convert elements of the carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere into propellant for future rockets launching off the planet's surface, or to produce breathable oxygen for future astronauts. The rover also is intended to help bring Martian rock samples back to Earth, collecting materials in cigar-sized capsules and leaving them in various spots on the surface for retrieval by a future "fetch" rover. That planned rover is expected to launch the samples back into space to link up with other spacecraft for an eventual Earth homecoming around 2031. —

Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</a>

NASA’s new rover Perseverance launches for Mars to seek signs of past life Published by Joey Roulette on July 30, 2020 NASA's next-generation Mars rover Perseverance blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on Thursday atop an Atlas 5 rocket on a $2.4-billion mission to search for traces of potential past life on Earth's planetary neighbor. The next-generation robotic rover—a car-sized six-wheeled scientific vehicle—also is scheduled to deploy a mini helicopter on Mars and test out equipment for future human missions to the fourth planet from the sun. It is expected to reach Mars next February. It soared into the sky under clear, sunny and warm conditions carried by an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. The launch took place after the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California where its mission engineers were located was rattled by an earthquake. This marked NASA's ninth journey to the Martian surface. Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars—once a much more hospitable place than it is today—ever harbored life. Water is considered a key ingredient for life, and Mars billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost. One of the most complex maneuvers in Perseverance's journey will be what mission engineers call the "seven minutes of terror," when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet's surface. This was scheduled as the third launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China. The state from which the rover was launched, Florida, is currently one of the hot spots in the United States for the coronavirus pandemic. Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time. Since NASA's first Mars rover Sojourner landed in 1997, the agency has sent two others—Spirit and Opportunity—that have explored the geology of expansive Martian plains and detected signs of past water formations, among other discoveries. NASA also has successfully sent three landers: Pathfinder, Phoenix, InSight. The United States has plans to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s under a program that envisions using a return to the moon as a testing platform for human missions before making the more ambitious crewed journey to Mars. Perseverance will conduct an experiment to convert elements of the carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere into propellant for future rockets launching off the planet's surface, or to produce breathable oxygen for future astronauts. The rover also is intended to help bring Martian rock samples back to Earth, collecting materials in cigar-sized capsules and leaving them in various spots on the surface for retrieval by a future "fetch" rover. That planned rover is expected to launch the samples back into space to link up with other spacecraft for an eventual Earth homecoming around 2031. —

Follow this same type of format to write your journal entries. Notice how the journal entry describes everyday tasks and technologies about our present day. Your journal will need to do the same while describing tasks and technologies from the past.Saturday, October 6, 2007What a busy day today! I never had a moment’s rest. The day started with my alarmclock blaring at 7am. I had to be at the Smith’s house by 8am to baby-sit. I really didn’t wantto wake up so early on a Saturday, but I’m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn’t sayno to an all-day babysitting job.When I arrived at the Smith’s house, both kids were already awake. Madison waswatching cartoons in living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. Thekids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfasttogether.We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob’s soccer practice. Luckily, the Smithsonly live a couple blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. It was a lot of funwatching Jacob play soccer. He’s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored,but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. It’s always a breezeto make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. All I hadto do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disneymovie. The movie theatre is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom topick us up in her car and drive us there. The kids loved the movie; they couldn’t stoplaughing. I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. The only bad part was that thetheatre had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. Wehad only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect herhome so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called tosee if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then metDanielle at her house.While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for muchlonger since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was afun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</h2><br />

</p><p>My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith’s house. We
</p><p>
</p><p>had only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home. I didn’t expect her
</p><p>
</p><p>home so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.
</p><p>
</p><p>It worked out very well though because as soon as I left the Smith’s, Danielle called to
</p><p>
</p><p>see if I wanted to go to the mall. I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then met
</p><p>
</p><p>Danielle at her house.
</p><p>
</p><p>While we were at the mall, we definitely “shopped ‘til we dropped”. I bought a t-shirt,
</p><p>
</p><p>a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. I know that I won’t need the flip flops for much
</p><p>
</p><p>longer since it’s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn’t pass them up.
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. Today was a
</p><p>
</p><p>fun day, but I can’t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</p><p></p><br />
