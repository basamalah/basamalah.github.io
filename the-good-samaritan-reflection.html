                        THE PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN:_____________________<p>The most important moral lesson of the parable is that we can sin without violating any commandment, we have to choose between righteousness and sin, between the spirit and the flesh, the parable is not a case of simple mercy, that is a simple and erroneous analysis. He showed us that racism has no place in charity. And that we should help others regardless of where they came from or what they believe in. After all, we are all created equal, no one race is superior nor inferior from the other. And at the end of the day, we all belong to the same race and humanity. The moral of the story is that we should put aside our differences and help those who are in need of help. This story also teaches us that people who we think might help us in need may not always be there for us. The most valuable lessons from the Good Samaritan parable that relates so much to life today is that we should always Help when someone needs help, Race should be matter, Be kind even to our haters, Help Without Expecting Something in Return, and we'll must donate to the poor.</p><p></p><p>[tex]#CarryOnLearning[/tex]</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Reflection on the Parable of the Good Samaritan
</p><p>the second sub-theme for Catholic Education Week is “Mercy that Loves.” January has been designated as the month in which we ponder this theme, and the Parable of the Good Samaritan is the scripture passage suggested for our pondering. The idea of a Good Samaritan has, of course, taken on a life of its own. The Good Samaritan is a synonym for someone good, noble, selfless, helpful, especially someone who, often at great personal risk, comes to the aid of a person in dire need, distress or danger. There are many churches and hospitals named after this Gospel hero, as well as civic organizations and philanthropic agencies that provide support to those in need, shelters, family aid societies and much more.  likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion, and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.’To go down on one’s own from Jerusalem to Jericho is, even today, not without risk. In the time of Jesus it was fraught with peril. Strabo, in his famous Geography, tells us that Pompey had to wipe out “strongholds of brigands” near Jericho. The fate of the lone traveller is almost anticipated; he is beaten, robbed, and left for dead. He lies in the ditch naked, without the signs of either nationality or social status, both of which were indicated by what people wore. He is simply a person in need. Now, ‘by chance,’ the story goes on to tell us, a priest and a Levite came along and, when they saw the naked man in the ditch, crossed to the other side and passed by. The priesthood in Jerusalem, it should be noted, constituted a kind of Jewish nobility or upper-class. The priest was regarded, therefore, as a prominent representative of Jewish piety. The Levite, also, commanded respect in the community. He belonged to an order of lower clergy who served in the temple as teachers, gatekeepers, musicians, and janitors. The priest and the Levite are the ultimate insiders. The people listening to Jesus’ story would surely have expected that they are brought on the scene precisely to take care of the man in the ditch, to show him love and mercy. They were, like we are, shocked by the revelation that these two religious leaders, instead of showing love and mercy, callously walked past a man dying on the side of the road. The story, as David Garland points out in his monumental Commentary on Luke, “presents the failure of religious leaders to be humane and follow the dictates of Scripture, and it casts aspersions on the institution they served” The next character to appear in the story is a Samaritan. One might have expected a Jewish layperson. After all, the traditional triad at the time of Christ was “priests, Levites, and all the people of Israel.” These were the three categories of the social hierarchy that dominated Judaism after the Babylonian Exile. Maybe one of “the people” would come along and show the mercy withheld by the priest and Levite. But the story shocks its hearers by bringing on scene, instead, a Samaritan. Two hundred years before Christ, the writer of the Book of Sirach called the Samaritans “no nation” (50:25-26), Samaritans were excluded from the temple cult in Jerusalem. They could not witness in court because they were judged to be liars. One of the most insulting names Jesus is called by his fellow Jews is “Samaritan” (John 8:48). Yet the only fellow traveller on that Jericho road who stopped to help a dying man was this hated outsider. Now, we are not told what the priest and Levite felt when they saw the man in the ditch. Fear may have taken hold of them, fear for their own skin. But we are told that the Samaritan was moved with compassion. “</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>This reflection on John 4:5-14 considers how Jesus values the people scorned by others, in this instance a Samaritan Woman.</p><p></p><p>John 4:5-14</p><p></p><p></p><p>So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 6Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon. 7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” 8  (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) 9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?” (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.)</p><p></p><p>10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” 11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? 12 Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?”</p><p></p><p>13 Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, 14 but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.”</p><p></p><p>New Revised Standard Version</p><p></p><p>Reflection</p><p>Strict Jews may have avoided Samaria altogether, choosing to take a longer journey to get to Galilee. But in choosing to go to Samaria and to engage with the people there, Jesus showed that he held a different view.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Jews, the Samaritans did not worship God correctly, as they did not go to the temple in Jerusalem and they adopted the practices of the neighbouring religions. The Samaritans’ religious practices were considered to be offensive by the Jews, rendering them unclean. When Jesus asked the woman to draw him water from the well, he broke several traditional views, not only by associating with a Samaritan and being willing to drink from what would be deemed an unclean vessel, but also by speaking to a woman on her own. Jesus was able to look beyond the cultural expectations; he was not tainted by the hatred and prejudice prevalent at the time. Jesus saw the woman as a person in need of good news and the life he had to offer.</p><p></p><p>Are we able to look beyond the perspectives of our own culture when it contradicts the way God sees things?</p><p></p><p>In the Jewish faith, water was used often as a powerful metaphor. In such a semi-arid environment water was a precious gift to relieve thirst and bring refreshment. It gives the writer of Psalm 42 inspiration when he says “As a deer longs for flowing streams, so my soul longs for you, O God” (v 1). Jesus in this passage is making it clear that he is using living water as a metaphor for eternal life. Jesus does not bypass this woman or seek someone more socially acceptable to offer his precious gift to, he chooses her.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The parable of the Good Samaritan is told by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke.[Lk 10:25–37] It is about a traveller who is stripped of clothing, beaten, and left half dead alongside the road. First a Jewish priest and then a Levite comes by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a Samaritan happens upon the traveller. Samaritans and Jews despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man. Jesus is described as telling the parable in response to the question from a lawyer, "And who is my neighbour?". The conclusion is that the neighbour figure in the parable is the one who shows mercy to the injured fellow man—that is, the Samaritan.Some Christians, such as Augustine, have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul. Others, however, discount this allegory as unrelated to the parable's original meaning and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus.</p><p></p><p>The parable has inspired painting, sculpture, satire, poetry, photography, and film.

                            22. Personal reflections about the"Parable of good samaritan"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Good Samaritan is one of the most infamous stories the bible has to offer, showing how it takes one to help someone. The parable of the Good Samaritan shows the morals of society that has been lost to selfishness. As a result, individuals may never realize how altruism is contagious and how one’s efforts can have a long-term impact on the lives of others. In Nicholas Kristof’s article, “She May Have Saved a Life. Then She Was Arrested.”, the speaker informs the audience of an event in which a woman was arrested while trying to help migrant children stuck on the side of the road in order to urge people to not lose their values and to remain true to their beliefs. The speaker argues his point, that humanity cannot be lost due to societal norms, through the use of connotative diction, historical allusions, and the appeal to emotion. Kristof’s purpose is underscored by the speaker’s word choice used to describe the events that had occurred to Teresa L. Todd, the woman that helped the migrant children. The speaker describes Todd’s actions as “[C]ompassion overriding any fear” (par. 2). Compassion denotes an underlying sense of sympathy and understanding, Kristof uses this to highlight the characteristics of Todd. Furthermore, Kristof uses a sympathetic choice of words throughout the article, “[T]hree desperate Central American migrants waved frantically at her car” (par. 1), he does this to illuminate the event and invoke empathy. The speaker is exposing the feelings and characteristics of the individuals of his article, using specific phrases and words to convey the different morals of society. The author illustrates the events listed in his article using a parable, The Good Samaritan as found in the bible in the book of Luke. Using this notorious story as a basis of his argument allows Kristof to form a connection from Todd’s story to the Good Samaritan and how they are similar morally. The speaker does this in order to allow the reader to interpret the theme of doing things for the greater good. Kristof writes the parable as a list, going back and forth from the events that happened to the migrant children to the events that happened to the man attacked by robbers in the parable. Kristoff alludes to the bible as he describes how Todd helped those migrant children just as the Samaritan helped the damaged man “But a Samaritan … bandaged his wounds,” (par. 10), by placing the biblical texts under the events of Todd, mirroring the morals of both individuals. The speaker compares the real-life events of Teresa Todd to the biblical story of the Good Samaritan to assert the ideology of helping others in need that has been lost in society. Kristof uses the story of Teresa Todd and the juxtaposition of the parable, the Good Samaritan to persuade his audience of his argument using emotion. The speaker uses the narrative of Teresa Todd to better envision the circumstances of the event taken place, “It was totally surreal, … and what I learned in church was right, which was helping people.” (par. 9). This quote functions as a real experience that the readers take and use to understand and feel the events and argument that the speaker provides. Kristof continues to invoke empathy and understanding when he brings a controversial compelling argument about the current administration of the United States, “The arrest of a mom who may have saved a life reflects the increasingly harsh treatment under President Trump of anyone who tries to help migrants.” (par. 14). As Kristof evokes sympathy in his writing, he also conveys the theme of being a Good Samaritan and wanting to be the person to help others in need. Kristof successfully elicits a sense of altruistic values and commiseration throughout his article that function as a convincing argument. Although it is never stated Kristoff objects to passing by others in need as his tone is candid and cautionary. Helping others takes a positive connotation in the piece and is the subject of his wit and parable. Alluding to an infamous story while using specific word choices to allow the article to have meaning, successfully conveys the overall theme of being selfless in today’s society. Ultimately, the world is ever changing but there are certain morals that will continuously be present and learned for a lifetime. Those morals being, to want to help others because it is the right thing to do.</p><br />
