Strength training specializes in the inducement of muscular contraction through the use of free weights, weight machines, and resistance bands which builds the strength, size of skeletal muscles, and anaerobic endurance. 2. Strength training improves overall health and well-being because the bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments are strengthened and toughened. 3. Strength Training increases metabolism, improves cardiac function, and elevates good cholesterol. 4. A rep (repetition) is one full movement from the starting point to finish. 5. A set is a group of repetitions. 6. Before engaging yourself in the strength training, warm up first through walking. After doing the exercise, cool down for five to ten minutes through stretching. 7. Pay attention to your breathing during workouts. Exhale while working against resistance by lifting, pushing, or pulling and inhale at every release. 8. Keep challenging muscles by slowly increasing weight or resistance. The right weight differs depending on the exercise. 9. Always give the muscles at least 48 hours to recover before the next strength training session. 10. A combination of good exercise routine and consistent intake of a balanced diet can help achieve a well- rounded health and fitness level.​</a>

Strength training specializes in the inducement of muscular contraction through the use of free weights, weight machines, and resistance bands which builds the strength, size of skeletal muscles, and anaerobic endurance. 2. Strength training improves overall health and well-being because the bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments are strengthened and toughened. 3. Strength Training increases metabolism, improves cardiac function, and elevates good cholesterol. 4. A rep (repetition) is one full movement from the starting point to finish. 5. A set is a group of repetitions. 6. Before engaging yourself in the strength training, warm up first through walking. After doing the exercise, cool down for five to ten minutes through stretching. 7. Pay attention to your breathing during workouts. Exhale while working against resistance by lifting, pushing, or pulling and inhale at every release. 8. Keep challenging muscles by slowly increasing weight or resistance. The right weight differs depending on the exercise. 9. Always give the muscles at least 48 hours to recover before the next strength training session. 10. A combination of good exercise routine and consistent intake of a balanced diet can help achieve a well- rounded health and fitness level.​</h2><br />
