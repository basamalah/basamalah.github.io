                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What is an Eating Disorder (ED)?</p><p>Eating Disorders describe illnesses that are characterized by irregular eating habits and severe distress or concern about body weight or shape.</p><p></p><p>Eating disturbances may include inadequate or excessive food intake which can ultimately damage an individual’s well-being. The most common forms of eating disorders include Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, and Binge Eating Disorder and affect both females and males.</p><p></p><p>Signs &amp; Symptoms of an ED:</p><p></p><p>•A man or woman suffering from an eating disorder may reveal several signs and symptoms, some which are:</p><p></p><p>-Chronic dieting despite being hazardously underweight</p><p>-Constant weight fluctuations</p><p>-Obsession with calories and fat contents of food</p><p>-Engaging in ritualistic eating patterns, such as cutting food into tiny pieces, eating alone, and/or hiding food</p><p>-Continued fixation with food, recipes, or cooking; the individual may cook intricate meals for others but refrain from partaking</p><p>-Depression or lethargic stage</p><p>-Avoidance of social functions, family, and friends. May become isolated and withdrawn</p><p>-Switching between periods of overeating and fasting</p><p></p><p>•Treatment for Disordered Eating:</p><p>Because of the severity and complexities of these conditions, a comprehensive and professional treatment team specializing in eating disorders is often fundamental in establishing healing and recovery.</p><p></p><p>Treatment plans are utilized in addressing the many concerns a man or woman may be facing in the restoration of their health and well-being and are often tailored to meet individual needs.</p><p></p><p>Treatment for an ED is usually comprised of one or more of the following and addressed with medical doctors, nutritionists, and therapists for complete care:</p><p></p><p>-Medical Care and Monitoring-The highest concern in the treatment of eating disorders is addressing any health issues that may have been a consequence of eating disordered behaviors.</p><p>-Nutrition: This would involve weight restoration and stabilization, guidance for normal eating, and the integration of an individualized meal plan.</p><p>-Therapy: Different forms of psychotherapy, such as individual, family, or group, can be helpful in addressing the underlying causes of eating disorders. Therapy is a fundamental piece of treatment because it affords an individual in recovery the opportunity to address and heal from traumatic life events and learn healthier coping skills and methods for expressing emotions, communicating and maintaining healthy relationships.</p><p>-Medications: Some medications may be effective in helping resolve mood or anxiety symptoms that can occur with an eating disorder or in reducing binge-eating and purging behavior.</p><p></p><br />

Both are form of eating disorders</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The similarity between Bulimia Nervosa and Binge-eating Disorder is that they are both forms of eating disorders. The correct answer is D. Both disorders involve a problematic relationship with food, which can lead to physical and psychological health consequences. While people with Bulimia Nervosa engage in binge-eating episodes and then try to compensate through purging behaviors (such as vomiting or using laxatives), people with Binge-eating Disorder also experience recurrent episodes of binge eating but without any compensatory behaviors. Both disorders involve a lack of control when eating food and can have serious physical and mental health consequences if left untreated.</p><p> -Jaz</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Anorexia nervous-often simply called anorexia — is an eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of weight. People with anorexia place a high value on controlling their weight and shape, using extreme efforts that tend to significantly interfere with their lives.</strong></p><p><strong>*SIGNS AND SYMPTOMPS OF ANOREXIA NERVOSA*</strong></p><p><strong>The physical signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa are related to starvation. Anorexia also includes emotional and behavioral issues involving an unrealistic perception of body weight and an extremely strong fear of gaining weight or becoming fat.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It may be difficult to notice signs and symptoms because what is considered a low body weight is different for each person, and some individuals may not appear extremely thin. Also, people with anorexia often disguise their thinness, eating habits or physical problems.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>*PREVENTION*</strong></p><p><strong>There's no guaranteed way to prevent anorexia nervosa. </strong></p><p><strong>2.bulimia nervosa- nervosa, commonly called bulimia, is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with bulimia may secretly binge — eating large amounts of food with a loss of control over the eating — and then purge, trying to get rid of the extra calories in an unhealthy way.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>*SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS*</strong></p><p><strong>Being preoccupied with your body shape and weight
</strong></p><p><strong>Living in fear of gaining weight
</strong></p><p><strong>Repeated episodes of eating abnormally large amounts of food in one sitting
</strong></p><p><strong>Feeling a loss of control during bingeing — like you can't stop eating or can't control what you eat
</strong></p><p><strong>Forcing yourself to vomit or exercising too much to keep from gaining weight after bingeing
</strong></p><p><strong>Using laxatives, diuretics or enemas after eating when they're not needed
</strong></p><p><strong>Fasting, restricting calories or avoiding certain foods between binges
</strong></p><p><strong>Using dietary supplements or herbal products excessively for weight loss</strong></p><p><strong>*PREVENTION*</strong></p><p><strong>Have regular, enjoyable family meals.
</strong></p><p><strong>Avoid talking about weight at home. Focus instead on having a healthy lifestyle.
</strong></p><p><strong>Discourage dieting, especially when it involves unhealthy weight-control behaviors, such as fasting, using weight-loss supplements or laxatives, or self-induced vomiting.</strong></p><p><strong>3.binge eating disorder-is a severe, life-threatening, and treatable eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food (often very quickly and to the point of discomfort</strong></p><p><strong>*SIGNS AND SYMPTOMPS*</strong></p><p><strong>Eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as over a two-hour period

With bulima nervosa, a person will binge eat uncontrollably and then follow that up with purging, intense exercise, or some other action to counterbalance the excessive eating. Binge eating is like bulima in terms of excessive food consumption, but there is no purging that follows it; this disorder carries a high risk of obesity. Anorexia nervosa is almost the opposite of binging or bulima—instead of eating vast amounts of food, someone with anorexia will hardly eat at all. The goal might be a slender figure, but anorexia often leads to malnourishment, dangerously low weight and damage to the organs. Two lesser-known dysfunctional eating behaviors include rumination disorder (food is regurgitated back into the mouth, without pain, and sometimes without intent) and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (lack of interest in eating for a variety of reasons, none of which have anything to do with weight).</p><p></p><p>There are signs to look for that could indicate an eating disorder. These include a strict, too-restrictive diet; avoiding meals; constant talk about being too fat; regular use of laxatives; avoiding social activities that may involve food; often eating large quantities of not-as-healthy foods such as sweets; loss of tooth enamel from vomiting; eating secretly or consuming more food at one time than is considered normal.  </p><p></p><p>Eating disorders are dangerous, complex disorders that arise from a variety of issues. One of the best ways to prevent or stop eating disorders in yourself and others is to adopt healthy attitudes and behaviors about body shape and weight. Here are eight tips from the National Eating Disorders Association on how to prevent eating disorders.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>thank me  later</p><p></p><br />
