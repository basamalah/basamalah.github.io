                        Senior High School
<p>
</p>Senior high school would be easy if we make it easy and it would also be hard at the same time if we make it challenging. <p></p><p>For me, it was a mix of fun, sad, easy and challenging all at the same time. This is the time wherein I am about to fully decide the path that I would want to go as I am about to begin the next chapter of my life. I had so much fun during my senior year because of the experiences that I have gained and the accomplishments I achieved. I also felt sad as I am about to go to a different chapter in my life and there would be chances that the people that I have been with would also go to different places and I might not see them anymore like I normally do every day in school. I even cried during the graduation day as some will be studying outside the country and we need to bid our goodbyes.  </p><p>
</p><p>I also find it easy compared to the years when I first started. I have great teachers that helped me become better and understand the importance of education. I was also challenged at the same time because I will finally be more independent and have to choose the course that I will be taking up in college. It was hard at first if you really do not know what you want.  </p><p>
</p><p>What I did, I ask my parents if they have any suggestions of the perfect course to take in college and even asked them how it is to be a college student. The reason why I did that is to prepare myself and somehow get ideas from their experience.  </p><p>
</p><p>Senior year was my favorite year above all – I experienced how great prom is, even get the chance to dance with my friends. Also, that was the first time that my parents allowed me to go out with my friends and had fun with the after party.
</p><p>
</p><p>Senior year made me become more confident with myself. I can say that I was able to develop and discovered my strengths and my weaknesses. It helped me more to know what I want to be in life and to know my purpose. Our school even provided us an event and invited different successful people to share their knowledge and give us tips on how to become successful in life. These individuals really helped us to be more determined and to strive hard to reach our goals.  </p><p>
</p><p>Life indeed is not that easy. The moment we get out and face the real world, we need to be strong and determined to be able to survive. There would be a lot of challenges that we never get to understand yet until we get to experience it ourselves. So, I am really grateful enough that I was able to gain all the knowledge and strength during my senior year and finally decided the path that I want to take in college.

There are schools, books, teachers, experiences, reflections, decisions, oneself, and innumerable more ways to learn. Everyone has their own favorite ways to learn, but to get a full education one needs a combination of them. Senior year evokes unique images for everyone; it is a time of change for everyone who has ever attended high school. Senior year has taught me so much.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Starting this semester, I was extremely intimidated by college and was nervous that I would not be able to do as well in college as I did in high school. I figured that the work would be much more difficult and that the teachers would not be as involved as they were in high school, which was true; but after the first moth or so, I began to really apply myself to my classes and now I feel like I have definitely adjusted well to the college atmosphere. Even though the whole “first semester” experience was not always easy or pleasent, I am very proud of myself to getting through it as well as I did and I am determined to improve next semester. My “frist semester experience” was a huge wake-up call for me. It made me realize that I can no longer rely on my teachers or my mother or my friends anymore and that it was time for me to be independent and handle things on my own. These past couple of months have included some of the most stressful experiences of my life, but they have made me mature and grow up much quicker than I ever imagined I would have. Although this semester has been rough, I would not have wanted it…show more content…</p><p>As of recently, I’ve been putting all of my deadlines and important dates regarding my classes into my calender so that I can organize my time better. I’ve also been trying to set more time aside for studying instead of just trying to always cram information the night before. Studying has always been especially diffuclt for me because I get distracted so easily, but now I am trying to create study sheets and I use index cards to keep myself more focused when studying. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Junior High School and Senior High School are two distinct educational levels in the Philippine education system. Both have their unique features and offer different opportunities for students. In this essay, we will discuss the comparison and contrast of Junior High School and Senior High School.</p><p></p><p>Junior High School or JHS is composed of grades 7 to 10, while Senior High School or SHS is composed of grades 11 to 12. The main goal of JHS is to provide a basic education foundation for students, while SHS aims to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge for their chosen career paths. One of the significant differences between JHS and SHS is the curriculum. JHS follows the K-12 curriculum, which includes general education subjects such as Math, Science, English, and Social Studies. Meanwhile, SHS offers specialized tracks such as Academic, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL), Sports, and Arts and Design. The tracks provide students with a more focused education that will help them prepare for their future careers.</p><p></p><p>Another difference between JHS and SHS is the length of time spent in school. JHS has a total of four years, while SHS only has two years. In JHS, students spend more time in general education subjects. In contrast, in SHS, students spend more time in specialized subjects and practical training. The reduced time in SHS allows students to graduate early and pursue higher education or enter the workforce earlier than JHS students.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, JHS students are required to take the National Achievement Test (NAT) to measure their academic proficiency, while SHS students are required to take the Philippine Educational Placement Test (PEPT) and Career Assessment Examination (CAE). These tests are essential for students to identify their strengths and weaknesses and choose the appropriate career track that suits their interests.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the teaching methods used in JHS and SHS are different. In JHS, the teaching approach is more theoretical, while in SHS, it is more practical. SHS students undergo On-The-Job-Training (OJT) or apprenticeships, giving them hands-on experience in their chosen fields.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, JHS and SHS have significant differences in their curriculum, length of time spent in school, assessments, teaching methods, and overall goals. JHS aims to provide students with a general education foundation, while SHS focuses on providing specialized education to prepare students for their future careers. Regardless of these differences, both JHS and SHS play essential roles in the Philippine education system, providing students with a solid foundation for their future.</p><br />

                            20. abolition of the senior high school of ph essay​</h2><br />
                        In support of abolishing the senior high school program in the Philippines, as it is an important component of the country's educational system. The senior high school program was established as part of the K-12 program, which aims to provide students with a quality education that is aligned with international standards and prepares them for college and the workforce.<br /><br />The senior high school program is designed to provide students with additional years of education that focus on developing their skills and knowledge in various fields, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), humanities and social sciences, and technical-vocational education and training (TVET). It also offers specialized tracks that cater to the interests and career aspirations of students, such as the academic track, the arts and design track, the sports track, and the TVET track.<br /><br />Abolishing the senior high school program would deprive students of the opportunity to pursue their interests and career goals, and limit their options for further education and employment. It would also have a negative impact on the country's workforce and economic growth, as employers require highly skilled and trained workers to compete in the global market.<br /><br />Furthermore, the senior high school program provides students with a holistic education that prepares them not only for academic success but also for personal and social development. It equips them with essential life skills, such as critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity, that are important for success in any field.<br /><br />Overall, the senior high school program is an important component of the Philippines' educational system, and abolishing it would have serious consequences for the country's future. Instead of calling for its abolishment, efforts should be made to improve and strengthen the program to ensure that it is more responsive to the needs of students and the demands of the 21st century.<br />This text is generated by Ask AI!

                        Being a Senior in high school can be a very difficult time for some people, you aren’t quite an adult, yet you don’t get all the privileges and adult does. Fighting with your parents about certain topics can lead to constantly getting the line “back in my day”. This can usually result in the teen throwing a fit saying that their parents’ don’t “get it”. Take a look back and you realize that they too went through the same things as you, but some things have changed from the 1980’s to now. Just the factor of time has changed the senior experience greatly since the 1980’s to 2016. Things like new technology, social media, and just the fact of it being a different time in our society, but there will always be some similarities because teenagers<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Hope It Helps<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Credits to:cram.com<br />

                        <p>Once you have well-defined constructs that you would like to measure, your question items should elicit responses that are related to the construct. For example, you may want to assess your clients' motivation to participate in certain program activities. You would first generate a list of questionnaire items that measure attitudes and beliefs as well as behaviors commonly associated with high or low motivation. Avoid "double-barreled" questions like, "My clients are dedicated and punctual."</p><p></p><p>Taking some time at the beginning of the period to outline your essay is a must. According to Livingston, "In order to write a successful essay, you must organize your thoughts." It may seem obvious, and that's because it is. If you don't make an outline for your essay, you'll likely start strong before going off topic or losing focus on the prompt. Either on paper or in your head, outline your stance on the prompt and several points you want to touch on.</p><p> </p>Teachers are those who make child knowledgeable and cultured. A teacher is a beautiful gift given by god because god is a creator of the whole world and a teacher is a creator of a whole nation. A teacher is such an important creature in the life of a student, who through his knowledge, patience and love gives a strong shape to student’s whole life. A teacher has many qualities, they are efficient in their student’s life successful in every aspect. A teacher is very intelligent. They know how the mind of students get concentrated in studies. During teaching, a teacher uses creativity so that student can concentrate in studies. They are a repository of knowledge and has patience and confidence to take responsibility for the future of the student. They only want to see their students successful and happy. Teachers are very prestigious people in the society, who through their magic of education, take the responsibilities of raising the lifestyle and mind level of the common people. Parents expect a lot from teachers. The role of teacher varies from class to games. A teacher is an important creature in everyone’s life who appears to do different things in our life.<br /><br />Importance of Teacher<br /><br />A teacher has an important place not only in student life but also in every field. They have all qualities which they distribute in their student. They know that not everyone has the same ability to receive, so a teacher observes all the abilities of each of their students and in the same way, they teach children. A teacher is a great listener of knowledge, prosperity and light, from which we can benefit greatly throughout our life. Every teacher helps their students in choosing their path. Teacher is a one who teaches their students how to respect elders. They tell their student the difference between respect and insult and many more. A teacher equips his/her student with knowledge, skills and positive behaviour, due to which the student never feels lost.<br /><br />He makes them aware of how to use time and the restriction of time. A good teacher makes a good impression on his student. When any student makes a mistake, the teacher teaches them a lesson and also makes them realize their mistake. They teach us to wear clean clothes, eat healthy food, stay away from the wrong food, take care of parents, treat others well and helps us in understanding the importance of completing work.<br /><br />Children’s future and present both are made by the teacher. He also enhances a good society by creating a good student throughout his life. Only a teacher knows what kind of association his student lives in and what kind of association he holds.<br /><br />Hard Work to be a Teacher<br /><br />It takes a lot of hard work to be a good teacher. First of all, always respect the elders and also obey them. Concentration should be increased toward the society and education. To be a teacher good one have a sense of unity in the heart, do not discriminate against anyone, everyone should be seen with a glance. They always encourage students, they never criticize their students. Develops a good interpersonal relationship with a student. One should always tell good things to their younger ones and always treat the classmate well, always take inspiration from the teacher.<br /><br />The teacher has a huge contribution to our life. No one can developmentally, socially and intellectually in their life without a teacher. Many teacher slap students, many give punishment but at the end, the teacher is never bad. It only depends on the way they teach, which is different for everyone and this creates a different image in the student’s mind. They do whatever just to make our future bright.<br /><br />On every year, some teachers get honoured. Teachers’ day is celebrated every year on 5 September in honour of teachers. On this day a special ceremony takes place in the school, in which students participate enthusiastically. Nation always honours all those teachers who help in eradicating ignorance of darkness. A teacher is an ocean of knowledge, we should keep acquiring knowledge on a subject as long as possible.<br />
