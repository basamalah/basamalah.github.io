                                            Case Analysis: Read the following account and answer the questions following:	Luke is a professional with a degree in Computer Engineering from a prestigious University. He works in a multinational manufacturing company; earns a salary three times that of his friends. In his mid 30s Luke has had several relationships but has not settled yet for marriage. He never wanted to commit himself to any woman as he often would decide to get out of the relationship once he felt that the other party would ask for a longer and more stable commitment. When questioned by his family and friends, Luke would say that he is not ready for a change in his lifestyle and he thinks that emotionally, financially and psychologically he does not have the capacity to be a family man and to raise children. Point to ponder: Why does  Luke think that he is not ready to face the life of a family man despite his achievements and abilities? Answer the question by stating applicable philosophical theories in life. Expound your answer. (30pts.)Discuss. Of the various philosophies presented in the lesson, choose one.  Using the guide statements  below,   expound on that  specific philosophy relating to the understanding of the ‘self’.  (20pts).Asserting that things happen for a reason.Believing that things can be done if you want to. ​</a>

                            4. Case Analysis: Read the following account and answer the questions following:	Luke is a professional with a degree in Computer Engineering from a prestigious University. He works in a multinational manufacturing company; earns a salary three times that of his friends. In his mid 30s Luke has had several relationships but has not settled yet for marriage. He never wanted to commit himself to any woman as he often would decide to get out of the relationship once he felt that the other party would ask for a longer and more stable commitment. When questioned by his family and friends, Luke would say that he is not ready for a change in his lifestyle and he thinks that emotionally, financially and psychologically he does not have the capacity to be a family man and to raise children. Point to ponder: Why does  Luke think that he is not ready to face the life of a family man despite his achievements and abilities? Answer the question by stating applicable philosophical theories in life. Expound your answer. (30pts.)Discuss. Of the various philosophies presented in the lesson, choose one.  Using the guide statements  below,   expound on that  specific philosophy relating to the understanding of the ‘self’.  (20pts).Asserting that things happen for a reason.Believing that things can be done if you want to. ​</h2><br />

In Metacognitive Teaching, learners are trained to become aware of and exert control over their own learning vy using metacognitive processes . 3. In Inquiry Teaching learners are confronted with a puzzling situation and are led to enter into investigative work to solve the problem . 4. In Expository Strategies or Direct Instruction, the Desired Outcomes are development and formulation of concept , principles, attitudes and values. 5. In Exploratory Strategies or Guided Instruction, the Learning Environments are similar . 6. The three fundamental laws of learning by the Association Theory are the law of readiness, law of exercise and law of effect. 7. The law of exercise is where learning is strenthened if it results in satisfaction, but is weakened if it leads to vexation or annoyance. 8. Stimulus Response (SR) or Association Theory of learning states that in every stimulus there is a corresponding response 9. The factors affecting individual differences are age differences and personal adjustments , sex differences, family and community background , physical conditions , emotional response and attitudes ( EQ), and mental abilities and specific aptitudes (IQ) . 10.
