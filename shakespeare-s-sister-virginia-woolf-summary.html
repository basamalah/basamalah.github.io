Even at a very young age, women were already made to do household chores instead ofreading Horace or Virgil and creating imagined worlds.4. The fictional Judith Shakespeare would have escaped her childhood home to fulfil a burningdesire to become a writer5.

Woolf sheds light on the reality of women’s life during this time and illustrates the effects of social structures on the creative spirit of women. In the society they lived in, women were halted to explore and fulfill their talent the same way men were able to, due to the gender role conventions that prevailed during this era. Through a theoretical setting in which it is it is imagined that William Shakespeare had a sister (Judith), Virginia Woolf personifies women during the sixteenth century in order to reflect the hardships they had to overcome as aspiring writers. </p><p>The author’s main purpose for…</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>It's not the whole answer;(</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Virginia Woolf’s short story “The New Dress” was written in 1924 while she was writing the novel Mrs. Dalloway, published in 1925. Critics have entertained the possibility that the story may originally have been a chapter of the novel because some of the same characters and events appear in both works. The story was published in the May 1927 issue of the monthly New York magazine the Forum. In the story, a deeply insecure and painfully self-conscious guest at a party is convinced that she is the target of mockery.
</p><p>
</p><p>Leonard Woolf later republished “The New Dress” in the collection A Haunted House in 1944, three years after Virginia Woolf’s death. It was republished in 1973 in the collection Mrs. Dalloway’s Party, with other stories by Woolf that focus on the guests and events of the day leading up to Clarissa Dalloway’s party.

</p><p>Author Biography
</p><p>Virginia Woolf was born Adeline Virginia Stephen in London on January 25, 1882, the third of four children of Julia Duckworth and Sir Leslie Stephen, a noted historian and biographer. As a child, Woolf received no formal education but made use of her father’s library and literary friendships to educate herself. After her mother’s death in 1895, Woolf experienced a nervous breakdown, the first in a series of four debilitating emotional traumas. When her father died nine years later, Woolf had her second mental breakdown. Upon her recovery, she moved with her sister, Vanessa, and her brothers, Thoby and Adrian, to the Bloomsbury district of London.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            3. What is the rising action of  the new dress by Virginia Woolf</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The New Dress” is a short story by English author Virginia Woolf. It was written in 1924 and published in the New York’s The Forum magazine in 1927. Written while Woolf was in the process of penning her famous novel Mrs. Dalloway, the two share similar events and characters, leading people to believe that “The New Dress” may have been an excised chapter from the book.</p><p></p><p>Told in a stream-of-consciousness narrative, the story focuses on Mabel Waring, who feels deeply self-conscious and insecure as she attends a party hosted by Clarissa Dalloway. Mabel wears a new, although old-fashioned, dress that she has taken great care to make sure is perfect—but in the end, it still isn’t quite right. Exploring social conventions, fashion, and the pressure on women to be perfect, “The New Dress” was later collected in two anthologies of Woolf’s work: A Haunted House and Other Short Stories (1944) and Mrs. Dalloway’s Party (1973).</p><p></p><p>As Mabel Waring arrives at Clarissa Dalloway’s party, she is filled with feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. These feelings are set off by worries that her new dress is not appropriate for the occasion. After greeting the hostess, she goes to look at herself in a mirror, immediately deciding that it’s not right. She imagines the other guests staring at her, exclaiming, “What a fright she looks! What a hideous new dress!”She berates herself for trying to appear original. She couldn’t afford a new dress in the latest fashion, so she had a yellow silk dress made from an older pattern. She continues to condemn herself, escalating to self-torture with obsessive thoughts of her own foolishness. She tells herself that she deserves to be chastised by her fellow partygoers, calling the new dress a horror and idiotically old-fashioned. Rose Shaw, a stylishly dressed fellow partygoer, approaches Mabel and tells her the dress is perfectly charming, but Mabel is sure she is being mocked.</p><p></p><p>Mabel tries to think of some way “to annul this pain, to make this agony endurable.” She continues to describe her situation in agonized terms, giving the reader the impression that she might not be mentally stable. She comes off as clearly shy and socially unskilled, which leads to the extreme anxiety she endures in social settings.</p><p></p><p>Mabel tries to envision the partygoers as flies trying to crawl all over the edges of a saucer, all alike and swarming like insects. However, she can’t bring herself to see the others in this fashion. She tells a male guest that she feels like “some dowdy, decrepit, horribly dingy old fly.” He hastily compliments her in an insincere manner, and Mabel is horrified to realize he must have interpreted her comment as fishing for him to disagree with and correct her.She tries to think back to how happy and comfortable she felt at the dressmaker’s, as the kind Miss Milan pinned her hem, asked for her measurements, and tended to her pet canary. However, Mabel is snapped out of these pleasant thoughts by the reality of the party around her. She berates herself for caring about what others think of her, and this devolves into Mabel condemning her “odious, weak, vacillating character.”</p><p></p><p>Mabel recalls growing up in her unremarkable family and her dreams of romance and adventure in far-away lands. She thinks about her reality, including her marriage to a man with a “safe, permanent underling’s job.” She thinks back to special, isolated moments in her life, which she characterizes as “delicious” and “divine.” These were the only moments when she felt truly happy and fulfilled, connected with all the earth and everything in it, or as she puts it, “on the crest of a wave.”</p><p></p><p>She wonders if these moments will become more and more infrequent as she gets older, and decides she wants to find a way to be happy. She decides to pursue self-improvement and transformation through “some wonderful, helpful, astonishing book,” or maybe an inspirational public speaker. Having talked herself out of her internal crisis, she gets up to leave the party. Before she goes, she approaches Mrs. Dalloway, assuring the hostess that she enjoyed herself at the party.Virginia Woolf was considered one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century and a pioneer of the stream-of-consciousness style. A prolific author, she wrote nine novels during her lifetime, as well as six collections of short stories (four published after her death), three biographies, a comedy for the stage, and a large collection of nonfiction, essays, translations, and biographies. She’s regarded as one of the most influential writers of the early feminist tradition and has influenced many future works, most famously the acclaimed 1962 play Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and the 1998 novel and its 2002 Oscar-winning film adaptation The Hours (focusing on three generations of women influenced by Mrs. Dalloway).</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> </p><p>THAT'S  MY ANSWER ON YOUR QUESTION</p><br />

It's 1897. Eight-year-old Virginia O'Hanlon has always loved Christmas. Until the day her classmates bring up the age-old question: "Is there a Santa Claus?" Not sure what to believe, Virginia ventures into the city to find out for herself. Along the way she consults some unusual characters: a scraggly Santa ringing a bell, an excitable librarian with a shelf full of Christmas books, and her quirky doctor father. Unable to find the answers she's looking for, Virginia writes to The New York Sun newspaper. Her letter makes its way to the desk of curmudgeonly editor Francis Church, who has better things to do than respond to a little girl's questions. But through Virginia's determination (and a little help from a scraggly Santa) Mr. Church is persuaded to write his answer...an answer that becomes the most famous newspaper editorial of all time.</p><br />
