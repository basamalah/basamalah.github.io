                                            Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</a>

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</a>

                                            A. Nestled among the peaks of eastern Hongkong, a new man- made mountain is emerging. While plans to expand some sites are being proposed and a controversial mega-incinerator project remains a possibility, focus in the city is turning to how to reduce the amount of waste it produces. The local government has created a task force to address the issue of food waste and has set a 10% reduction target by 2016. Globally, only around 3% of food waste is recycle.B. Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I have never been away from my homeland, the Philippines. First of all, the Philippines has a total land area of about 300 000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514 000 square kilometers.

                                            The discovery of a new human species in the Philippines is prompting a reevaluationof human evolution and historyAn international team of archaeologists, including researchers from the University ofthe Philippines, have announced the discovery of the new species, Homo luzonensis, basedon bones and teeth found in Callao Cave located in Penablanca town, Cagayan province innorthern Luzon that date back over 50,000 yearsIn a paper published on April 10 in the journal Nature, the researchers said they hadfound the remains of three individualswith physical features common to modern and earlyhumans but in an altogether unique combination. This prompted the researchers to designatethe find as a completely new species. Callao Cave has proven to be a treasure trove of humanremains.In 2007, University of the Philippines archaeologist Dr. Armand Mijares-who also co-led the Nature paper-unearthed a metatarsal foot bone that dated back some 67,000 years.While undoubtedly human, the single bone was not enough to ascertain what speciesof hominin it belonged to. This prompted Mijares and other archaeologists to continue diggingin the Callao Caves in search for more remains.Their efforts were met with success when further excavations in 2011 and 2017yielded hand and foot bones, as well as teeth.A comparison of the physical characteristics of these fossils with the bones and teethof other hominin species showed that they were distinctively different from other knownhuman species including our own, Homo sapiens, and a cousin species that lived in Indonesiaat around the same time, Homo floresiensis.Although the H. luzonensis fossils are the oldest known human remains in thePhilippines to date, there is indirect evidence that human habitation of the islands dates backmuch farther into the past: in 2018, a separate team of Filipino and French researchers hadfound stone tools and a butchered rhinoceros carcass-no actual hominin remains werefoundin a former flood plain in Kalinga province, Luzon, dating back some 700,000 years.The discovery of the Kalinga fossils pushed back the habitation of the Philippineislands by over 600,000 years. The authors of the Nature paper suggest that these may havebeen from H. luzonensis,The discovery of H. luzonensis prompts a reevaluation of current ideas about howhumans evolved and spread across the world, and the Philippines' place in the grand storyof humanity. Among other questions that need to be resolved are what H. luzonensis' relationship is with other human species, and how these species managed to set foot in Luzon in thefirst place.Exactly how are they related to us? Did they travel by boat? Unfortunately, the currentlack of genetic and archaeological evidence leaves those questions hanging for now.The team that announced the discovery of H. luzonensis was co-led by Dr. FlorentDétroit of the French National Museum of Natural History and included researchers from theNational Museum of the Philippines, Université de Poiters, Université Toulouse III PaulSabatier, Université de Bordeaux, Griffith University and Australian National University,BAP, GMA NewsPamprosesong Tanong:1.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.

                            4. Opinion 1: Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of the Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known super power not through force of arms, but by engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal's decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how the rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair resolution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in the Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right; Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratlys islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international law. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its cases against China at the United Nations, the Chines government has dismissed the proceeding and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China's utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines? The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from 26​</h2><br />

                            8. Opinion 1:Filipinos should rejoice that the UN Tribunal has upheld their right to the islands and waters of Spratlys. It is but right that the Philippines has gained this victory over a known superpower not through force of arms , but engaging the global community and appealing to the rule of law. The Tribunal’s decision both upholds the UNCLOS as the primary basis for determining matters related to territorial waters and provides nations an example of how rule of law and due process, when properly observed, can bring about a fair solution. With this victory, the Philippines can now confidently face China in negotiating the rights to the territorial waters in Spratlys. Armed with the conviction that the Filipino people and its government are in the right, Filipino negotiators will now be able to ask for more equitable terms regarding access to and use of resources in the disputed area. International opinion can also be used to convince China to scale back on its activities in the Spratly islands, and this hopefully will put a stop to the construction of facilities and their increasing military presence in the disputed islands. The decision has made diplomacy the only option to resolve the issue regarding the Spratlys. The region and the world will not benefit if the Philippines and China, along with the other claimant countries it, abandon dialogue and resort to force to push their respective claims. With the support of its international partners, the Philippines can now justly assert its rights and enjoin all involved parties to uphold respect for international. Opinion 2: China will never recognize the UN Tribunal decision and will continue its activities in the disputed Spratly islands. Ever since the Philippines filed its case against China at the United Nations, the Chinese government has dismissed the proceedings and has not participated in any of the hearings of the Tribunal. This shows China’s utter disregard for international rule of law and its lack of respect for the UNCLOS, a document to which China is a signing party. The military and economic ambitions of C more China will continue to fuel its desire to occupy more territory. If China does not give way despite the decision and the overwhelming international pressure, what will stop it from occupying islands that actually belong to the Philippines?  The continued presence of Chinese forces in the islands is a disaster waiting to happen. Given that they have control over many islands and have been harassing Filipino fishermen who go into its nearby waters, what will stop the Chinese from using destructive and deadly force on any ship that dares to trespass in their socalled territories? Nothing short of a war will convince China that its territorial ambitions have already exceeded the tolerance of the world. ​What are the merits of the opinions given?</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>west Philippine sea for me is one of the most important issue we have,yet no one bother to address it. Because,maybe the  pandemic we face right now is enough for us to forget about the west Philippine issue. If i were to reckon about it i think our president is too threatened since china is a known rich country,and we all fully know that,if we'll compare our soldiers armours to theirs we're nothing but a peck of dust they can easily blow. But we can't just live having the fear ingrained to us. We have to fight back. Winning may be impossible but war isn't always the solution,as said to the (PCA) and (UNCLOS) we have our sovereign right over WPS.</p><p>the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: José Rizal</strong></p><p><strong>Philippine National Hero and Ophthalmologist</strong></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p><strong>José Rizal (1861-1896) is one of the most revered figures in Philippine history. He was a multifaceted intellectual and a political activist, best known for his political writings that inspired the Philippine revolution and ultimately led to his execution by the Spanish colonizers. Rizal was also a physician who trained in ophthalmology under 2 prominent European ophthalmologists, Louis de Wecker and Otto Becker.</strong></p><p><strong>Rizal has become a symbol of the Philippine struggle for independence, and he is known there as a national hero. December 30, the date of Rizal's execution in 1896, is celebrated as a national holiday in the Philippines. Jose Rizal College was dedicated to his honor in Manila in 1919. There are commemorative monuments to Rizal in Manila near the site of his execution in Luneta Park, in his hometown, and most Filipino towns, in Heidelberg, and Chicago. His portrait appears on the Filipino 2-peso bill. The region around Manila, including his hometown of Calamba, was designated a province and named Rizal. His novels are required reading for Filipino high school students. Jose Rizal can perhaps be best summarized using his own words from the poem he wrote from his cell the night before his execution. One of the last stanzas of "Ultimo Adios" (Final Farewell) shows his selfless devotion to his country, his loyalty to his family, his deep spirituality despite criticism of the church, and his artistic grace.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            14. I. How does the experience of Mang Rene mirror the sad plight of Philippine agriculture in particular and reflect the conditions of the national economy in general with reference to Globalization. 2.	If you will be able to talk to Mang Rene, how are you going to explain to him (in the simplest way possible) the workings of the GATT- WTO, what it stands for and how Globalization can positively affect him? 3.	Research on the advantages and disadvantages of the GATT, be able to construct a matrix showing which of these has directly impacted the Philippines. Be able to weigh your findings and assess whether the GATT WTO has indeed been instrumental for us or not in our quest for development.​</h2><br />
                        1. Mang Rene's experience mirrors the struggle of Philippine agriculture in particular and the state of the national economy in general in relation to globalization.<p>Agriculture is a vital component of the Philippine economy. It employs approximately 40 percent of Filipino employees and contributes 20 percent on average to the Gross Domestic Product. This output is mostly the result of agribusiness, which accounts for around 70% of the overall agricultural output (CIDA-LGSP, 2003). Mang Rene's experience demonstrates, however, that the Philippine agriculture sector is diminishing in the current environment. </p><p></p><p>According to Nations Encyclopedia (2020), the rapid conversion of agricultural land into golf courses, residential subdivisions, and industrial parks or resorts is one of the most significant issues facing the agricultural industry. In 1993, the nation was losing 2,300 hectares of irrigated rice fields annually. Small landowners find it more beneficial to sell their land to developers in exchange for cash, as they lack the funds necessary to purchase seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, and pay for employing laborers to cultivate and harvest crops. With these urgent issues and the natural disaster that Mang Rene experienced, it can be concluded that despite the reported progress in the national economy, the underprivileged Filipinos are preventing it from being realized. Also, these individuals did not experience the advantages of economic globalization.</p><p></p>2. If I were allowed to speak with Mang Rene, I explain to him (in the simplest terms possible) how GATT-WTO operates, what it stands for, and how Globalization might benefit him.<p>The goal of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was to reduce or eliminate trade obstacles such as tariffs and quotas in order to facilitate international trade. In contrast, the World Trade Institution (WTO) is an organization dedicated to trading liberalization. It is a platform where trade agreements are negotiated. It is a forum for resolving trade disputes. It administers a set of trade regulations. The WTO is essentially a forum where member states attempt to resolve the trade issues they face with one another. </p><p></p><p>Members of the WTO operate a non-discriminatory trading system that outlines their rights and responsibilities. Each member is assured that its exports will be handled fairly and uniformly in the markets of other members. Each agrees to do the same for imports into their own markets. The framework also provides developing economies with considerable implementation flexibility. Members of the <strong>World Trade Organization (WTO) </strong>have taken initiatives to reform the agriculture sector and eliminate the subsidies and high commerce barriers that distort agricultural trade. The ultimate objective is to build a more equitable trade system that will expand farmers' access to markets and enhance their standard of living.</p><p></p>3. You can see the advantages and disadvantages of the GATT in the picture below.<p>The dominant economic worldview recognizes<strong> international trade </strong>liberalization as a way to progress. The Agreement on Agriculture that has been implemented under the authority of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is the single most significant step ever taken in this direction. The Philippines' GATT advantages and disadvantages are presented in the matrix below.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the <strong>GATT-WTO Agreement</strong> on Agriculture has a favorable influence on the agricultural economy of the Philippines. The year-on-year decline in tariffs demonstrated that developing nations, such as the Philippines, are obligated to adhere to the policy of not increasing tariffs, even if farmers suffer significant sales deficits, particularly in export markets. Although the primary objective of the agreement is to involve the developing country in export trades, the primary objective is not met because small-scale farmers in the Philippines are unable to export rice due to a lack of government subsidies.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about WTO here: https://brainly.ph/question/26438245</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</h2><br />

Directions: Read and analyze each question. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. 1. North Korean President Kim Jon-un ordered killing the first people who got infected by COVID-19 in North Korea his drastic action depicts and ideology of Totalitarianism. Explain. 2. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand has been praised for her leadership style during the pandemic countries led by women seem to be particularly successful in fighting the coronavirus. How do you see world female leaders handle the pandemic more efficient than male leaders? Explain and relate to feminism. 3. Philippines among other nation suffers the effect of COVID19 Pandemic those in the low- and middle-income earners were greatly affected, how do Filipino cope with this pandemic to show our nationalism? Explain and cite an example.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The ideology of totalitarianism is characterized by a single party rule, state control of the economy, and the use of force and propaganda to maintain power. Kim Jon-un's order to kill the first people who got infected with COVID-19 in North Korea exemplifies this ideology because it shows a willingness to use extreme and violent measures to maintain control over the population, even at the cost of human lives.</p><p></p><p>Women leaders have been successful in handling the pandemic because they tend to prioritize the well-being of their citizens over political considerations. They are more collaborative and empathetic, and they are often better at communicating with the public. These qualities are often associated with feminism, which emphasizes the importance of social justice and equality. Women leaders also tend to be more open to different perspectives and less hierarchical in their decision-making, which can lead to more effective policies and greater trust in government.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos have coped with the pandemic by showing resilience and solidarity. Many have volunteered to help those in need, such as by distributing food or providing medical care. The community spirit that has emerged during the pandemic reflects a strong sense of nationalism, where people are willing to help each other and work together to overcome challenges. For example, the Bayanihan E-Konsulta program allows people to consult with doctors online for free, helping to provide medical assistance to those who cannot afford it. This program shows how Filipinos are using technology and innovation to respond to the challenges of the pandemic while demonstrating their patriotism and commitment to the common good.</p><br />

                            25. The discovery of a new human species in the Philippines is prompting a reevaluationof human evolution and historyAn international team of archaeologists, including researchers from the University ofthe Philippines, have announced the discovery of the new species, Homo luzonensis, basedon bones and teeth found in Callao Cave located in Penablanca town, Cagayan province innorthern Luzon that date back over 50,000 yearsIn a paper published on April 10 in the journal Nature, the researchers said they hadfound the remains of three individualswith physical features common to modern and earlyhumans but in an altogether unique combination. This prompted the researchers to designatethe find as a completely new species. Callao Cave has proven to be a treasure trove of humanremains.In 2007, University of the Philippines archaeologist Dr. Armand Mijares-who also co-led the Nature paper-unearthed a metatarsal foot bone that dated back some 67,000 years.While undoubtedly human, the single bone was not enough to ascertain what speciesof hominin it belonged to. This prompted Mijares and other archaeologists to continue diggingin the Callao Caves in search for more remains.Their efforts were met with success when further excavations in 2011 and 2017yielded hand and foot bones, as well as teeth.A comparison of the physical characteristics of these fossils with the bones and teethof other hominin species showed that they were distinctively different from other knownhuman species including our own, Homo sapiens, and a cousin species that lived in Indonesiaat around the same time, Homo floresiensis.Although the H. luzonensis fossils are the oldest known human remains in thePhilippines to date, there is indirect evidence that human habitation of the islands dates backmuch farther into the past: in 2018, a separate team of Filipino and French researchers hadfound stone tools and a butchered rhinoceros carcass-no actual hominin remains werefoundin a former flood plain in Kalinga province, Luzon, dating back some 700,000 years.The discovery of the Kalinga fossils pushed back the habitation of the Philippineislands by over 600,000 years. The authors of the Nature paper suggest that these may havebeen from H. luzonensis,The discovery of H. luzonensis prompts a reevaluation of current ideas about howhumans evolved and spread across the world, and the Philippines' place in the grand storyof humanity. Among other questions that need to be resolved are what H. luzonensis' relationship is with other human species, and how these species managed to set foot in Luzon in thefirst place.Exactly how are they related to us? Did they travel by boat? Unfortunately, the currentlack of genetic and archaeological evidence leaves those questions hanging for now.The team that announced the discovery of H. luzonensis was co-led by Dr. FlorentDétroit of the French National Museum of Natural History and included researchers from theNational Museum of the Philippines, Université de Poiters, Université Toulouse III PaulSabatier, Université de Bordeaux, Griffith University and Australian National University,BAP, GMA NewsPamprosesong Tanong:1.

Front liners emulates Jose Rizal’s self-sacrifice
Christina Mendez (The Philippine Star)June 20, 2020 - 12:00am
MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang officials compared thousands of Filipino health workers and other frontline workers engaged in addressing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) here and abroad to the heroism of Dr. Jose Rizal, whose 159th birth anniversary was marked yesterday.
Presidential Communications Operations Office chief Secretary Martin Andanar and presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. talked about how Rizal’s patriotism and self-sacrifice are reflected in the sacrifices of Filipino health workers, medical doctors and other frontliners in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Andanar noted how Rizal strongly displayed nationalism and patriotism throughout his life, which “greatly contributed to our forefathers’ pursuit of justice, freedom and independence against our colonizers.”
“Today, as we face the threat of an unseen enemy in this pandemic... like Dr. Jose Rizal, may we utilize our intelligence in our fight against COVID-19 and may we find the strength of heart to continue on our path to recovery,” Andanar said. He urged the Filipino people to continue to be inspired by the legacy left by the country’s national hero, citing his brilliance, compassion, bravery, peaceful resistance and selfless and wholehearted service to the country.
For Roque, Rizal’s life is “a testament of how a single person’s deep love for his country could spark the reawakening of our forefathers’ desire for freedom and change.”
The occasion reminds the nation of Rizal’s young life, dedicated to service, which rings a bell in these challenging times. “We are proud to see today modern-day heroes – our courageous front liners – who rise up to the challenge and serve as beacons of hope to a people weary and fearful of the present global health scare,” Roque said. Roque rallied the youth to be inspired by Rizal’s way of life to help steer the country to greater heights.
