I need it like 10 mins if can pls.Once, when I wander into your thoughtsLike a foggy shape in the distanceWhose face you don't recognize,But whom you feel close, nevertheless...When, for a brief moment, your eyesReflect memories and our dreams,Reminding you of a time long gone,I which you had a dream...When a song, old and so familiar,Takes you back to a small town,To a bridge you used to call yours,But no longer remember its name...When you suddenly make a sighFilled with unexplainable sorrowThat overwhelms you, squeezing your heartAnd you don’t know why…Then… smile…For no reason, no motive…Just like that…Give me the last smile,Once more, for good-bye…Let me go away happy,Carrying your face in my heart and my eyes…Let me go awayLike I’ve always been…Forever yours…​</a>

excerpts. Write your answers in your notebook.
1. Sam and Bella were at Perez Park sitting on a bench together. Neither of them
was smiling. After a long period of silence, Sam said, “This isn’t going to work.
I mean, you’re an introvert person and I’m an extrovert person.” Bella
nodded. A tear rolled her face. Sam went on, “If we got married and live
together, what kind of activities could we do that we will both enjoy?
Somebody’s going to be unhappy.” Bella began sobbing and said, “Okay,
let’s just end it now. Have fun with your life.” She jumped off the bench and
ran into the streets.

3. Sheryl looked across the field. She didn’t see anything concerning. She
wondered why Kristine called out like that. Kristine turned to her. The ghost that
Kristine had just seen was gone. Now, she felt crazy. “You have to believe me,
Sheryl.” It was just here,” said Kristine. Sheryl frowned at her in disbelief. “What
was just here, Kristine,” she asked. Sheryl was angry with Kristine for disturbing
her sleep for no apparent reason.

5. Samuelle looked at the field. She was thinking about the game. They could
have won. She could have won the game for them. All she needed to do was
catch the ball, but she didn’t. She dropped it. Her coach talked to her.
“Samuelle, we had a great season. Nobody’s perfect. Look at me,” he said.
Samuelle smiled at the coach, but she couldn’t forgive herself so easily.

The best way to capture the interest of the audience is to take advantage of the right <strong>communicative strategy</strong> whenever we give a talk.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Seven Communicative Strategies:</strong></p><strong>Nomination Strategy</strong><strong><br /></strong>When someone is presenting a particular topic, or saying what he thinks is relevant, he is using the <strong>nomination strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Restriction</strong><strong><br /></strong>With the support of enough set of categories that are to be constrained by a particular response or reaction, someone is using a <strong>restriction strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Turn-taking</strong><strong><br /></strong>A person knows when to speak or respond because he knows when is the right time to speak or his turn. That uis when someone applies the <strong>turn-taking strategy.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Topic control</strong><strong><br /></strong>Someone is using the <strong>topic control strategy</strong> by making sure that the interaction is ongoing. The use of topic control strategy requires techniques to keep the <strong>conversation going.</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Topic shifting</strong><strong><br /></strong>The process of <strong>topic shifting</strong> is continuing a communication or interaction by asking relevant questions or elaborating what someone said.<br /><strong>Repair</strong><strong><br /></strong>When the communication is not in good shape, <strong>a repair strategy </strong>is being done to overcome communication breakdown.<br /><strong>Termination</strong><strong><br /></strong>It uses verbal or nonverbal signals to end communication or interaction.<br /><p>It is important for us to learn the different types of communicative strategies and properly use them in every situation. We also have different kinds of communication.
