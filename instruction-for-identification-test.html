Then, identify which technicalterm used in research is being described in each sentence. Write your answer on theline.1. Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal ofSocial Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which arestudent-centered approach is recommended to modem pedagogy especially todaythat we used outcome-based education.2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing anadopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significantvalues of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level ofsignificance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on theevaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activitiesin English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the nullhypothesis.4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials inteaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to furtherimprove the performance of grammatically challenged learners.5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students asrevealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied. pasagot Ng ayus​</a>

________________ 1. Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which are student-centered approach is recommended to modern pedagogy especially today that we used outcome-based education.
________________ 2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing an adopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.
________________ 3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significant values of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on the evaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activities in English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the null hypothesis.
________________ 4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials in teaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to further improve the performance of grammatically challenged learners.
________________ 5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students as revealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied.</a>

Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal ofSocial Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which arestudent-centered approach is recommended to modem pedagogy especially todaythat we used outcome-based education.2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing anadopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significantvalues of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level ofsignificance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on theevaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activitiesin English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the nullhypothesis.4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials inteaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to furtherimprove the performance of grammatically challenged learners.5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students asrevealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied. pasagot Ng ayus​</h2><br />

________________ 1. Based on the article of Laguador (2014) in International Journal of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, collaborative learning activities which are student-centered approach is recommended to modern pedagogy especially today that we used outcome-based education.
________________ 2. This study used the descriptive method of research utilizing an adopted questionnaire-checklist and experimental method utilizing pre-test and post-test.
________________ 3. The differences of the mean scores obtained the overall significant values of .271. Since the computed p-values are more than or exceed 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference on the evaluation of teacher-respondents on the developed collaborative learning activities in English for Grade 7. In short, the results of significant values favor on the null hypothesis.
________________ 4. Additional intervention material as instructional materials in teaching English aside from the collaborative activities may be developed to further improve the performance of grammatically challenged learners.
________________ 5. To determine the level of performance of the grade 7 students as revealed in pre-test and post-test results, mean and standard deviation were applied.</h2><br />
