                                            The Association of Mathematics Teachers had organized a seminar for mathematics teachers in your region. The theme of the seminar is on conic sections and their application to real life. Inclusive of the registration fee are meals and snacks, a program, training kits, and a T-shirt. The association desires to come up with a common computer-generated graphics design for the front cover page of the program, tarpaulin for the stage, and the T-shirts. The details of the design feature the equations and graphs of conic sections, and their practical applications to life situations. You are one of the famous designer/graphic artists in your province. Knowing your expertise in mathematics, you were contracted by the association to create a design for each of the three mentioned aspects of the seminar. 
Conic Sections as T-shirt Design
Task/s:
1. Create a sketch/draft of your design containing characteristics (graphs, equations, properties) of any conic sections. 
2. The design should include the title of the seminar, theme, date, and venue. You are free to position the text with respect to the design that you have created,
3. There should be at most five colors used in the design.
4. Output must be in a long bond paper.</a>

Use short size bond paper/s for your answer. Objective: Solve a real life situation problem(s) involving quadratic equation using any method. Goal: To make a design of the fixture you choose and present to the class together with your teacher, Homeroom PTA Officers and carpenter. Role: You are a fixture Designer. Audience: Teacher, Homeroom PTA Officers, Carpenter Situation: Your teacher adviser was asked by the principal to transfer her Grade 9 class to one of the classrooms of a newly constructed building in your school. The room however, still does not have fixtures like teacher’s table, bulletin board, bookshelf and cabinet. In order for her to acquire such fixtures she initiated to call for a Homeroom PTA Meeting and informed the parents about her classroom needs. The parents decided to donate voluntarily the materials needed, she also asked the students to make the design of the fixtures that will be used by the carpenter in making the fixtures. Product / Performance: Assuming that you are one of the students involved in this undertakings: a) Choose one of the fixtures to be designed. b) Draw the design. c) Illustrate every part of the fixture including the measurement of the dimensions or area. d) Using the design you made, determine all the mathematical concepts and principles. e) Formulate a problem of these mathematical concepts and principles involving quadratic equation(s). f) Determine what are given, what is asked in the problem and the quadratic equation that described the problem(s). g) Solve the quadratic equation that describes the problem(s).​</a>

                            8. This is a classic case in ethics theory. Imagine that you are involved in a shipwreck situation - a ship has started to sink in the middle of the ocean. Eleven people have jumped into a life-boat that has been designed for a maximum of ten people only, and the life-boat is also starting to sink. What should the passengers do? Throw one person overboard and save ten lives? Or stick to the principle of "do not kill", which means that everybody will drown? ​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:From a strategic standpoint, there must be at least some people that are strong enough to row the boat. The boat is relatively large, too, so the group must be able to work together. This means that strategically speaking, it would be wise to have people of roughly equivalent strength in the same positions. This might make it imperative to have 25 men and 25 women, finding folks who can row together in order to maximize the chances of everyone in the boat making it home safely. It would not be smart to have all large, strong people, as this would seem to make it less likely that the boat can make it to shore safely.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Key Points
</p><p>A conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane; the three types are parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas.
</p><p>A conic section can be graphed on a coordinate plane.
</p><p>Every conic section has certain features, including at least one focus and directrix. Parabolas have one focus and directrix, while ellipses and hyperbolas have two of each.
</p><p>A conic section is the set of points  </p><p>P
</p><p> whose
</p><p>distance to the focus is a constant multiple of the distance from  </p><p>P
</p><p> to the directrix of the conic.
</p><p>Key Terms
</p><p>vertex: An extreme point on a conic section.
</p><p>asymptote: A straight line which a curve approaches arbitrarily closely as it goes to infinity.
</p><p>locus: The set of all points whose coordinates satisfy a given equation or condition.
</p><p>focus: A point used to construct and define a conic section, at which rays reflected from the curve converge (plural: foci).
</p><p>nappe: One half of a double cone.
</p><p>conic section: Any curve formed by the intersection of a plane with a cone of two nappes.
</p><p>directrix: A line used to construct and define a conic section; a parabola has one directrix; ellipses and hyperbolas have two (plural: directrices).</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Use short size bond paper/s for your answer. Objective: Solve a real life situation problem(s) involving quadratic equation using any method. Goal: To make a design of the fixture you choose and present to the class together with your teacher, Homeroom PTA Officers and carpenter. Role: You are a fixture Designer. Audience: Teacher, Homeroom PTA Officers, Carpenter Situation: Your teacher adviser was asked by the principal to transfer her Grade 9 class to one of the classrooms of a newly constructed building in your school. The room however, still does not have fixtures like teacher’s table, bulletin board, bookshelf and cabinet. In order for her to acquire such fixtures she initiated to call for a Homeroom PTA Meeting and informed the parents about her classroom needs. The parents decided to donate voluntarily the materials needed, she also asked the students to make the design of the fixtures that will be used by the carpenter in making the fixtures. Product / Performance: Assuming that you are one of the students involved in this undertakings: a) Choose one of the fixtures to be designed. b) Draw the design. c) Illustrate every part of the fixture including the measurement of the dimensions or area. d) Using the design you made, determine all the mathematical concepts and principles. e) Formulate a problem of these mathematical concepts and principles involving quadratic equation(s). f) Determine what are given, what is asked in the problem and the quadratic equation that described the problem(s). g) Solve the quadratic equation that describes the problem(s).​</h2><br />

Inclusive of the registration fee are meals and snacks, program, training kits a T-shirt.The association desires to come up with a common computer-generated graphics design for the front cover of the program, tarpaulin for the stage and the T-shirts. The details of the design feature the equations and graphs of conic sections and their practical application to life situations. 	You are one of the famous designers/ graphic artists in your province. Knowing your expertise in Mathematics, you were contracted by the association to create a design for each of the three mentioned aspects of the seminar. The following are the additional instructions given: 	a. The design should contain any of the characteristics (graphs, equations, properties) of any of the four conic sections- circle, parabola, ellipse and hyperbola. b. There should be at most five colors used in the design. c. For the T-shirt, the design should include the title of the seminar, theme, date, and venue. You are free to position the text with respect to the design that you have created. d. The front cover of the program and the tarpaulin should indicate the title of the seminar, theme, date, and venue, and the name of the association. e. The design should be relevant to the theme of the seminar. 	 	The design will be evaluated based on its relevance to the theme, originality, creativity and overall visual quality/ impact​</h2><br />

For instance, a cancer biologist might notice that a certain kind of cancer can't be treated with chemotherapy and wonder why this is the case. A marine ecologist, seeing that the coral reefs of her field sites are bleaching—turning white—might set out to understand why.
