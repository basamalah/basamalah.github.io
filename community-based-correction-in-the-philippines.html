Here and there stumps ofcoconut trees protruded. Alongside a rutted dirt path were petrol torches, made oftattered cloths attached to the ends of bamboo poles. Marked by potholes, thepath ran diagonally toward the camp before making an abrupt turn, and then, forseveral meters, continued in a straight line. It ended where an empty and uncoveredsix-by-six Army truck was parked.An excerpt from: Enriquez, Antonio Subanons. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press, 1999.1.
