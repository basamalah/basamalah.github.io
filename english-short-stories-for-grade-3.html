Read the short story then answer each question.
Why Does the Ocean Have Waves?
The ocean is never still. Whether observing from the beach or a boat, we expect
to see waves on the horizon. Waves are created by energy passing through
water, causing it to move in a circular motion. However, water does not actually
travel in waves. Waves transmit energy, not water, across the ocean and if not
obstructed by anything, they have the potential to travel across an entire ocean
basin.
Waves are most commonly caused by wind. Wind-driven waves, or surface
waves, are created by the friction between wind and surface water. As wind
blows across the surface of the ocean or a lake, the continual disturbance
creates a wave crest. These types of waves are found globally across the open
ocean and along the coast.

More potentially hazardous waves can be caused by severe weather, like a
hurricane. The strong winds and pressure from this type of severe storm causes
storm surge, a series of long waves that are created far from shore in deeper
water and intensify as they move closer to land.
Other hazardous waves can be caused by underwater disturbances that
displace large amounts of water quickly such as earthquakes, landslides, or
volcanic eruptions. These very long waves are called tsunamis. Storm surgeand
tsunamis are not the types of waves you imagine crashing down on the shore.
These waves roll upon the shore like a massive sea level rise and can reach far
distances inland. The gravitational pull of the sun and moon on the earth also
causes waves. These waves are tides or, in other words, tidal waves. It is a
common misconception that a tidal wave is also a tsunami. The cause of
tsunamis is not related to tide information at all but can occur in any tidal state.

Find out how the narrator’s father fulfilled his responsibilities to his family. My Father Goes to Court  by  Carlos BulosanThis story was narrated by a four-year old kid whose family lived in a small town in Luzon. His father’s farm was destroyed by a flood. That was the reason why they preferred to live in a new place. They had a rich man neighbor, and the rich man’s children rarely went outside. Their house was tall, where their family could watch the farmer’s kids play outside their house. The rich man’s Servants were always cooking delicious food like fried chicken, ham, and bacon. The farmer’s family would always take a whiff of the heavenly essence of the rich man’s foods. The narrator’s family always bonds outside in the sun and bathes in the river. They always had a good time and had a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watches them. As days passed on, the rich man’s family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants were always cooking something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always closed, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind. One morning, a policeman knocked on the door of the narrator’s house. The rich man had a complaint against them, because they were accused of stealing the spirit or essence of their food. When the trial came, the narrator’s family came first. After a few minutes, the rich man’s family came with a lawyer, their body was so thin, and they looked sick. The narrator’s father didn’t have any lawyer, he fought on his own. The trial starts, the lawyer questions the narrator’s father. In the first question, the father didn’t agree that they stole the spirit of the wealth and the food.The father agreed in the second question, where he stated that their family hung outside the rich man’s house and inhaled the food. He also agreed that when the rich man’s family became sick, their family became strong and healthy. The rich man’s children went in shyly. They were really thin and looked sick. When it was time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who questioned him. The rich man agreed that while their family was having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad, and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the farmer’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooked the food. The narrator’s father committed to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collected some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father was ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed. The judge told the narrator’s father the story where his uncle died because of laughing. The judge likes to hear the narrator's family laughing. The kid’s sisters started to laugh, and all of the people in the courtroom laughed and the judge’s laugh was the loudest of all.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I got cha</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, in a vast, lush forest, there were many different kinds of frogs. Each of them had a unique appearance, habitat, and behavior.</p><p></p><p>The first kind of frog was the Poison Dart Frog. It was a small, brightly colored frog that lived in the rainforest. It was known for its toxic skin, which could kill predators or even humans who touched it. The Poison Dart Frog was also very fast, which helped it escape from danger.</p><p></p><p>The second kind of frog was the Tree Frog. It was a small, green or brown frog that lived in trees. The Tree Frog was excellent at climbing and had sticky pads on its toes, which helped it cling to branches. The Tree Frog was also known for its loud croak, which it used to communicate with other Tree Frogs.</p><p></p><p>The third kind of frog was the Bullfrog. It was a large, green or brown frog that lived near ponds and lakes. The Bullfrog was known for its deep croak, which could be heard from a great distance. It was also an excellent swimmer and could jump long distances, making it an excellent hunter.</p><p></p><p>The fourth kind of frog was the Goliath Frog. It was the largest frog in the world and lived in the rainforest near rivers and streams. The Goliath Frog could grow up to a foot long and weigh over six pounds. Despite its size, it was a gentle giant and fed on insects and small animals.</p><p></p><p>The fifth kind of frog was the Glass Frog. It was a small, transparent frog that lived in the rainforest. The Glass Frog was known for its unique appearance, as its internal organs could be seen through its skin. It was also an excellent climber and could blend into its surroundings.</p><p></p><p>As the sun set over the forest, each kind of frog settled into its habitat. The Poison Dart Frog climbed onto a leaf, the Tree Frog nestled in a tree, the Bullfrog sat by the pond, the Goliath Frog settled near the river, and the Glass Frog perched on a branch. Despite their differences, each kind of frog was important to the ecosystem and played a vital role in the forest's balance.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A group of frogs was traveling through the woods and two of them fell into a deep pit. When the other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.</p><p></p><p>The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, “Did you not hear us?” The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time.</p><p></p><p>Moral: There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day. So be careful of what you say. Speak life to those who cross your path. The power of words… it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging word can go such a long way.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Read the short story then answer each question.
Why Does the Ocean Have Waves?
The ocean is never still. Whether observing from the beach or a boat, we expect
to see waves on the horizon. Waves are created by energy passing through
water, causing it to move in a circular motion. However, water does not actually
travel in waves. Waves transmit energy, not water, across the ocean and if not
obstructed by anything, they have the potential to travel across an entire ocean
basin.
Waves are most commonly caused by wind. Wind-driven waves, or surface
waves, are created by the friction between wind and surface water. As wind
blows across the surface of the ocean or a lake, the continual disturbance
creates a wave crest. These types of waves are found globally across the open
ocean and along the coast.
3 │ ENGLISH 4, WEEK 2 QUARTER 4
More potentially hazardous waves can be caused by severe weather, like a
hurricane. The strong winds and pressure from this type of severe storm causes
storm surge, a series of long waves that are created far from shore in deeper
water and intensify as they move closer to land.
Other hazardous waves can be caused by underwater disturbances that
displace large amounts of water quickly such as earthquakes, landslides, or
volcanic eruptions. These very long waves are called tsunamis. Storm surgeand
tsunamis are not the types of waves you imagine crashing down on the shore.
These waves roll upon the shore like a massive sea level rise and can reach far
distances inland. The gravitational pull of the sun and moon on the earth also
causes waves. These waves are tides or, in other words, tidal waves. It is a
common misconception that a tidal wave is also a tsunami. The cause of
tsunamis is not related to tide information at all but can occur in any tidal state.

Find out how the narrator’s father fulfilled his responsibilities to his family. My Father Goes to Court  by  Carlos BulosanThis story was narrated by a four-year old kid whose family lived in a small town in Luzon. His father’s farm was destroyed by a flood. That was the reason why they preferred to live in a new place. They had a rich man neighbor, and the rich man’s children rarely went outside. Their house was tall, where their family could watch the farmer’s kids play outside their house. The rich man’s Servants were always cooking delicious food like fried chicken, ham, and bacon. The farmer’s family would always take a whiff of the heavenly essence of the rich man’s foods. The narrator’s family always bonds outside in the sun and bathes in the river. They always had a good time and had a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watches them. As days passed on, the rich man’s family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants were always cooking something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always closed, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind. One morning, a policeman knocked on the door of the narrator’s house. The rich man had a complaint against them, because they were accused of stealing the spirit or essence of their food. When the trial came, the narrator’s family came first. After a few minutes, the rich man’s family came with a lawyer, their body was so thin, and they looked sick. The narrator’s father didn’t have any lawyer, he fought on his own. The trial starts, the lawyer questions the narrator’s father. In the first question, the father didn’t agree that they stole the spirit of the wealth and the food.The father agreed in the second question, where he stated that their family hung outside the rich man’s house and inhaled the food. He also agreed that when the rich man’s family became sick, their family became strong and healthy. The rich man’s children went in shyly. They were really thin and looked sick. When it was time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who questioned him. The rich man agreed that while their family was having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad, and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the farmer’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooked the food. The narrator’s father committed to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collected some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father was ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed. The judge told the narrator’s father the story where his uncle died because of laughing. The judge likes to hear the narrator's family laughing. The kid’s sisters started to laugh, and all of the people in the courtroom laughed and the judge’s laugh was the loudest of all.
