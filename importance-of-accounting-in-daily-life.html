                                            My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

Everyone having their own account is better for security reasons. For instance no one can access anyone else's account without their password.</p><p>If multiple users will be using the same computer, you may want to create a new account for each person. Windows allows you to create multiple user accounts.

                            9. My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.
