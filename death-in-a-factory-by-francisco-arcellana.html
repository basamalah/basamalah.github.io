                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Francisco "Franz" Arcellana</strong> (September 6, 1916 – August 1, 2002) was a Filipino writer, poet, essayist, critic, journalist and teacher. He was born on September 6, 1916. Arcellana already had ambitions of becoming a writer early in his childhood. His actual writing, however, started when he became a member of The Torres Torch Organization during his high school years. Arcellana continued writing in various school papers at the University of the Philippines Diliman. Later on he received a Rockefeller Grant and became a fellow in Creative Writing at the University of Iowa and at the Breadloaf Writers' Conference from 1956– 1957.He is considered an important progenitor of the modern Filipino short story in English. Arcellana pioneered the development of the short story as a lyrical prose-poetic form within Filipino literature. His works are now often taught in tertiary-level syllabi in the Philippines. Many of his works were translated into Tagalog, Malaysian, Russian, Italian, and German. Arcellana won 2nd place in the 1951 Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, with his short story, The Flowers of May. Fourteen of his short stories were also included in Jose Garcia Villa's Honor Roll from 1928 to 1939. His major achievements included the first award in art criticism from the Art Association of the Philippines in 1954, the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city government of Manila in 1981, and the Gawad Pambansang Alagad ni Balagtas for English fiction from the Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipino (UMPIL) in 1988.</p><br />

                        Francisco Arcellana (1916 to 2002) was a highly regarded poet, essayist, critic, journalist and teacher.  It is for his short stories that he is best remembered.  He is considered one of the first writers of the modern Filipino short story in English.    It is his lyrical style that became the role model for a generation of writers.   He was proclaimed a national artist of the Philippines in 1990 and was given a state funeral.  Much of his career was spent at The University of the Philippines Diliman, not far from where I live. I have previously posted on his short story "The Mats".<br /><br />"The Flowers of May" is almost a Filipino version of "The Dead" by James Joyce.  There were no memories of snow covered countryside in the consciousness of many Filipinos in 1951 but there are memories of the beautiful flowers of May, of May in the churches of Manila and in the old walled city. The narrator thinks of his sister Victoria who died in May.  The narrator speaks of the great depth of pain of his father, his morher's perhaps futile attempt to comfort his father over the loss.  He speaks of many dead from his family.  The story is very well set in place but the concerns are universal.<br /><br />This is a beautiful heartbreaking story.  There cannot be much worse a thing than for a beloved child to pass in youth.  Faith offers the consolation of an early entry into heaven and perhaps an eventual reunion but this can be cold or even a mocking comfort.<br /><br />"The Flowers of May" is about how life can be turned into a charnel house,a great city into a dark necropolis.  This is a world class short story.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: The story entitled “The Mats” was written by Francisco Arcellana, one of the admirable literary Filipino artists. The story talks about a typical Filipino family culture, that portrays the close family relationship, respect for the elders and remembering the family members who passed away.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>            The story begins with the homecoming of Mr. Angeles who came from Mariveles. He wrote a letter for his family about the real weaver artist who make a marvelous mats. Apparently, he would bring home his family some mats from this mat weaver.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>            Knowing that the rest of the family members will receive their own personalized sleeping mats, they became excited about the news. It was not just an ordinary mat that they would receive but a personalized mat with their names and a color depending on their birthstone. I can sense here, how much joy the kids felt when they heard the news. Giving gifts is part of our tradition when some come back home. This shows how much Mr. Angeles love his family.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>            The mat plays an important role to Emelia and Mr. Angeles, for Nana Emelia received a mat by her mother when she got married to Mr. Angeles. It shows in this story that Filipinos are naturally sentimental. Filipinos always treasure the things we received from our special someone, family, friends, etc. It shows how Filipinos care for that certain thing they received from others.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>            Finally, Mr. Angeles arrived and the kids were excited to received their personalized sleeping mats. Mr. Angeles distributed the mats to his children as he calls the names that’s on the mat. Now they were all done but there are three mats left. Those mats were for their kids who passed away. This only show that even though they’re dead they remain in the heart of their father. So, the story taught us that we should not forget our loved ones no matter how many years had passed. The sleeping mats used as an outlet to pay as a tribute to his three kids who were not with them anymore.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>SHARE THIS:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. what is the fiction used in Excerpt from Flowers of May by Francisco Arcellana?​</h2><br />
                        <p>rancisco Arcellana was born on September 6, 1916. He already had ambitions of becoming a writer early in his childhood. His actual writing, however, started when he became a member of The Torres Torch Organization during his high school years. Arcellana continued writing in various school papers at the University of the Philippines Diliman. Later on he received a Rockefeller Grant and became a fellow in Creative Writing at the University of Iowa and at the Breadloaf Writers' Conference from 1956– 1957.[2][3]
</p><p>
</p><p>He is considered an important progenitor of the modern Filipino short story in English. Arcellana pioneered the development of the short story as a lyrical prose-poetic form within Filipino literature. His works are now often taught in tertiary-level syllabi in the Philippines. Many of his works were translated into Tagalog, Malaysian, Russian, Italian, and German. Arcellana won 2nd place in the 1951 Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, with his short story, The Flowers of May. Fourteen of his short stories were also included in Jose Garcia Villa's Honor Roll from 1928 to 1939. His major achievements included the first award in art criticism from the Art Association of the Philippines in 1954, the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city government of Manila in 1981, and the Gawad Pambansang Alagad ni Balagtas for English fiction from the Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipino (UMPIL) in 1988.
</p><p>
</p><p>The University of the Philippines conferred upon Arcellana a doctorate in humane letters, honoris causa in 1989. Francisco Arcellana was proclaimed National Artist of the Philippines in Literature on June 23, 1990 by then Philippine President Corazon C. Aquino.[4]
</p><p>
</p><p>In 2009, or seven years after his death, his family came out with a book to pay tribute to National Artist for Literature Arcellana. The book entitled Franz is a collection of essays gathered by the Arcellana family from colleagues, friends, students and family members, including fellow National Artist Nick Joaquin, Butch Dalisay, Recah Trinidad, Jing Hidalgo, Gemino Abad, Romina Gonzalez, Edwin Cordevilla, Divina Aromin, Doreen Yu, Danton Remoto, Jose Esteban Arcellana and other</p><br />
