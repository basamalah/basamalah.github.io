                                            The Value of Peopleby Jim JohnsonWhen I worked as an errand boy at a big store, a rich lady came in and bought a veryexpensive Chinese vase. As I went off to deliver it, the boss gave me a stern warning to beextra careful. I found the lady's mansion, and just as I was squeezing in through a half-opengate, I heard something break inside the parcel. I went pale with fear. I wanted to run awayJust then the large mansion door opened and an elderly lady came out I was veryworried about what I was going to tell her, when suddenly a large playful shepherd dog camebounding across the lawn and jumping right on top of me, knocking the vase to the ground witha smashing sound. The lady came hurrying over, while the dog licked my face. Excitedly, sheasked, "For heaven's sake, lad, I hope you're not hurt."And then I started, "About the vase, I just wanted to tell you..." But I never got to say it"Oh, the vase?" she said. "That's nothing to worry about... But how about you? Youknow, that dog is still young and probably thought you wanted to play with him... Are youalright?"Well, she gave me a good tip for bringing the vase. And I patted the dog on the head. Hehad been my savior.I can never forget that lady, who thought more about me than that valuable vase.Learning Task:Directions. Answer the following questions below. Write your answer on the line.1.

                                            The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</a>

The father continued, "Did you see how poor people can be?" The boy just said, "Yeah!" The father asked again, "And what did you learn?" The boy answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden; they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars; our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon. When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.

Consequently, the title is both ironical and symbolical.</p><p>5.A primary reason for poverty among families (and individuals) is low education, which usually leads to low wages. ... And just as the payoff to education has been growing, so too have gaps in educational attainment between children from higher- and lower-income families.</p><p>6.Point out instances where the main characters displayed ignorance &amp; illiteracy.  This is a problem between a character and an outsideforce.For example,the main character is fighting with another character in the story. </p><p>7.???</p><p>8.hitting Budapest relates to the Marxism because it portrays the social and economic conditions of the 6 african children who are illiterate and poor.</p><br />

                            14. The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</h2><br />

                            29. Please read the paragraph below and answer the questions on a 1/2 crosswise. Thank you One day a father and his rich family took his young son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be. They spent a day and a night in the farm of a very poor family. When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, "How was the trip?" The boy replied, "Very good, Dad!" The father continued, "Did you see how poor people can be?" The boy just said, "Yeah!" The father asked again, "And what did you learn?" The boy answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden; they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars; our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon. When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless. The son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!".Questions. 1. What does the main character (or other characters) do to cause the problem? 2. What does the main character (or other characters) do to resolve the problem? 3. How are the characters affected by the incident or the experience?​</h2><br />
                        The father and his rich family take their young son on a trip to the country with the intention of showing him how poor people can be.The main character (the young son) doesn't do anything to resolve the problem since there is no real problem in the story. However, he does provide a different perspective on the trip when asked about it by his father, which could be seen as resolving the initial purpose of the trip for his father.The father is initially trying to teach his son a lesson about poverty, but his son's response shows him that he may have missed the point of the trip. The son, on the other hand, gains a new perspective on his own family's wealth and privilege, realizing that there are other ways of living that can be just as fulfilling, if not more so. Overall, the experience seems to have a positive impact on the son, while leaving the father speechless and potentially reconsidering his approach to teaching his son about the world.<br />
