Poetry
By Nikki Giovanni
Poetry is motion graceful
as a fawn
gentle as a teardrop
strong like the eye
finding peace in a crowded room
We poets tend to think
our words are golden
though emotion speaks too
loudly to be defined
by silence
Sometimes after midnight or just before
the dawn
we sit typewriter in hand
pulling loneliness around us
forgetting our lovers or children
who are sleeping
ignoring the weary wariness 
of our own logic
to compose a poem
No one understands it
it never says “love me” for poets are
beyond love it never says “accept me” for poems speak not
acceptance but controversy
it only says “i am” and therefore
I concede that you are too
A poem is pure energy
horizontally contained
between the mind
of the poet and the ear of the reader
if it does not sing discard the ear
for poetry is song
if it does not delight discard
the heart for poetry is joy
if it does not inform then close
off the brain for it is dead
if it cannot heed the insistent message
that life is precious
which is all we poets
wrapped in our loneliness
are trying to say</a>

Poetry
By Nikki Giovanni
Poetry is motion graceful
as a fawn
gentle as a teardrop
strong like the eye
finding peace in a crowded room
We poets tend to think
our words are golden
though emotion speaks too
loudly to be defined
by silence
Sometimes after midnight or just before
the dawn
we sit typewriter in hand
pulling loneliness around us
forgetting our lovers or children
who are sleeping
ignoring the weary wariness 
of our own logic
to compose a poem
No one understands it
it never says “love me” for poets are
beyond love it never says “accept me” for poems speak not
acceptance but controversy
it only says “i am” and therefore
I concede that you are too
A poem is pure energy
horizontally contained
between the mind
of the poet and the ear of the reader
if it does not sing discard the ear
for poetry is song
if it does not delight discard
the heart for poetry is joy
if it does not inform then close
off the brain for it is dead
if it cannot heed the insistent message
that life is precious
which is all we poets
wrapped in our loneliness
are trying to say</h2><br />
