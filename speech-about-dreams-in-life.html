                                            I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

                                            Can I have some help?
Paragragh 14: And Fanny fully shared the joy of her friend; joy is so contagious. Tomorrow Rudolf will arrive, and how nice it will then be for Flora! She will see the greatest joy that a loving heart can imagine, and will not be a bit jealous—no! She will rejoice in another’s joy, rejoice in the happiness of her best friend, who possesses as her very own, so to speak, the man in whose honor every one has spoken so well and made such pretty speeches. And tomorrow he will be here; and, to make his wife happy till he comes, he has notified the day of his arrival. Oh what a joy it will be even to look upon such happiness!
The two ladies with radiantly happy faces returned to the company, which diverted itself till midnight, when everyone retired to his own room. Squire John helped his guests to their repose with a musical accompaniment, the band proceeding from window to window and intoning beneath each one a sleep-compelling symphony. Finally, the last note died away, and everybody dozed off, and dreamed beautiful dreams. The hunters dreamed of foxes (there was to be a hunt the next day), the orators dreamed of assemblies, Mr. Málnay dreamed of parties, and Lady Szentirmay dreamed of her husband.
In paragraph 14, the reactions from Lady Fanny toward Lady Flora reveal about the perspective of loyalty and honor?
	A.	
the reactions reveal that being virtuous does not come by riches and wealth, but comes by having a geniune heart and a pure respect for each other's happiness.
	B.	
the reactions reveal that being a woman of power and wealth one must remove themselves from the apperance of happiness and privately display happiness.
	C.	
the reactions reveal that Lady Fanny is a busy body in other people's affairs of life.
	D.	
the reactions reveal that close friends share the same happiness while on is secretly missing joy.</a>

questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. 
“I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher 
in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. 
My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare 
rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and 
during my early youth, my father saved as much as he 
could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos 
with which to give me an education. During those 
Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small 
town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, 
did my family live for years. When I was at the age of 
five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father 
and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary 
instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and 
began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived 
in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who 
could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My 
classes started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very 
early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the 
following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an 
intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest 
honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my 
education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my 
studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came 
to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had 
become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a 
lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me 
as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board 
and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.”

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family.

Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2.

We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4.

A dream contains ideas, emotions as well as images. Everyone watches dreams; the occurrence of dreams takes place with each and every human being. But only a few of them remember it.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p>Read a variety of poems first. I would recommend a couple of different kinds of poems before assigning any writing activities. For more ideas on how to start a unit on poetry, be sure to take a look at Introducing and Reading Poetry with English Language Learners. While the introduction doesn't have to be too in-depth, giving students time to read and think about poems will help them feel more comfortable when it's time to write.Introduce different poetry forms as models. Read some poems that fit the structure or format, discuss unique rhyming or line patterns, and then have students try writing on their own, using the poems read in class as a model. Focus on each form before moving on to the next one so that students have a chance to master it.Use poetry throughout the curriculum. You may also wish to use poetry writing as an activity in other content-area lessons, or trying having students write some of these poems as riddles that their classmates have to figure out.<br />

                            9. I Shall Return; by Claude McKay 
I shall return again; I shall return
To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
At golden noon the forest fires burn,
Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
I shall return to loiter by the streams
That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
And realize once more my thousand dreams
Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
That stir the hidden depths of native life,
Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
I shall return, I shall return again,
To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.

of the persona?
3. What figures of speech are present in the poem? What do they mean?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.  The persona in the poem is a person who is longing to return to Africa, their homeland. The persona misses the beauty and culture of Africa, and yearns to experience it again.</p><p></p><p>2.  The poem describes Africa as a place of natural beauty, with forests, streams, and mountain passes. The persona fondly remembers the sounds of village dances and the music of the fiddle and fife. This implies that the persona has strong feelings of nostalgia and longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>3.  The poem contains several figures of speech, including personification (the forest fires "burn"), metaphor (the "sapphire skies"), and imagery (the "brown blades of the bending grasses"). These figures of speech help to create a vivid and evocative picture of Africa in the reader's mind, and convey the persona's strong feelings of longing for their homeland.</p><p></p><p>4.  The overall theme of the poem is the longing for home and the desire to return to one's roots. The persona speaks of their desire to experience the beauty and culture of Africa once again, and the poem suggests that this longing is driven by a sense of nostalgia and a desire to reconnect with one's heritage. The message of the poem is that our roots and our sense of belonging are important to us, and that we may yearn to return to the places that hold special meaning to us.</p><p></p><br />

                            12. Can I have some help?
Paragragh 14: And Fanny fully shared the joy of her friend; joy is so contagious. Tomorrow Rudolf will arrive, and how nice it will then be for Flora! She will see the greatest joy that a loving heart can imagine, and will not be a bit jealous—no! She will rejoice in another’s joy, rejoice in the happiness of her best friend, who possesses as her very own, so to speak, the man in whose honor every one has spoken so well and made such pretty speeches. And tomorrow he will be here; and, to make his wife happy till he comes, he has notified the day of his arrival. Oh what a joy it will be even to look upon such happiness!
The two ladies with radiantly happy faces returned to the company, which diverted itself till midnight, when everyone retired to his own room. Squire John helped his guests to their repose with a musical accompaniment, the band proceeding from window to window and intoning beneath each one a sleep-compelling symphony. Finally, the last note died away, and everybody dozed off, and dreamed beautiful dreams. The hunters dreamed of foxes (there was to be a hunt the next day), the orators dreamed of assemblies, Mr. Málnay dreamed of parties, and Lady Szentirmay dreamed of her husband.
In paragraph 14, the reactions from Lady Fanny toward Lady Flora reveal about the perspective of loyalty and honor?
	A.	
the reactions reveal that being virtuous does not come by riches and wealth, but comes by having a geniune heart and a pure respect for each other's happiness.
	B.	
the reactions reveal that being a woman of power and wealth one must remove themselves from the apperance of happiness and privately display happiness.
	C.	
the reactions reveal that Lady Fanny is a busy body in other people's affairs of life.
	D.	
the reactions reveal that close friends share the same happiness while on is secretly missing joy.</h2><br />

You are going to read it carefully then you will assess the speech by answering the questions that follow.1. What did the speaker consider more significant than being a valedictorian? Why?2. What are the factors that contributed to the speaker’s political setback?3. What details about his life can his audience learn from him?4. What was the secret dream of the speaker during her high school days?5. What are the inherent lessons the speaker learned from his/ her high school experience?</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>1.	The speaker understood life and was the most triumphant moment of his/her life which became more significant than the awards given. The speaker once just know life, but knowing life and understanding it is very much different. His imperfections led his/her, not only the dark road but understanding life’s concept.</p><p>2.	First, the speaker didn’t have enough funds because of being impoverish and because of this the people thought the speaker only have the intention to be an SK chairman for the salary/honorarium. Aside from that, the speaker was rumored as crazy because of facing depression. The people didn’t really see the true intentions of our speaker. </p><p>3.	That life is not only about knowing it, but understanding it. Even as a hypothetical audience, I’ve learned that imperfections are part of life but to truly understand life’s greatest concept, you also need to embrace them. Another one is that the world is cruel and life is full of test and if you will focus to world’s cruelty and to life’s unending test, you will never ever experience life itself. “Behind the hostility of the world always look at the glass half full not half empty”.</p><p>4.	The speaker’s dream was to become a part of the SSG even more being the president of the organization, being able to compete and represent the school in prestigious competitions, and have his name written in the school publication. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Learning Task 1: Read President Manuel L. Quezon’s autobiography 
taken from his privilege speech delivered in 1933. Then, answer the 
questions that follow. Do this in your notebook. 
“I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher 
in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines—Baler. 
My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare 
rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and 
during my early youth, my father saved as much as he 
could from his meager salary and from what he could 
get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos 
with which to give me an education. During those 
Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small 
town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, 
did my family live for years. When I was at the age of 
five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father 
and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary 
instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and 
began my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived 
in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one 
priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved 
me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. 
The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who 
could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My 
classes started at seven o’clock in the morning and I had to get up very 
early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the 
following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an 
intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest 
honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my 
education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my 
studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came 
to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had 
become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a 
lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me 
as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board 
and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.”

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4.
