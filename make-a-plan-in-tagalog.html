                                            The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together. Goods and services are produced and resources are supplied by whoever is willing and able to do so. The result is competition among independently  acting buyers and sellers of each product and resource. Thus, economic decision making is widely dispersed. Also,  the high potential monetary rewards create powerful in centives for existing firms to innovate and entrepreneurs  to pioneer new products and processes. In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production. The government owns most of the business firms, which produce according to government directives. The central planning board determines production goals for each en terprise and specifies the amount of resources to be allo.  pakiexplain naman po sakin ng tagalog. buod po. salamat​</a>

                            10. The Market System The polar alternative to the command system is the mar ket system, or capitalism. The system is characterized by the private ownership of resources and the use of markets  and prices to coordinate and direct economic activity.  Participants act in their own self-interest. Individuals and  businesses seek to achieve their economic goals through  their own decisions regarding work, consumption, or  production. The system allows for the private ownership  of capital, communicates through prices, and coordinates economic activity through markets—places where buyers and sellers come together. Goods and services are produced and resources are supplied by whoever is willing and able to do so. The result is competition among independently  acting buyers and sellers of each product and resource. Thus, economic decision making is widely dispersed. Also,  the high potential monetary rewards create powerful in centives for existing firms to innovate and entrepreneurs  to pioneer new products and processes. In pure capitalism—or laissez-faire capitalism— government’s role would be limited to protecting private  tribution of output, and the organization of production. The government owns most of the business firms, which produce according to government directives. The central planning board determines production goals for each en terprise and specifies the amount of resources to be allo.  pakiexplain naman po sakin ng tagalog. buod po. salamat​</h2><br />
