                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Globalization is the word used to describe the growing interdependence of the world’s economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information. Countries have built economic partnerships to facilitate these movements over many centuries. This guide uses the term more narrowly to refer to international trade and some of the investment flows among advanced economies, mostly focusing on the United States. The wide-ranging effects of globalization are complex and politically charged. As with major technological advances, globalization benefits society as a whole, while harming certain groups. Understanding the relative costs and benefits can pave the way for alleviating problems while sustaining the wider payoffs.Globalization decrease the cost of manufacturing. This means that companies can offer goods at a lower price to consumers. Ang Average cost ng mga goods ay isang mahalagang aspeto na nag-aambag sa pagtaas sa pamantayan ng pamumuhay. Ang mga consumers ay mayroon ding access sa mas malawak na iba't ibang mga goods. Social and economic factors, such as income, education, employment, community safety, and social supports can significally affect how well and how long we live. These factors affect our ability to make healthy choices, afford medical care and housing, and manage stress and more. Economist generally agree that economic development and growth are influenced by four factors: human resources, physical capital, natural capital, natural resources and technology. Highly developed na bansa na naka focus sa mga lugar na ito. Ang mga hindi gaanong maunlad na countries, even those with high amounts ofnatural resources, will lag behind when they fail to promote research in technology at improve nila ang skills at education ng mga kanilang manggagawa dahil ang mga skills at education at training ng mga labor force ay may direct effect on the growth of an economy. A skilled, well trained workforce ay more productive at magpoproduce ng high-quality output that adds efficiency to an economy. Shortage ng skilled labor ay pwede pababain ang economic growth ng isang bansa at under-utilized, illiterate and unskilled workforce will become a drag on an economy and may possibly lead to higher unemploymen</p><br />

                        <p>Parents must educate their children on the use of condoms even at an early age. This is because condoms are the most effective way to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unwanted pregnancies. Although there are many other methods of contraception available, condoms are the only method that offers protection against both STDs and pregnancy.</p><p>Condoms are made from latex, polyurethane, or lambskin. They work by blocking sperm from reaching the egg. Latex condoms are the most effective at preventing STDs, while lambskin condoms are the least effective. Condoms are available without a prescription in most pharmacies. They are also available for free at many health clinics.</p><p>Parents should talk to their children about condoms as early as possible. They must understand how to use condoms correctly. They should also be taught about the importance of using condoms every time they have sex.</p><p>Many young people are reluctant to use condoms because they think it will make sex less enjoyable. However, this is not true. If used correctly, condoms can enhance sex. They can also help couples feel connected to each other during sex.</p><p>Parents should also be sure to stress the importance of using condoms during anal and oral sex. STDs can be spread through these activities as well. In addition, parents should tell their children that they should never share condoms with anyone else.</p><p>Condoms are an invaluable part of keeping both men and women healthy. They are also a crucial part of preventing unwanted pregnancies. Parents should make sure their children are educated about condoms so that they can make responsible decisions about their sexual health.</p><br />

                        Discipline is an essential aspect of human life that is often synonymous with order, control, and self-regulation. It is the process of training oneself or others to behave in a particular way, often to achieve a specific goal or purpose. Discipline can be observed in various aspects of life, including personal habits, social interactions, and professional conduct. In this essay, we will explore the importance of discipline, its benefits, and some strategies for cultivating discipline in our lives.<br /><br />The importance of discipline can be seen in various aspects of life. In personal habits, discipline is necessary for achieving goals and maintaining good health. For example, a disciplined exercise routine is essential for staying fit and healthy. Similarly, a disciplined diet is important for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. In addition, discipline in personal habits such as time-management and sleep can help individuals achieve their goals and lead productive lives.<br /><br />Discipline is also important in social interactions. It helps individuals to control their emotions and behave appropriately in different social situations. For instance, discipline helps individuals to communicate effectively, listen actively, and maintain positive relationships with others. It also helps individuals to avoid conflicts and resolve disputes in a peaceful and constructive manner.<br /><br />In professional conduct, discipline is essential for achieving success and advancing one's career. A disciplined work ethic, punctuality, and attention to detail are all attributes that are highly valued in the workplace. Discipline also helps individuals to manage their time effectively, prioritize tasks, and meet deadlines, which are all critical skills in today's fast-paced and competitive work environment.<br /><br />The benefits of discipline are numerous and far-reaching. Discipline helps individuals to develop self-control, which is crucial for achieving long-term goals and personal growth. It also helps individuals to overcome challenges and obstacles, develop resilience, and persevere in the face of adversity. Discipline also helps individuals to develop a sense of responsibility and accountability, which are essential traits for success in life.<br /><br />In addition to these personal benefits, discipline also contributes to the well-being of society as a whole. It helps to maintain order and stability, prevent crime and violence, and promote social cohesion and harmony. Discipline also fosters respect for rules and authority, which are essential for maintaining democratic institutions and the rule of law.<br /><br />Despite its many benefits, cultivating discipline can be challenging. It requires effort, commitment, and persistence. However, there are several strategies that individuals can use to develop discipline in their lives.<br /><br />One strategy for developing discipline is to set clear goals and priorities. By identifying what is most important and focusing on specific goals, individuals can stay motivated and avoid distractions. It is also important to break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks, and to track progress regularly.<br /><br />Another strategy is to establish routines and habits that support discipline. For instance, establishing a regular exercise routine or a daily meditation practice can help individuals develop the self-discipline needed to maintain these habits over time. Additionally, creating a structured schedule for work or study can help individuals to manage their time effectively and avoid procrastination.<br /><br />It is also important to cultivate a growth mindset, which emphasizes the importance of effort, persistence, and learning from mistakes. Individuals with a growth mindset are more likely to view challenges as opportunities for growth and improvement, rather than as obstacles to be avoided.<br /><br />Finally, discipline can be developed through the support of others. Friends, family, and mentors can provide encouragement, accountability, and guidance to help individuals stay on track and achieve their goals.<br /><br />In conclusion, discipline is an essential aspect of human life that contributes to personal growth, social harmony, and societal well-being. It helps individuals to achieve their goals, develop self-control, and contribute to the greater good. While cultivating discipline can be challenging, there are several strategies that individuals can use to develop this essential trait. By setting clear goals, establishing routines, cultivating a growth mindset, and seeking support from others, individuals can develop the discipline needed to lead successful and fulfilling lives.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Women’s Day is celebrated on 8th March every year to commemorate the achievements of women in various fields. It is a day to recognize and celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women all over the world. This day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity. </p><p></p><p>The history of International Women’s Day dates back to 1909 when it was first observed in New York City by 15,000 women who marched through the city demanding better pay, shorter working hours and voting rights. Since then it has been celebrated annually as a way of recognizing the progress made towards achieving gender equality and empowering women around the world. </p><p></p><p>Gender inequality is still prevalent in many parts of the world today despite significant progress being made towards achieving gender parity over recent decades. Women are still underrepresented in leadership positions across all sectors including politics, business and academia; they are paid less than men for doing similar work; they face discrimination based on their sex or marital status; they are more likely to be victims of violence or abuse; and they often lack access to education or healthcare services that would enable them to reach their full potential. </p><p></p><p>International Women’s Day provides an opportunity for us all – both men and women – to reflect on these issues and take action towards creating a more equal society where everyone can thrive regardless of their gender identity or background. We can start by challenging stereotypes about what roles men and women should play in society, encouraging girls into STEM subjects at school so that they have access to higher-paying jobs later on in life, supporting female entrepreneurs who are trying to break into male-dominated industries such as tech or finance, advocating for equal pay between genders at work places etcetera . </p><p></p><p>We must also remember that International Women’s Day isn’t just about celebrating female achievement but also about recognizing how far we still have left go before true equality is achieved between genders worldwide . We must continue our efforts towards creating an environment where everyone has equal opportunities regardless of their sex , race , religion , sexual orientation etcetera . Only then will we be able create a truly inclusive society where everyone can reach their full potential without fear or prejudice . </p><p></p><p>In conclusion , International Women's Day serves as an important reminder that there is still much work left do if we want achieve true gender equality worldwide . It provides us with an opportunity reflect upon our own actions - both individually collectively -and take steps towards creating a fairer more equitable society where everyone can thrive regardless of who they are . Let us use this day not only celebrate female achievement but also commit ourselves making sure that no one ever feels discriminated against because their sex race religion sexual orientation etcetera</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Hindu and Buddhist perspectives on suffering are similar in that they both believe that suffering is caused by our attachment to things that are impermanent. However, they differ in how they view the role of suffering in our lives. Hindus believe that suffering is a necessary part of life that can help us to grow and become closer to God. Buddhists, on the other hand, believe that suffering is caused by our ignorance and can be alleviated by our own efforts.</p><p></p><p>Both Hinduism and Buddhism teach that attachment to things that are impermanent is the root cause of suffering. This is because everything in the world is subject to change and will eventually come to an end. When we become attached to things, we are setting ourselves up for disappointment and pain when they eventually change or disappear. The only way to truly avoid suffering is to let go of our attachments.</p><p></p><p>Hindus believe that suffering is a necessary part of life that can help us to grow and become closer to God. Hindus see suffering as a way to purify our souls and to test our faith. By enduring suffering, we can become stronger and more resilient people. Additionally, Hindus believe that suffering can help us to develop compassion for others.</p><p></p><p>Buddhists, on the other hand, believe that suffering is caused by our ignorance and can be alleviated by our own efforts. Buddhists see suffering as a result of our mistaken beliefs about the way things are. We suffer because we think that things are permanent when they are not, and because we think that we are separate from others when we are not. If we can understand the true nature of reality, we can see that suffering is not necessary. We can also take steps to reduce our suffering, such as by practicing compassion and mindfulness.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, both Hinduism and Buddhism view suffering as caused by our attachment to things that are impermanent. However, they differ in how they see the role of suffering in our lives. Hindus believe that suffering is a necessary part of life that can help us to grow and become closer to God. Buddhists, on the other hand, believe that suffering is caused by our ignorance and can be alleviated by our own efforts.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Pa </strong><strong>brainliest </strong><strong>naman </strong><strong>po </strong><strong>:</strong><strong>(</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>Media is considered as one of the most powerful tools in providing information to people or in society. Media is part of our daily lives. It informs, influences, and entertains us. Not only they inform us, they have also the capability in shaping our lives.</p><p> Advertisements shown on television or even in the internet can affect the viewers. Some contains violence, nudity or anything that is inappropriate to the viewers who are children or under age. They might think the information on that certain advertisement is correct without proper guidance from the parents. In the internet, there is no censorship when it comes to information resulting to some users to take this as an advantage to spread false information all over the web. That is the reason that there are some users who were victimized by scammers, bullies and etc. Medias has biases also. They have the power to manipulate thus making viewers to believe on the information they insinuate. But all of those negativities written above can be abide. Parents must be vigilant on what their children are watching. They must ensure that it is age appropriate. Users in the internet must check the authenticity of the information. They must check the origin of it to avoid fallacy. Never post something too personal like bank numbers, address or any that might put you in jeopardy. Always consider one’s privacy. In detecting biases in media, look for the sources if it involves political perspectives. Check if the headline and actual article matches. Sometimes it contains double standards. Look who’s point of view is the article is written and find alternate point of views . Biased information tries to change your mind so as an individual we must not believe immediately.   </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The increased use of digital media is changing people’s everyday lives and the way they connect and collaborate in the broader societal context, at work and in civil society. Much of the impact of this heightened use is beneficial to both individuals and society. It is enabling unprecedented levels of communication, social interaction and community building across boundaries of time, place and social context. It is enabling individuals and speeding up the democratization of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>But not all the impacts of increased use of digital media are positive. Research indicates that when humans excessively use digital media it can negatively influence their cognitive and behavioural development and even their mental and physical health. Hyperconnectivity, the increasing digital interconnection of people and things, has the potential to change patterns of social interaction, as face-to-face time may be substituted by online interaction.</p><p></p><p>Whether individuals see the impact of increased digital media use as positive or negative depends greatly on where they live. Clearly, it is important to understand the opportunities and the risks in increased digital media usage, so that both industry and users can learn how best to exploit the benefits while mitigating the negative effects.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Pakibrainliest naman po. </strong></p><br />
