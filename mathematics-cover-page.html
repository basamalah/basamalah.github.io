                                            The Association of Mathematics Teachers had organized a seminar for mathematics teachers in your region. The theme of the seminar is on conic sections and their application to real life. Inclusive of the registration fee are meals and snacks, a program, training kits, and a T-shirt. The association desires to come up with a common computer-generated graphics design for the front cover page of the program, tarpaulin for the stage, and the T-shirts. The details of the design feature the equations and graphs of conic sections, and their practical applications to life situations. You are one of the famous designer/graphic artists in your province. Knowing your expertise in mathematics, you were contracted by the association to create a design for each of the three mentioned aspects of the seminar. 
Conic Sections as T-shirt Design
Task/s:
1. Create a sketch/draft of your design containing characteristics (graphs, equations, properties) of any conic sections. 
2. The design should include the title of the seminar, theme, date, and venue. You are free to position the text with respect to the design that you have created,
3. There should be at most five colors used in the design.
4. Output must be in a long bond paper.</a>

                                            3. I was nervous about going to Pat's birthday party that day. I was afraid that there was no one there that I knew of and I did not want to be left out of place, especially then that I expected Pat would be busy with her guests so I said to Mother, "Mother, I do not want to go the party)". My mother furrowed her brow and said, "What is wrong with you, Debbie? We made a promise to Pat that we would be there. In fact, we already have the present and we need to give that to her". But I shook my head hard; I still would not want to go. At last, Mother put her hands on mine and I could not do anything. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 4. Jon-jon examined his mathematics book. It had been badly treated. The cover was torn and some pages were missing. Still, Jon-jon was convinced that looks were less important than utility. He had learned that lesson long ago. "Thanks, Mr. Castor". He said with gratitude. Mr. Castor looked up from his desk and said, "Sorry, we do not have new books yet, but there's plenty of good math left in that book."Mr. Thompson smiled that Jon-jon fell appreciative. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hands and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will be probably feel happy that you are actively taking part in the lesson. THEME: POINT OF VIEW:​​</a>

                                            3. I was nervous about going to Pat's birthday party that day. I was afraid that there was no one there that I knew of and I did not want to be left out of place, especially then that I expected Pat would be busy with her guests so I said to Mother, "Mother, I do not want to go the party)". My mother furrowed her brow and said, "What is wrong with you, Debbie? We made a promise to Pat that we would be there. In fact, we already have the present and we need to give that to her". But I shook my head hard; I still would not want to go. At last, Mother put her hands on mine and I could not do anything. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 4. Jon-jon examined his mathematics book. It had been badly treated. The cover was torn and some pages were missing. Still, Jon-jon was convinced that looks were less important than utility. He had learned that lesson long ago. "Thanks, Mr. Castor". He said with gratitude. Mr. Castor looked up from his desk and said, "Sorry, we do not have new books yet, but there's plenty of good math left in that book."Mr. Thompson smiled that Jon-jon fell appreciative. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 5. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hands and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will be probably feel happy that you are actively taking part in the lesson. THEME: POINT OFVIEW:​</a>

                            3. The Association of Mathematics Teachers had organized a seminar for mathematics teachers in your region. The theme of the seminar is on conic sections and their application to real life. Inclusive of the registration fee are meals and snacks, a program, training kits, and a T-shirt. The association desires to come up with a common computer-generated graphics design for the front cover page of the program, tarpaulin for the stage, and the T-shirts. The details of the design feature the equations and graphs of conic sections, and their practical applications to life situations. You are one of the famous designer/graphic artists in your province. Knowing your expertise in mathematics, you were contracted by the association to create a design for each of the three mentioned aspects of the seminar. 
Conic Sections as T-shirt Design
Task/s:
1. Create a sketch/draft of your design containing characteristics (graphs, equations, properties) of any conic sections. 
2. The design should include the title of the seminar, theme, date, and venue. You are free to position the text with respect to the design that you have created,
3. There should be at most five colors used in the design.
4. Output must be in a long bond paper.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Key Points
</p><p>A conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane; the three types are parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas.
</p><p>A conic section can be graphed on a coordinate plane.
</p><p>Every conic section has certain features, including at least one focus and directrix. Parabolas have one focus and directrix, while ellipses and hyperbolas have two of each.
</p><p>A conic section is the set of points  </p><p>P
</p><p> whose
</p><p>distance to the focus is a constant multiple of the distance from  </p><p>P
</p><p> to the directrix of the conic.
</p><p>Key Terms
</p><p>vertex: An extreme point on a conic section.
</p><p>asymptote: A straight line which a curve approaches arbitrarily closely as it goes to infinity.
</p><p>locus: The set of all points whose coordinates satisfy a given equation or condition.
</p><p>focus: A point used to construct and define a conic section, at which rays reflected from the curve converge (plural: foci).
</p><p>nappe: One half of a double cone.
</p><p>conic section: Any curve formed by the intersection of a plane with a cone of two nappes.
</p><p>directrix: A line used to construct and define a conic section; a parabola has one directrix; ellipses and hyperbolas have two (plural: directrices).</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            12. 3. I was nervous about going to Pat's birthday party that day. I was afraid that there was no one there that I knew of and I did not want to be left out of place, especially then that I expected Pat would be busy with her guests so I said to Mother, "Mother, I do not want to go the party)". My mother furrowed her brow and said, "What is wrong with you, Debbie? We made a promise to Pat that we would be there. In fact, we already have the present and we need to give that to her". But I shook my head hard; I still would not want to go. At last, Mother put her hands on mine and I could not do anything. THEME: POINT OF VIEW: 4. Jon-jon examined his mathematics book. It had been badly treated. The cover was torn and some pages were missing. Still, Jon-jon was convinced that looks were less important than utility. He had learned that lesson long ago. "Thanks, Mr. Castor". He said with gratitude. Mr. Castor looked up from his desk and said, "Sorry, we do not have new books yet, but there's plenty of good math left in that book."Mr. Thompson smiled that Jon-jon fell appreciative.
