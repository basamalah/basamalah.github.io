                                            I Will Do This Direction: Below are the concepts related to Socialization. You have to read and understand these concepts and answer the activities afterwards, Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. Conflict Perspective An interactionist studying socialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication. For example, dressing baby boys in blue and baby girls in pink is one small way we convey messages about differences in gender roles. Symbolic Interactionism​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Structural Concepts:</p><p>In the social sciences, the concept of structure refers to the underlying organization or pattern of social relationships and institutions that shape social behavior and outcomes. Social structure encompasses both formal institutions (such as governments, corporations, and educational systems) and informal patterns of social organization (such as social networks and cultural norms).</p><p>1.1 Social Structure vs. Social Function:</p><p>Social structure and social function are closely related concepts, but they refer to different aspects of social organization. Social structure refers to the underlying patterns of relationships and institutions that shape social behavior, while social function refers to the role that these patterns play in maintaining social order and promoting social stability. In other words, social structure refers to the "what" of social organization, while social function refers to the "why".</p><p></p><p>1.2 Structural Functionalism vs. Marxism:</p><p>Structural functionalism and Marxism are two competing theoretical approaches to understanding social structure and social change. Structural functionalism emphasizes the role of social institutions in maintaining social order and stability, while Marxism focuses on the ways in which social inequality and conflict arise from the economic and political structures of society. While both approaches share an interest in understanding how social structure shapes social behavior, they have fundamentally different views on the nature of social change and the role of social institutions in promoting social welfare.</p><p></p><p>1.3 Manifest and Latent Function and Dysfunction:</p><p>Manifest functions are the intended and recognized consequences of social institutions or practices, while latent functions are the unintended and often unrecognized consequences of these same institutions or practices. Dysfunction refers to the negative consequences of social institutions or practices that undermine their intended functions. For example, the manifest function of a school is to educate students, but a latent function may be the formation of social networks among students. A dysfunction of the school system might be high dropout rates.</p><p></p><p>Marxism:</p><p>Marxism is a social, political, and economic theory developed by Karl Marx that emphasizes the role of economic and political institutions in shaping social behavior and outcomes. Marx argued that the capitalist system was inherently exploitative, with capitalists profiting from the labor of workers while keeping wages low. He believed that social change would come about through the overthrow of capitalist institutions by the working class, leading to a socialist society in which the means of production are owned collectively.</p><p></p><p>Rational Choice Theory:</p><p>Rational choice theory is a social science approach that seeks to explain social behavior in terms of individual rationality and self-interest. This theory assumes that individuals make decisions based on a rational calculation of the costs and benefits associated with different options. Rational choice theory has been applied to a wide range of social phenomena, including voting behavior, criminal behavior, and economic decision-making. Critics of rational choice theory argue that it oversimplifies complex social phenomena and ignores the role of social norms, emotions, and other factors in shaping individual behavior.</p><br />

You have to read and understand these concepts and answer the activities afterwards, Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. Sociologists recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal development Scholars are using these three major theoretical paradigms to approach this topic. Sociological Perspective on Socialization . • Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new generations. Without socialization, a society's culture would perish as members died off. Structural Functionalism • A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example, individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in Chris Langan's case, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. Conflict Perspective An interactionist studying socialization is concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication. For example, dressing baby boys in blue and baby girls in pink is one small way we convey messages about differences in gender roles. Symbolic Interactionism​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Structural Functionalism is a sociological perspective that emphasizes the interdependence of society and the interconnectedness of its parts. It views society as a complex system made up of various institutions and social structures that function together to maintain social stability and order.</p><p>1.1. Social structure refers to the patterns of relationships, roles, and institutions that make up society, while social functions refer to the beneficial consequences of these social structures for society as a whole.</p><p></p><p>1.2. Marxism and Structural Functionalism are both macro-level perspectives that analyze society as a whole. While Structural Functionalism emphasizes the interdependence of social structures and institutions for social stability, Marxism emphasizes the economic and power imbalances between social classes as the main driver of social change.</p><p></p><p>1.3. Manifest functions are the intended and recognized consequences of social structures, while latent functions are the unintended and often unrecognized consequences. Dysfunction refers to the negative consequences of a social structure or institution.</p><p></p><p>Karl Marx's theory of Marxism emphasizes the importance of social class and the struggle for power and resources between the ruling class and the working class. He argued that the capitalist economic system exploits workers and perpetuates inequality.</p><p></p><p>Rational Choice Theory is a social science theory that explains social behavior in terms of individual actors making rational choices based on their preferences and goals.</p><p></p><p>3.1. The assumptions of Rational Choice Theory include the idea that individuals act rationally to maximize their self-interest, individuals have well-defined preferences and goals, and individuals have complete and accurate information.</p><p></p><p>3.2. The concepts of Rational Choice Theory include utility, rationality, preferences, constraints, and choices. Utility refers to the satisfaction individuals derive from the choices they make, while rationality refers to the consistency of an individual's choices with their preferences and goals.</p><p></p><p>3.3. The rationality and intelligibility of Rational Choice Theory lie in its ability to explain individual behavior in terms of individual decision-making. However, critics argue that it does not fully account for social norms, values, and cultural factors that shape individual behavior.</p><p></p><p>Sigmund Freud was a psychologist who developed the theory of psychoanalysis, which emphasizes the importance of unconscious processes and childhood experiences in shaping behavior.</p><p>4.1. Freud proposed that the human mind can be divided into three levels: the conscious, the preconscious, and the unconscious. The conscious level includes thoughts and experiences that are currently in an individual's awareness, while the preconscious level includes thoughts and experiences that can be easily brought into awareness. The unconscious level includes thoughts and experiences that are repressed and inaccessible to conscious awareness.</p><p></p><p>George Herbert Mead was a sociologist who developed the theory of symbolic interactionism, which emphasizes the importance of social interaction and meaning-making in shaping individual behavior and society.</p><p>5.1. Mead's concept of the self is based on the idea that individuals develop a sense of self through social interaction and the use of symbols. He argued that the self is not innate but is developed through a process of socialization that involves learning and internalizing cultural symbols and norms.</p><p></p><p>5.2. Structural Functionalism, Marxism, Symbolic Interactionism, Psychoanalysis, and Rational Choice Theory can be connected by their common focus on understanding and explaining social behavior and society. They are all part of the larger field of social sciences, which seeks to analyze and understand human behavior and social structures.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa brainliest naman </p><br />
