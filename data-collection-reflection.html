                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Quantitative research measures attitudes, behaviours, opinions and other variables to support or reject a premise. This is done by collecting numerical data, which is easily quantifiable to identify statistical significance. Bias is less likely to occur in quantitative analysis, as the data are statistic in nature. Meaning there is less room for a researcher’s subjective reasoning to effect results also it is easier to analyze than its qualitative counterpart. Plus, if you’re using online survey software, you can apply filters for a more in-depth view of your data. </p><p></p><p>With all of its positivity, Quantitative data is excellent at providing answers to what, who and when questions. But isn’t great for how and why questions.  Qualitative research is a better option for exploring participant experiences and opinions. Combining thise research method with quantitative data provides more context to participant answers.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>To read and learn more about this topic, you may click the following links below: #BRAINLYFAST</p>Researcher’s involvement to the research meaning : https://brainly.ph/question/1291730Research about research : https://brainly.ph/question/1509287<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Quantitative research measures attitudes, behaviours, opinions and other variables to support or reject a premise. This is done by collecting numerical data, which is easily quantifiable to identify statistical significance. Bias is less likely to occur in quantitative analysis, as the data are statistic in nature. Meaning there is less room for a researcher’s subjective reasoning to effect results also it is easier to analyze than its qualitative counterpart. Plus, if you’re using online survey software, you can apply filters for a more in-depth view of your data.</p><p></p><p>With all of its positivity, Quantitative data is excellent at providing answers to what, who and when questions. But isn’t great for how and why questions.  Qualitative research is a better option for exploring participant experiences and opinions. Combining thise research method with quantitative data provides more context to participant answers.</p><br />
