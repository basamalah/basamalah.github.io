                                            The Value of Peopleby Jim JohnsonWhen I worked as an errand boy at a big store, a rich lady came in and bought a veryexpensive Chinese vase. As I went off to deliver it, the boss gave me a stern warning to beextra careful. I found the lady's mansion, and just as I was squeezing in through a half-opengate, I heard something break inside the parcel. I went pale with fear. I wanted to run awayJust then the large mansion door opened and an elderly lady came out I was veryworried about what I was going to tell her, when suddenly a large playful shepherd dog camebounding across the lawn and jumping right on top of me, knocking the vase to the ground witha smashing sound. The lady came hurrying over, while the dog licked my face. Excitedly, sheasked, "For heaven's sake, lad, I hope you're not hurt."And then I started, "About the vase, I just wanted to tell you..." But I never got to say it"Oh, the vase?" she said. "That's nothing to worry about... But how about you? Youknow, that dog is still young and probably thought you wanted to play with him... Are youalright?"Well, she gave me a good tip for bringing the vase. And I patted the dog on the head. Hehad been my savior.I can never forget that lady, who thought more about me than that valuable vase.Learning Task:Directions. Answer the following questions below. Write your answer on the line.1.

                                            Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</a>

As I went off to deliver it, the boss gave me a stern warning to beextra careful. I found the lady's mansion, and just as I was squeezing in through a half-opengate, I heard something break inside the parcel. I went pale with fear. I wanted to run awayJust then the large mansion door opened and an elderly lady came out I was veryworried about what I was going to tell her, when suddenly a large playful shepherd dog camebounding across the lawn and jumping right on top of me, knocking the vase to the ground witha smashing sound. The lady came hurrying over, while the dog licked my face. Excitedly, sheasked, "For heaven's sake, lad, I hope you're not hurt."And then I started, "About the vase, I just wanted to tell you..." But I never got to say it"Oh, the vase?" she said. "That's nothing to worry about... But how about you? Youknow, that dog is still young and probably thought you wanted to play with him... Are youalright?"Well, she gave me a good tip for bringing the vase. And I patted the dog on the head. Hehad been my savior.I can never forget that lady, who thought more about me than that valuable vase.Learning Task:Directions. Answer the following questions below. Write your answer on the line.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CONSTELLATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>constellation</strong> is a region on the divine circle where a gathering of noticeable stars frames an apparent framework or example, commonly addressing a creature, legendary individual or animal, or a lifeless thing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The beginnings of the most punctual <strong>constellations </strong>probably return to ancient times. Individuals utilized them to relate accounts of their convictions, encounters, creation, or folklore. Various societies and nations embraced their own <strong>constellations</strong>, some of which endured into the mid twentieth century before the present <strong>constellations </strong>were universally perceived. The acknowledgment of <strong>constellations</strong> has changed altogether after some time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became famous, just to drop into lack of definition. Some were restricted to a solitary culture or country.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 48 conventional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Peculiarities and Ptolemy's Almagest, however their starting point presumably originates before these works by a few centuries. <strong>Constellations</strong> in the far southern sky were added from the fifteenth century until the mid-eighteenth century when European wayfarers started going toward the Southern Half of the globe. Twelve old <strong>constellations </strong>have a place with the zodiac. The beginnings of the zodiac remain generally dubious; its mysterious divisions became noticeable c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean cosmology.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is a constellation? - Brainly.ph

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p><p></p><br />

                            22. Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
