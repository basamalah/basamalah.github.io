THE GRADUATE The smell of the com about to be harvested kept still in the air on that Saturday night. Armando continued walking along the fields formed by his father. At last, he is now back home after seven years. He graduated as a civil engineer from a famous University in Manila, passed the board exam and was hired as a consultant in a big construction company. Engineer Armando Corpuz- the first one on their remote barangay. His parents and two brothers sacrificed a lot for him and they succeeded. Now, it is time for him to return the favor. He will finance the studies of his two younger brothers in any private school they want. He will build a big concrete house for their family and give them a big amount of money for them to start any business. Ahh! God is very good to them for their faith and perseverance. 1.

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>
