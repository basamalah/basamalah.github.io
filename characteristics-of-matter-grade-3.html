                                            ask 2 Some characteristics of a good research title may be observed in the given examples. Read the following guidelines in constructing a research title to help you create your own: • Make the title specific enough to describe the contents of the paper, but not so technical that only specialists will understand. The title should be appropriate for the intended audience. ● The title usually describes the subject matter of the article. For example: Effect of Smoking on Academic Performance. • Sometimes a title that summarizes the results is more effective. Example: Students Who Smoke Get Lower Grades. Titles with colons are currently in vogue but usually they are not as cute as you think they are when you first think of them. Directions: Choose a social issue from your list on Activity 1 and following the guidelines mentioned above, create your proposed titles for your research report.
