Write the results of your critical evaluation on the spaces provided. ABSTRACT The crucial role of language in the improvement of man’s critical thinking in this era of globalization, multiculturalism, knowledge explosion, or modern technology prodded several professionals, academicians, and graduate -school students to conduct research studies on language teaching and learning specifically, on language theories and pedagogical practices related to communicative approach and functional grammar. (Freeman &amp;Anderson, 2012).One modern grammar theory this study assumed as the theoretical underpinning of any language teaching and learning methodology that zeroes in on critical thinking, a higher -order thinking strategy that every nation in this contemporary world needs to progress economically and politically, is the SFG or System Functional Grammar. The results showed that the ideas behind the Systematic Functional Grammar were likewise the ones applied in language teaching and learning activities infusing critical thinking. The SFG concepts : (1) multi-functionality of clauses, (2) grammar structures linked with communicative functions, (3) interactive activities, (4) contextualized exercises, (5) stressed macro-function of language, (6) exercises giving wide latitude of choice and, (7) use of discourse as the dominant language structure would trigger off critical -thinking acts like: comparing, classifying, patterning, planning, critiquing, hypothesizing, and reasoning inductively or deductively. (Bloor 1995; Eggins 1994; Halliday 1994, 2004, 2009) Validating the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and reasonable or logical thinkers for global progress is the contribution of this paper to the field of language teaching and learning.

Write the results of your critical evaluation on the spaces provided. ABSTRACT The crucial role of language in the improvement of man’s critical thinking in this era of globalization, multiculturalism, knowledge explosion, or modern technology prodded several professionals, academicians, and graduate -school students to conduct research studies on language teaching and learning specifically, on language theories and pedagogical practices related to communicative approach and functional grammar. (Freeman &amp;Anderson, 2012).One modern grammar theory this study assumed as the theoretical underpinning of any language teaching and learning methodology that zeroes in on critical thinking, a higher -order thinking strategy that every nation in this contemporary world needs to progress economically and politically, is the SFG or System Functional Grammar. The results showed that the ideas behind the Systematic Functional Grammar were likewise the ones applied in language teaching and learning activities infusing critical thinking. The SFG concepts : (1) multi-functionality of clauses, (2) grammar structures linked with communicative functions, (3) interactive activities, (4) contextualized exercises, (5) stressed macro-function of language, (6) exercises giving wide latitude of choice and, (7) use of discourse as the dominant language structure would trigger off critical -thinking acts like: comparing, classifying, patterning, planning, critiquing, hypothesizing, and reasoning inductively or deductively. (Bloor 1995; Eggins 1994; Halliday 1994, 2004, 2009) Validating the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and reasonable or logical thinkers for global progress is the contribution of this paper to the field of language teaching and learning. Evaluation:​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>The abstract of this research paper appears to be in keeping with the concepts of abstract writing in that it provides a clear overview of the research study and its findings. It clearly states the purpose of the study, which is to investigate the role of language in improving critical thinking through the use of the Systematic Functional Grammar (SFG) theory. The abstract also includes a summary of the key findings, which is that the SFG concepts and language teaching and learning activities can trigger critical thinking skills such as comparing, classifying, patterning, and reasoning. Finally, the abstract specifies the contribution of the paper to the field of language teaching and learning, which is the validation of the impact of the SFG theory on developing excellent communicators and logical thinkers for global progress.</strong></p><br />
