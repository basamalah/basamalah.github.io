                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Having studied industrial engineering at the University of Lima, Carolina Ward decided to begin her very own business in the hope it would make others happy – a chocolate start-up business named, Conciencia.
</p><p>
</p><p>In total admiration of Peru’s natural resources, Carolina hopes to educate chocolate lovers around the world about Peru’s rich biodiversity and what it can offer when it comes to raw, organic chocolate products.  </p><p>
</p><p>Going from industrial engineering student to chocolate business founder is an interesting route – but Carolina most definitely has her reasons.
</p><p>
</p><p>“The challenge was to combine the rigid, intellectual, and analytical side of industrial engineering that I had with the human aspect, directed toward healthy living, nutrition, and physical and spiritual well-being,” said Carolina.
</p><p>
</p><p>Carolina frequently travels to the Amazon rainforest in order to educate and train farmers to grow raw cacao in the best way possible. Her small team includes a clinical nutritionist who helps Carolina and her business partner develop new recipes using additional superfoods and ingredients.
</p><p>
</p><p>“The idea is to break the cliché that chocolate makes you fat and gives you acne, because it doesn’t. If made properly, it can be very healthy.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Not only do we produce chocolate, we also promote a conscious lifestyle,” explained Carolina.
</p><p>
</p><p>Working together with a non-governmental organization that runs after-school programs for school children, Carolina hosts her own educational workshops to do just that. From learning about the importance of sustainability of a business to understanding nutrition and what it takes to make the chocolate, she hopes it’s a positive way of giving back to the community that made her feel welcome.
</p><p>
</p><p>In July this year, Conciencia won five awards at the International Chocolate Awards in Peru.
</p><p>
</p><p>And when it comes to her experience at the University of Lima and how it shaped her into the person she is today, Carolina is beyond grateful – from making use of the university’s very own Fab Lab in order to create prototype molds for her business logo, to the help and support of the professors.  </p><p>
</p><p>“The program awakened my curiosity and allowed me to understand how things work,” she said.
</p><p>
</p><p>“Although I’m not an expert on agricultural engineering, I’ve learned a lot about such subject and that’s been thanks to the undergraduate program.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Since graduating, Carolina has been invited back to the University of Lima to give talks on start-ups and her own experience.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The young parent...</p><p>Navigating college life while fresh out of high school can be a challenge, especially at a large university. When you add the responsibilities of being a parent to that challenge, it is easy to see how some might struggle. ; Nursing student Krystl Taylor learned all about that experience when she first enrolled in college.</p><p></p><p>“I was one of the few students married with kids,” Taylor says. “I felt kind of alone because there weren’t a lot of students that could relate to my life.” ; </p><p>Taylor eventually left the larger state school for Rasmussen College, where the flexibility of online classes eased the logistical issues that come with raising a family and attending school.</p><p></p><p>The staff has also gone above and beyond to provide her with the one-on-one support that was lacking at her previous school—one instructor even provided her with a walk through of a subject late on a Saturday night. Taylor graduated in 2014, thanks in part to that support. The significance in graduating isn’t just the degree, but the example she has set for her children.</p><p></p><p>“I want my kids to know the importance of getting an education and chasing their dreams and goals,” Taylor says.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In this success story, we will share with you the biography of the great inventor and German-born scientist “Albert Einstein”. His name becomes synonymous with the great word “Genius” and his great Einstein equation E=mc2 has been studied by many students of the world each year. He is one of the best and smart physicists who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. In this article, you will be able to learn much more about the successful life of the great physicist, philosopher, amateur musician, theologian and lifelong pacifist in detail.</p><p>The great scientist and physician “Albert Einstein” were born in the city of “Ulm, in Wurtermerg, Germany on March 14, 1879. The parents of Einstein lived in a world having no electric light. He was born when Thomas Edison invented the electric bulb.</p><p>Einstein began speaking late when he was only 3-year old. The parents of Albert Einstein want to see their son become a doctor. But they were so worried about the developmental issue of their child.</p><p>As a student, he didn’t show any remarkable results. The grades were only passing. He was renowned and top students in Mathematics and science only.</p><p>At the age of 16, he was determined to take admission in electrical engineering. But instead of electrical engineering, he entered in ETH Zurich Polytechnic at a 4-year program of teaching in mathematics and physics. He always skipped classes because he didn’t like to attend classes. He always presents in beer halls and coffee houses.</p><p>To pass exams, he copied all class notes from “Marcel Grossmann” that got him remarkable grades in group transcending Grossmann too.</p><p>He passed exams and obtained his degree along with teaching diploma in physics and Mathematics. He then starts working as a professor’s assistance, but no one accepts due to rebellious character.</p><p>After graduation, he searched for the job until he started working as an assistant examiner at the “Federal office for Intellectual Property” in Bern, Switzerland. Einstein was responsible for the evaluation of the patent submission for many inventions.</p><p>In 1902, along with new friends Maurice Solovine and Conard Habicht, Einstein met in Bern. Here they organized a small group “The Olympia Academy”. The discussion group plays a vital role in the development of the intellectual ability of Einstein.</p><p>The class at Swiss “Federal Polytechnic Institute: was small and only consists of five students only. Only one female student named “Mileva Maric” who romantically involved with Einstein and got married on 6, January 1903. Their daughter “Lieserl” was born in Novi Sad in 1902, whose destiny is still unexplored. Either their daughter adopted or maybe died of Scarlet fever during infancy.</p><p>On 14, May 1904, Maric gave birth to their first son named “Hans Albert Einstein”. The birth of his son never distracts him from his incredible scientific career.</p><p>According to Einstein’s biographers, the year 1905 called “Miracle year”. In 1900, physics was distributed into two main branches. One was mechanics that was represented by Isaac Newton and the other was Electromagnetism represented by James Clark Maxwell.</p><p>1905 is the year known as Miracle year or Annus Mirabilis (In Latin) for Albert Einstein. The main reason for this year was that Einstein wrote 4-papers that were printed in the Scientific journal “Annalen der Physik”. This paper contributed to the amazing work of modern physics and change the point of view of people on time, mass, space and energy. These papers presented the concept of Photoelectric effect, mass-energy equivalence, special theory of relativity and Brownian motion.</p><p>In 1907, he gave the concept of gravity. According to him, gravity is equivalent to the accelerated motion. His image as a scientist had been improved and he was invited to present lectures at one of the popular universities in the world named “University of Bern”.</p><p>He resigned from the position at the patent office, he was appointed an associate professor in 1909 at the University of Zurich. He changed his appearance and wore baggy short trousers with an indifferent hairstyle. He was very informal, and any student could easily interrupt him anytime. The student spends most of their time with him in different cafes and also at his own home.</p><p>In April 1911, he worked as a full professor at “German Charles-Ferdinand University” and get the Austrian citizenship in the Empire of Austro-Hungarian. He wrote 11 papers at university. 5 of them were on radiation mathematics and the quantum theory of solids.</p><p>In 1912, Einstein visited Berlin. Here he met with cousin “Elsa Lowenthal”. Mileva his first wife suffered from depression and left home with two sons. The marriage of Albert and Mileva ended badly. </p><p></p><p></p><p>full sana na answer pero d na kasya po ei</p><br />
