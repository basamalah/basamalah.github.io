                                            Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

                            10. Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

We must do something to stop the Earth's further destruction.C. We must stop all the activities that destructs the environment and do something to save it.D.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. C</p><p>2. B</p><p>3. A</p><p>4. C</p><p>5. A.</p><p>6. C.</p><p>7. A or D</p><p>8. C</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Environmental destruction, since it emphasizes the types of pollutions in the environment.</p><p>2.. The lines depict air pollution, with the stars and the blue skies not seen clearly as the biggest hint.</p><p>3.. The lines depict water pollution, since it is obviously stated in the first line, and with the ocean floors getting contaminated.</p><p>4. Deforestation is depicted in the third stanza, since it is mentioned that "paper joined pollution's team", and papers are made from trees that have been cut down; hence, deforestation.</p><p>5. The answer is the explanation.</p><p>6. The lines are metaphorical. The first line instructs us to do a better job at preserving the environment and that is through building eco-friendly organizations, realizing programs that serve the protection of the environment, and planting a seed that is an idea or, better yet, a practice that would further the betterment and integration of the environment. The second line instructs us to abolish old activities that are the root cause of environmental destruction in the first place.</p><p>7. Letter a is a general answer, while letter D is specific. Nonetheless, both answers convey the same meaning, which is to protect and take care of our environment.</p><p>8. I am not certain with this answer; however, I am certain that it could fit the poem, since it depicts pollution and how it remains to be perpetuated by us humans. We do not and cannot progress to a society with better environment, because we have not changed at all. Should we change our actions and take initiative of changing the environment (i.e. through cleaning the dirty waters, stop littering, ceasing factory dumps, etc.), progress is possible. But those who remain insensitive to the environment's needs remain as stagnant as frozen meat.</p><br />
