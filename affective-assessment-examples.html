                                            Explain the ff:
• Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline. This is important since an entire system or operation and all the stakeholders of an  institution or organization are at stake. Without scientific basis, someone may be affected or may suffer. For example, in the field of medicine, a new drug must first be tested to determine its efficacy in curing sickness before it can actually be prescribed.
• Research is undertaken for the continuous development and further productivity in any field. Any system that will be utilized in any organization must first be tried to determine its value and it must be better than the previous system used. Simply, research is the result am of advancing knowledge from the past.
• Research helps develop tools for assessing effectiveness of any practice and operation such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, psychological assessments, among others.
This importance of research is observed in behavioral science and physical science, among others.

The business will initially focus on producing piglets for sale to other farmers, with plans to expand into pork production in the future.</p><p></p><p>Technical Analysis:</p><p>The technical feasibility of the project will be assessed by evaluating the availability of land, facilities, and equipment needed for the swine production operations. This will include assessing the availability of suitable breeding stock, housing and feeding equipment, and veterinary services. The technical analysis will also evaluate the environmental impact of the project and determine the best practices for waste management and biosecurity.</p><p></p><p>Market Analysis:</p><p>The market analysis will assess the demand for piglets and pork products in the local and regional markets. This will include analyzing the current and future trends in the swine industry, the size and growth rate of the market, and the competition. The market analysis will also identify potential customers, such as other farmers and meat processing companies.</p><p></p><p>Financial Analysis:</p><p>The financial analysis will evaluate the feasibility of the project by estimating the start-up costs, operating expenses, and projected revenues. This will include analyzing the costs of land, facilities, equipment, labor, and feed. The financial analysis will also project the expected revenue from the sale of piglets and pork products, and evaluate the profitability and return on investment of the project.</p><p></p><p>Legal Analysis:</p><p>The legal analysis will review the legal and regulatory requirements for setting up and operating a swine production business. This will include obtaining necessary permits and licenses, complying with animal welfare and environmental regulations, and meeting food safety and labeling requirements.</p><p></p><p>Risk Assessment:</p><p>The risk assessment will identify and assess the potential risks and challenges that may impact the success of the project. This will include identifying potential diseases that may affect the swine herd, assessing the impact of natural disasters, and evaluating the potential for market volatility. The risk assessment will also identify strategies for mitigating these risks, such as implementing biosecurity measures and diversifying the product line.</p><p></p><p>Overall, conducting a feasibility study for a swine production business will help assess the viability of the project and identify potential risks and challenges. The study will provide a roadmap for the project's development and help ensure its success.</p><br />

• Research provides a scientific basis for any practice or methodology in any field or discipline. This is important since an entire system or operation and all the stakeholders of an  institution or organization are at stake. Without scientific basis, someone may be affected or may suffer. For example, in the field of medicine, a new drug must first be tested to determine its efficacy in curing sickness before it can actually be prescribed.
• Research is undertaken for the continuous development and further productivity in any field. Any system that will be utilized in any organization must first be tried to determine its value and it must be better than the previous system used. Simply, research is the result am of advancing knowledge from the past.
• Research helps develop tools for assessing effectiveness of any practice and operation such as psychological tests, intelligence quotient tests, psychological assessments, among others.
This importance of research is observed in behavioral science and physical science, among others.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Several decades of research have identified the contributions of psychosocial influences on adolescent and young adult sexual behavior; however, few studies have examined parental and peer influence and sexual values during the transition from high school to college. The current study tested the influence of sexual values and perceived awareness and caring (PAC), or beliefs about how much parents and peers know and care about students’ behavior, on sexual behavior during this transitional period. Using data from a longitudinal study, generalized estimating equations and the generalized linear model were used to examine the associations among sexual values, parental and peer PAC, and sexual behavior, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Participants (N = 1,847; 61% female) completed web-based surveys the summer before college matriculation and at the end of the first semester in college. Results indicated that individuals with high levels of both parental and peer PAC engaged in less frequent sexual behaviors and that PAC moderated the effect of sexual values on sexual behaviors. Furthermore, both PAC variables decreased during the transition from high school to college, and high school sexual values, parental PAC, and their interaction predicted the number of sexual partners during the first semester of college. Only sexual values and high school unsafe sexual behaviors predicted unsafe sexual behavior in college. Findings suggest that complex associations exist among perceived awareness and caring, sexual values, and sexual behaviors, and that the transition from high school to college may be an ideal time for safer-sex interventions.</p><br />
