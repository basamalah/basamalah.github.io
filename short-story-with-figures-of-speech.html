                                            these guidelines in writing a critique for a short Guidelines in writing a critique. Follow this guide in writing your critique. A. Short Story CONTEXT: What genre is it? Adventure? Science fiction? Fantasy? Literary? AUTHOR'S INTENTION: What is the author trying to accomplish with the story? If the story is meant to be funny and isn't, or is meant to be a morality tale but doesn't quite pull it off, then it has failed in at least one respect. YOUR REACTIONS. Note your reactions as you read. Do you find something interesting about the characters and the plot? LITERARY DEVICES/TECHNIQUES: Identify if there are figures of speech used in the story, and infer their purpose. Ask yourself if the literary techniques make the reading experience more enjoyable or strengthen the story. ENDING OF THE STORY: Decide how the ending relates both to the story as a whole and to its beginning. Does the ending resolve the plot and bring closure to the crisis of the characters?

                                            Task: A Critical Mind at Work Choose a short story or a persuasive essay and write a critique about it. Follow the following guide in writing your critique. A. Short Story CONTEXT: What genre is it? Adventure? Science fiction? Fantasy? Literary? AUTHOR'S INTENTION: What is the author trying to accomplish with the story? If the story is meant to be funny and isn't, or is meant to be a morality tale but doesn't quite pull it off, then it has failed in at least one respect. YOUR REACTIONS: Note your reactions as you read. Do you find something interesting about the characters and the plot? LITERARY DEVICES/TECHNIQUES: Identify if there are figures of speech used in the story, and infer their purpose. Ask yourself if the literary techniques make the reading experience more enjoyable or strengthen the story. ENDING OF THE STORY: Decide how the ending relates both to the story as a whole and to its beginning. Does the ending resolve the plot and bring closure to the crisis of the characters?​</a>
