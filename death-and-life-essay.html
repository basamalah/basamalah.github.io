                                            Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.  The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.​</a>

                                            Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants?                            Excerpt from an essay written by Kris GledhillAfter England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day" Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people.Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method"Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee.So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing.In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included.We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene?Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures" The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal.1. What is the editorial's main point?2. Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.3.

                                            Read the selection below. Then answer the questions provided. Write the letter of the correct answer.Life has its disappointments and many of them are far from trivial. The birth of a defective child, the loss of a job the disintegration of a romance, the death of a loved one - such are some of the major traumas all must go through at one time or another. And even those who seem capable of coping with minor letdowns sometimes fall apart when some major disappointments come along.	There are different ways of reacting to life’s vicissitudes. Some try to cope by fleeing reality. They may occupy their minds with various forms of entertainment, devotion to some cause or pursuit of some goal. They may seek relief through drugs, alcohol, or even suicide. Others may handle them by rewarding themselves to make up for what they have had to endure.	Such reactions may soften life’s blows by diverting one’s attention. But, life has to go on so think of a better way. One that comes to terms with reality. It has to do with understanding the purpose of life and maintaining one’s stability.	Life is not a dead-end road. It leads to somewhere. The disappointments, the trials, the problems as we all encounter are not meant to be roadblocks. They are hurdles. Their purpose is to strengthen us, not to defeat us. The realization of this monumental truth can change a person’s perspective and enable him or her to deal with adversity.Source: It’s a Question of Perspective (Excerpt). Clayton Steep6.

With that, contemplating of man's short stay, Saw man like to those flowers pass away. Yet built he houses, thick and strong and high, As if he'd live to all Eternity. Hoards up a mass of wealth, yet cannot fill His empty mind, but covet will he still. To gain or keep, such falsehood will he use! Wrong, right, or truth-no base ways will refuse. I would not blame him could he death out keep, Or ease his pains or be secure of sleep: Or buy Heaven's mansions-like the gods become, And with his gold rule stars and moon and sun: Command the winds to blow, seas to obey, Level their waves and make their breezes stay. But he no power hath unless to die, And care in life is only misery. This care is but a word, an empty sound, a Wherein there is no soul nor substance found; Yet as his heir he makes it to inherit, And all he has he leaves unto this spirit. To get this Child of Fame and this bare word, He fears no dangers, neither fire nor sword: All horrid pains and death he will endure, Or any thing can he but fame procure O man, O man, what high ambition grows Within his brain, and yet how low he goes! To be contented only with a sound, Wherein is neither peace nor life nor body foundpasagot po thankyouu​</a>

                                            Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind. The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes. a​</a>

                                            Read the selection below. Then answer the questions provided. Write the letter of the correct answer.Life has its disappointments and many of them are far from trivial. The birth of a defective child, the loss of a job the disintegration of a romance, the death of a loved one - such are some of the major traumas all must go through at one time or another. And even those who seem capable of coping with minor letdowns sometimes fall apart when some major disappointments come along.	There are different ways of reacting to life’s vicissitudes. Some try to cope by fleeing reality. They may occupy their minds with various forms of entertainment, devotion to some cause or pursuit of some goal. They may seek relief through drugs, alcohol, or even suicide. Others may handle them by rewarding themselves to make up for what they have had to endure.	Such reactions may soften life’s blows by diverting one’s attention. But, life has to go on so think of a better way. One that comes to terms with reality. It has to do with understanding the purpose of life and maintaining one’s stability.	Life is not a dead-end road. It leads to somewhere. The disappointments, the trials, the problems as we all encounter are not meant to be roadblocks. They are hurdles. Their purpose is to strengthen us, not to defeat us. The realization of this monumental truth can change a person’s perspective and enable him or her to deal with adversity.Source: It’s a Question of Perspective (Excerpt). Clayton Steep6.

They are the heroes of the Philippines
Many years ago
He did it indefinitely
Such a good show
Lapu-lapu is the first hero
He defeated opponents fiercely
Wants to occupy and oppress
They failed and were defeated
Jose Rizal is the national hero
His brains used to be good
Help the people from being oppressed
In his hometown he was made a servant
Andres Bonifacio father of
KatipunanFought for freedom
Not afraid of foreigners
Not betrayed until death
Apolinario Mabini the great cripple
Handicapped but smart
In the rebellion he was a counselor
Even sick do not beat
Freedom is what we want to achieve
Until the world shrinks
And life became the substitute
In the hands of the cruel foreigner.</a>

                                            Original text:
“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</a>

                                            C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

                        <p></p><p>Life and death are two sides of the same coin. However, we spend most of our time dealing with life and rejecting or denying somehow the natural aspect of death, perhaps because we might see it as a final end. Death is commonly related to pain, suffering, loss and uncertainty. Ancient civilizations like that of Tibet had a different approach and were able to accept death naturally, almost inspired by the analogy of changing clothes when those we are wearing become old or worn out. But because death carries a mysterious element and is an unpredictable event, it is difficult but perhaps not impossible to understand.</p><p>piniritong talong</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sensya na godbless HAHHHAAAH</p><br />

                            4. Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind.  The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes.​</h2><br />

                            7. Read the selection below. Then answer the questions provided. Write the letter of the correct answer.Life has its disappointments and many of them are far from trivial. The birth of a defective child, the loss of a job the disintegration of a romance, the death of a loved one - such are some of the major traumas all must go through at one time or another. And even those who seem capable of coping with minor letdowns sometimes fall apart when some major disappointments come along.	There are different ways of reacting to life’s vicissitudes. Some try to cope by fleeing reality. They may occupy their minds with various forms of entertainment, devotion to some cause or pursuit of some goal. They may seek relief through drugs, alcohol, or even suicide. Others may handle them by rewarding themselves to make up for what they have had to endure.	Such reactions may soften life’s blows by diverting one’s attention. But, life has to go on so think of a better way. One that comes to terms with reality. It has to do with understanding the purpose of life and maintaining one’s stability.	Life is not a dead-end road. It leads to somewhere. The disappointments, the trials, the problems as we all encounter are not meant to be roadblocks. They are hurdles. Their purpose is to strengthen us, not to defeat us. The realization of this monumental truth can change a person’s perspective and enable him or her to deal with adversity.Source: It’s a Question of Perspective (Excerpt). Clayton Steep6.

I would not blame him could he death out keep, Or ease his pains or be secure of sleep: Or buy Heaven's mansions-like the gods become, And with his gold rule stars and moon and sun: Command the winds to blow, seas to obey, Level their waves and make their breezes stay. But he no power hath unless to die, And care in life is only misery. This care is but a word, an empty sound, a Wherein there is no soul nor substance found; Yet as his heir he makes it to inherit, And all he has he leaves unto this spirit. To get this Child of Fame and this bare word, He fears no dangers, neither fire nor sword: All horrid pains and death he will endure, Or any thing can he but fame procure O man, O man, what high ambition grows Within his brain, and yet how low he goes!

                            14. Instruction: Read the essay "Why Life is Important" and then write the summary. Why is Life Important? One important aspect of Life is that it keeps going forward. This means nothing is permanent. Hence, there should be a reason to stay in dejection. A happy occasion will come to pass, just like a sad one. Above all, one must be optimistic no matter how bad things get. This is because nothing will stay forever. Every situation, occasion, and event shall pass. This is certainly a beauty of Life. Many people become very sad because of failures. However, these people certainly fail to see the bright side. The bright side is that there is a reason for every failure. Therefore, every failure teaches us a valuable lesson. This means every failure builds experience. This experience is what improves the skills and efficiency of humans. Probably a huge number of individuals complain that Life is a pain. Many people believe that the word pain is a synonym for Life. However, it is pain that makes us stronger. Pain is certainly an excellent way of increasing mental resilience. Above all, pain enriches the mind. The uncertainty of death is what makes life so precious. No one knows the hour of one's death. This probably is the most important reason to live life to the fullest. Staying in depression or being a workaholic is an utter wastage of Life. One must certainly enjoy the beautiful blessings of Life before death overtakes. a​</h2><br />

                            19. Read the selection below. Then answer the questions provided. Write the letter of the correct answer.Life has its disappointments and many of them are far from trivial. The birth of a defective child, the loss of a job the disintegration of a romance, the death of a loved one - such are some of the major traumas all must go through at one time or another. And even those who seem capable of coping with minor letdowns sometimes fall apart when some major disappointments come along.	There are different ways of reacting to life’s vicissitudes. Some try to cope by fleeing reality. They may occupy their minds with various forms of entertainment, devotion to some cause or pursuit of some goal. They may seek relief through drugs, alcohol, or even suicide. Others may handle them by rewarding themselves to make up for what they have had to endure.	Such reactions may soften life’s blows by diverting one’s attention. But, life has to go on so think of a better way. One that comes to terms with reality. It has to do with understanding the purpose of life and maintaining one’s stability.	Life is not a dead-end road. It leads to somewhere. The disappointments, the trials, the problems as we all encounter are not meant to be roadblocks. They are hurdles. Their purpose is to strengthen us, not to defeat us. The realization of this monumental truth can change a person’s perspective and enable him or her to deal with adversity.Source: It’s a Question of Perspective (Excerpt). Clayton Steep6.

Lapu-lapu is the first hero
He defeated opponents fiercely
Wants to occupy and oppress
They failed and were defeated
Jose Rizal is the national hero
His brains used to be good
Help the people from being oppressed
In his hometown he was made a servant
Andres Bonifacio father of
KatipunanFought for freedom
Not afraid of foreigners
Not betrayed until death
Apolinario Mabini the great cripple
Handicapped but smart
In the rebellion he was a counselor
Even sick do not beat
Freedom is what we want to achieve
Until the world shrinks
And life became the substitute
In the hands of the cruel foreigner.</h2><br />

                            23. Original text:
“Are Men More Creative Than Women?”
Throughout history it has been men, for the most part, who have engaged in public life. Men have sought for public achievement and recognition, while women obtained their main satisfactions by bearing and rearing children. In women’s eyes, public achievement makes a man more attractive as a marriage partner. But for men the situation is reversed. The more a woman achieves publicly, the less desirable she seems as a wife. There are three possible positions one can tackle about male and female creativity. The first is that males are inherently more creative in all fields. The second is that if it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males. If this were the case, then if men were permitted the enjoyment women have always had in rearing young children, male creativity might be reduced also. (There is some indication in the United States today that this is so.) The third possible position is that certain forms of creativity are more congenial to one sex than to the other and that the great creative acts will therefore come from only one sex in a given field. (Mozaic, 1985) “If it were not for the greater appeal of crating and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males”
Paraphrased text:
Men and women throughout the years has one noticeable is their creativity. There have been arguments and debates to what limits a woman's creativity since men have been dominant in this category or so they say. They say that women are limited due to time being taken by the children they are raising, if that would not be the case for men they said that men creativity would fluctuate. It is stated from a quote (Mozaic, 1985) "If it were not for the greater appeal of crafting and cherishing young human beings, females would be as creative as males". Although the creativity of a man or woman's affects their social status, it can be said that throughout our era this has been changing making women prove they are more than what they were.

“Essays”
There are two kinds of essay, the formal essay and the informal essay, often called the personal essay. A formal essay is is more carefully organized and more serious than a personal essay. Formal essays were developed by Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman of the mid 1950’s and early 1600s. His essays are short, impersonal, and informative, and they discuss such subjects as death, fear, truth, and wealth. A personal essay is written in casual, conversational style. The chief characteristics of the personal essay is its informality. Its purpose is first to interest and only incidentally to inform. Consequently, it is a more artistic and a less utilitarian form of a composition than the formal essay.</h2><br />

In comparison to a personal essay, a formal essay is more meticulously planned and serious. Sir Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and statesman who lived between the mid-1950s and the early 1600s, is credited with creating the formal essay. His works cover topics like death, fear, truth, and riches and are condensed, impartial, and informed. The writing style of a personal essay is informal and conversational. The informality of the personal essay is one of its main qualities. Its primary goal is to pique interest, with informational value coming second. As a result, compared to the formal essay, it is a more aesthetic and less practical type of production.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Its origin has always been debated and discussed today by various scholars. In sociological terms, ‘Religion is a system of sacred belief and practices both in the tangible and intangible form’. Religion can serve the dual role of ideology as well as institution. Today, religion has assumed a more narrow-minded approach. However, understanding religion in the broad sense highlights the following important points about it in society:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Cultural Identity</p><p>Religion plays a crucial role for a person in giving a cultural identity. Each religion has festivals, traditions, mythologies which form a part of the tangible and intangible heritage of the country. Thus, religion contributes in order to protect this heritage and also adds to the diversity in the country.</p><p></p><p>Values and Ethics</p><p>Religion helps in creating an ethical framework and also a regulator for values in day to day life. This particular approach helps in character building of a person. In other words, Religion acts as an agency of socialization. Thus, religion helps in building values like love, empathy, respect, and harmony.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Spiritual Connect</p><p>People are always on the quest of fulfilling the economic and material pursuits in today’s world. It is the religion which plays a crucial role in establishing our connection to the divine and developing the belief that there is a supreme energy that acts as a regulator in our day to day lives. Thus, the components of prayer, chants, hymns, etc. creates the spiritual bond.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Idea of Welfare</p><p>Each and every religion promotes its philosophy and the crux of it has always been the welfare and wellness of the people. For example, in the Sanatana Dharma, there are ideas like Vasudaiva Kutumbakam (the whole world is a family), Sarve Sukhina Bhavantu (let everyone be happy) which nurture and cultivate love and compassion in the society.</p><br />

                            28. C. Open-Ended Questions. Read the essay thoroughly. Then, answer the questions that follow. Could Britain be sued for reopening and exposing the world to new coronavirus variants? Excerpt from an essay written by Kris Gledhill After England lifted the majority of Covid-19 restrictions, the world is anticipating "Freedom Day." Some skepticism is warranted given the UK's failure to respond to the pandemic. Covid-19 had resulted in a death rate per million population of just under 1,900 by July 19. True, Hungary, Italy, and the Czech Republic have higher rates. Australia outnumbers New Zealand by 35.8 deaths per million people. Boris Johnson's government was elected with a landslide victory and a successful vaccination campaign. The current situation, however, is bleak. As a result, Europe's mortality rate is rising. Despite lower rates of death and infection, states in Australia have imposed lockdowns. Furthermore, it is opposed by many scientists. The risks to the 17 million unvaccinated Britons are as follows: "There is a worldwide threat to everyone's safety as a result of this method." Do you think Boris de Pfeffer Johnson will take these concerns seriously? Is it possible to sue the United Kingdom specifically in front of the United Nations human rights courts? Or even at the Council of Europe's European Court of Human Rights. A global option is the UN Human Rights Committee. So, what is it exactly? That "cause of action" violates human rights, including the right to life and the prohibition on torture. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the leading international human rights treaty, mandates the protection of everyone's right to life in Article 6. Article 2 of the ECHR says the same thing. In 2019, states must also combat deadly diseases, according to the UN Human Rights Committee. If a state is aware (or should be aware) that human life is in danger, it must take reasonable precautions. However, given that the entire human rights framework was designed to prevent state violations, there is no reason why government policies based on the assumption of death should not be included. We must guard beyond death. THE ICCPR AND THE EC FORBID INHUMAN AND DEFAMATORY TREATMENT. Many people believe that Covid-19's severity, including the long Covid's consequences, is adequate. Human rights standards require that the consequences be mitigated. It is not only about health. The rest of the world is worried that the UK will allow the virus to spread. Can other countries intervene? Human rights conventions are agreements between states on how to act in certain situations. According to Article 33 of the ECHR, states can request that the ECHR ruling on rights violations. It occurs regularly. To maintain the status quo, the court has the authority to issue "interim measures." The United Kingdom has agreed to sue another state under Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Of course, suing another state is political. This pandemic, on the other hand, is about more than just health. The protection of human life is a political priority. Human rights advocates should make use of the tools at their disposal. 1.

</p>1.	What is the editorial’s main point?  <p>The central point of the editorial is to question whether United Kingdom should be accounted for causing the rising of cases and deaths due to COVID19.

</p>2.	Is there evidence to back up the main point? Give three examples.  Among these evidences are;
<p>a.	UK’s premature lifting of COVID19 protocols
