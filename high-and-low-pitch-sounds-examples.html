                                            Intensity of sound. 21. The speed of sound changes as it passes through different media. 22. Sound wave travels fastest in solids and slowest in gas. 23. The highness or lowness of sound is called pitch. 24. The higher the frequency of sound waves, the higher the pitch. 25. Red light has longer wavelength but lower in frequency, while violet light has shorter wavelength but higher in frequency. 26. Red and green combination of colors for visible light is correct. 27. If an object releases heat, the temperature of the object is lower. 28. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from one object to another, while temperature refers to the degree of coldness or hotness of an object. 29. When a a metal spoon put in a glass of boiling water, the heat energy flows from the boiling water to the metal spoon. 30. Convection happens when there is a difference in temperature both in liquid &amp; gas. 31. Sun bathing on the beach is an example of radiation. 32. Boiling water, air-conditioner and hot air balloon are examples of convection.True or False?​</a>

The highness or lowness of sound is called pitch. 24. The higher the frequency of sound waves, the higher the pitch. 25. Red light has longer wavelength but lower in frequency, while violet light has shorter wavelength but higher in frequency. 26. Red and green combination of colors for visible light is correct. 27. If an object releases heat, the temperature of the object is lower. 28. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from one object to another, while temperature refers to the degree of coldness or hotness of an object. 29. When a a metal spoon put in a glass of boiling water, the heat energy flows from the boiling water to the metal spoon. 30.

                        ANSWER:<p></p><p>Sound is about <strong>(1)</strong> <strong>vibrations</strong> it is an example of a <strong>(2)</strong> <strong>longitudinal</strong>  wave. sound being known also as a mechanical wave needs matter in order to travel. This matter is better known as <strong>(3)</strong> <strong>medium.</strong><strong>  </strong>Sound can travel in <strong>(4)</strong><strong>Solid</strong> , <strong>(5) </strong><strong>Liquid</strong> and <strong>(6)</strong> <strong>gas</strong> but it cannot travel in a <strong>(7)</strong> <strong>vacuum</strong> .Sound move<strong> (8) </strong><strong>Fastest</strong>  in solid and <strong>(9)</strong> <strong>slowest </strong> in gas. there are three distinct characteristics of sound namely <strong>(10)</strong> <strong>Pitch </strong> <strong>(11) </strong><strong>Loudness/Intensity</strong> and</p><p><strong>(12)</strong><strong> Quality/timbre. </strong> Loudness or intensinty is the loudness of softness of sound it depends on the <strong>(13) </strong><strong>Amplitude</strong> of sound waves the higher the amplitude the louder the sound is. Pitch is the highness or lowness of sound it depends on the <strong>(14)</strong><strong> frequency</strong> of sound waves. The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch. Frequency has something to do with the <strong>(15) </strong><strong>wavelength</strong>  of the sound wave, for high frequency is when wavelength is short and therefore waves are closest to each other.</p><p></p><strong>#CARRYONLEARNING</strong><p><strong>brainliest pls ^^</strong></p><br />

                            28. -practice HONESTY.True or FalseM Directions: Write T if the statement is correct, and F if otherwise. Write your answers in the spaceprovided.1. Surface waves are combination of transverse and longitudinal waves.2. Intensity of the sound is not related to loudness of the sound.3. Soft sounds have greater amplitude than loud sound.4. A periodic wave can be regarded as a series of pulse.5. The quality of the sound is also known as timbre.6. A longitudinal wave occurs when there is an upward and downward motion of an objectmoving away from the source.7. The higher the frequency of the sound, the higher the pitch.8. Waves are classified as transverse and longitudinal.9. The frequency of the sound waves determines the pitch of the sound.10. Waves with low frequency produce sounds with high pitch.11. Ultrasound waves and sound waves are best examples of transverse wave.12. Waves can carry the energy.​</h2><br />
