Bayan Ko 
Jose Corazon de Jesus
Ang bayan kong Pilipinas
Lupain ng ginto't bulaklak
Pag-ibig ang sa kanyang palad
Nag-alay ng ganda't dilag.
At sa kanyang yumi at ganda
Dayuhan ay nahalina
Bayan ko, binihag ka
Nasadlak sa dusa.
Ibon mang may layang lumipad
Kulungin mo at umiiyak
Bayan pa kayang sakdal dilag
Ang di magnasang makaalpas!
Pilipinas kong minumutya
Pugad ng luha ko't dalita
Aking adhika,
Makita kang sakdal laya!</a>

He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.

                                            The Origin of the Stars Tagalog Legend Hundreds of years ago, some people say there were no stars. The sun was a mighty god, ruler of the day. Buan, the moon, was a rival god of the sun and desired to rule both day and night. Lihangin, god of the wind, was a friend of both the sun and the moon. One day he went to visit Araw, god of the sun, to warm himself. When they were sitting together, Araw told Lihangin that he had bad feelings toward Buan. He said that he noticed him showing during the day. This meant that Baun desired to occupy a part of Araw's kingdom. Lihangin wanted them to be good friends. He told Buan not to occupy any part of Araw's kingdom. He said that Araw was fair and just, so Buan must be, too. The moon did not pay attention to his advice. He continued to shine during the latter part of the day and sometimes during the morning. Araw could not bear it. He told Buan not to do it anymore. Buan insisted. They had a quarrel. Buan was badly hit. Parts of his body were scattered around, and these became the stars, leaving the moon without its former light. Such was the origin of the stars. drawing http://seasite2.niu.edu/philippine-folk-tales/tagalog-myths-the-origin-of-the-stars/​</a>

Having the desire from a sublime mind rather than by an ill intention will lead a higher possibility of victory. Thus, whatever it is that you desire with your sublime and pure mind for the cooperate management to be, it will certainly prevail and succeed. There are self-centered people who only care about themselves. Even those greedy and egoistic individuals can achieve their goal. An ardent desire becomes reality whether the intensions are upright or selfish. However, if the desire arises from greed and self-interest, the same desire which brought success initially will cause to fall through in the end.​</a>

Lupain ng ginto't bulaklak
Pag-ibig ang sa kanyang palad
Nag-alay ng ganda't dilag.
At sa kanyang yumi at ganda
Dayuhan ay nahalina
Bayan ko, binihag ka
Nasadlak sa dusa.
Ibon mang may layang lumipad
Kulungin mo at umiiyak
Bayan pa kayang sakdal dilag
Ang di magnasang makaalpas!
Pilipinas kong minumutya

                            15. Why The Sky is High (Tagalog myth)In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their parents on Earth.As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was, therefore, his father's right hand man.  He was always helping with the work in the field, and his parents were very pleased with him.On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily.  In the absence of a daughter in the family, the house work came to be Daskol's responsibility.  He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the cooking.  He also pounded the palay that his father and Ingat harvested.  Even in pounding, Daskol lived up to his name.  Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground.  Being naturally lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual.   He was irritated because every time he raised the pestle, it would hit the sky.   His anger added to his strength and desire to finish the work quickly.  So he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised.  In his hurry, Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising.  When he finished pounding rice, he looked up and discovered that the sky had risen, and that is why it is where it is today.1.	Who are the brothers?2.	Who was careful in everything he did?3.

                            17. The Origin of the Stars Tagalog Legend Hundreds of years ago, some people say there were no stars. The sun was a mighty god, ruler of the day. Buan, the moon, was a rival god of the sun and desired to rule both day and night. Lihangin, god of the wind, was a friend of both the sun and the moon. One day he went to visit Araw, god of the sun, to warm himself. When they were sitting together, Araw told Lihangin that he had bad feelings toward Buan. He said that he noticed him showing during the day. This meant that Baun desired to occupy a part of Araw's kingdom. Lihangin wanted them to be good friends. He told Buan not to occupy any part of Araw's kingdom. He said that Araw was fair and just, so Buan must be, too. The moon did not pay attention to his advice. He continued to shine during the latter part of the day and sometimes during the morning. Araw could not bear it. He told Buan not to do it anymore. Buan insisted. They had a quarrel. Buan was badly hit. Parts of his body were scattered around, and these became the stars, leaving the moon without its former light. Such was the origin of the stars. drawing http://seasite2.niu.edu/philippine-folk-tales/tagalog-myths-the-origin-of-the-stars/​</h2><br />
