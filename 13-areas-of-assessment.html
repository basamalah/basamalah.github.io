Find the area of each combined figure.
1..A square and a semi-circle. The square has a side length of 13 feet. The diameter of the circle matches the square's side.
2..A square and a semi-circle. The square has a side length of 15.5 feet. The diameter of the circle matches
the square's side
3.A rectangle and a semi-circle. The rectangle has a length of 8 feet and a width of 5 feet. The diameter of
the circle matches the width.
4.A rectangle and a semi-circle. The rectangle has a length of 8.5 feet and a width of 6 feet. The diameter of
the circle matches the width.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Square and Semi-circle:</p><p>Since the diameter of the circle matches the side length of the square, the radius of the semi-circle is equal to half the side length of the square. Therefore, the radius of the semi-circle is:</p><p>r = 13 feet / 2 = 6.5 feet</p><p></p><p>The area of the square is:</p><p></p><p>A_square = (side length)^2 = (13 feet)^2 = 169 square feet</p><p></p><p>The area of the semi-circle is:</p><p></p><p>A_semi-circle = (1/2) x π x r^2 = (1/2) x π x (6.5 feet)^2</p><p>A_semi-circle = 66.62 square feet (rounded to two decimal places)</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total area of the figure (square and semi-circle) is:</p><p></p><p>Total area = A_square + A_semi-circle</p><p>Total area = 169 square feet + 66.62 square feet</p><p>Total area = 235.62 square feet (rounded to two decimal places)</p><p></p><p>2. Square and Semi-circle:</p><p>Using the same method as above, we can find the area of the square and semi-circle. The radius of the semi-circle is:</p><p>r = 15.5 feet / 2 = 7.75 feet</p><p></p><p>The area of the square is:</p><p></p><p>A_square = (side length)^2 = (15.5 feet)^2 = 240.25 square feet</p><p></p><p>The area of the semi-circle is:</p><p></p><p>A_semi-circle = (1/2) x π x r^2 = (1/2) x π x (7.75 feet)^2</p><p>A_semi-circle = 59.57 square feet (rounded to two decimal places)</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total area of the figure (square and semi-circle) is:</p><p></p><p>Total area = A_square + A_semi-circle</p><p>Total area = 240.25 square feet + 59.57 square feet</p><p>Total area = 299.82 square feet (rounded to two decimal places)</p><p></p><p>3. Rectangle and Semi-circle:</p><p>Since the diameter of the circle matches the width of the rectangle, the radius of the semi-circle is equal to half the width of the rectangle. Therefore, the radius of the semi-circle is:</p><p>r = 5 feet / 2 = 2.5 feet</p><p></p><p>The area of the rectangle is:</p><p></p><p>A_rectangle = length x width = 8 feet x 5 feet = 40 square feet</p><p></p><p>The area of the semi-circle is:</p><p></p><p>A_semi-circle = (1/2) x π x r^2 = (1/2) x π x (2.5 feet)^2</p><p>A_semi-circle = 4.91 square feet (rounded to two decimal places)</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total area of the figure (rectangle and semi-circle) is:</p><p></p><p>Total area = A_rectangle + A_semi-circle</p><p>Total area = 40 square feet + 4.91 square feet</p><p>Total area = 44.91 square feet (rounded to two decimal places)</p><p></p><p>4. Rectangle and Semi-circle:</p><p>Using the same method as above, we can find the area of the rectangle and semi-circle. The radius of the semi-circle is:</p><p>r = 6 feet / 2 = 3 feet</p><p></p><p>The area of the rectangle is:</p><p></p><p>A_rectangle = length x width = 8.5 feet x 6 feet = 51 square feet</p><p></p><p>The area of the semi-circle is:</p><p></p><p>A_semi-circle = (1/2) x π x r^2 = (1/2) x π x (3 feet)^2</p><p>A_semi-circle = 4.71 square feet (rounded to two decimal places)</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the total area of the figure (rectangle and semi-circle) is:</p><p></p><p>Total area = A_rectangle</p><p></p><p></p><br />
