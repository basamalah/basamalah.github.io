                                            DIRECTIONS: WRITE TRUE IF THE STATEMENT IS CORRECT. OTHERWISE, WRITE FALSE. 1. If an ethnographer can gain full access, then their research might be more thorough. 2. The setting of your ethnographic research refers to the environment in which you observe and conduct your research. 3. Gaining access into a prison to study the social and cultural norms of inmates would be more difficult is an example of a closed setting. 4. A covert study is potentially more ethical because it allows the group to make an informed decision on whether they consent to the researcher or not. 5. Overt ethnography refers to an ethnographer who does not disclose that they're studying the group, so the researcher may provide a different explanation for being there.​</a>

                                            Directions: Analyze the examples of research and determine what kind of research design was used in the study. Identify the dependent, independent, and controlled variable. Create a framework on how you would plan your set up. Indicate the controlled set up and experimental set up if present.
6. A researcher wishes to conduct a study on the effect of using hanging method, staking method, and broadcasting method in culturing Mytilus edilus (Mussel) in brackish water of Dipolog Bay. These three methods were the independent variable. Mean and ANOVA will be used to test the significant difference in the weight of the mussels using the three methods.
7. A researcher wishes to determine the relationship between the weight and length of Scylla serrate (Mud crab) cultured in the fishpond using bread meal as supplemental feed.
8. An investigator wants to conduct a study on the effect of culturing Penaeus monodon (Prawn) in fishpond using fish meal, bread meal, shrimp meal and fish silage as supplemental feeds. Each supplemental feed is replicated thrice. Hence, there are 12 compartments in all in culturing prawn. Mean and ANOVA were used to determine if a signifant diffence exists.
9. A study on the yield of culturing Clarias batrachus (Catfish) using shrimp meal as supplemental feed in the fishpond was conducted. The researcher uses 3,000 catfish fingerlings and three compartments in the pond. The 3,000 pieces of fingerlings are placed at random in the pond. The 1,000 pieces of fingerlings are placed in each compartment at random. The weight of each fingerlings in each compartment is observed carefully and the ecological parameters such as Ph, salinity, oxygen and temperature are considered. There are three different levels or percentage of shrimp meal in each compartment based on the body weight of catfish. Mean and ANOVA are the statistical tool to be used.
10. Suppose the researcher wishes to conduct a study on the effectiveness of culturing lapu-lapu in fish cages using pellets, breadmeal, shrimp meal, and fish meal as supplemental feed. Mean and ANOVA are the statistical tools to determine if there is a significant difference in the weight of lapu-lapu in fish cages using pellets, breadmeal, shrimp meal, and fish meal as supplemental feed.</a>

                            4. Directions: Analyze the examples of research and determine what kind of research design was used in the study. Identify the dependent, independent, and controlled variable. Create a framework on how you would plan your set up. Indicate the controlled set up and experimental set up if present.
6. A researcher wishes to conduct a study on the effect of using hanging method, staking method, and broadcasting method in culturing Mytilus edilus (Mussel) in brackish water of Dipolog Bay. These three methods were the independent variable. Mean and ANOVA will be used to test the significant difference in the weight of the mussels using the three methods.
7. A researcher wishes to determine the relationship between the weight and length of Scylla serrate (Mud crab) cultured in the fishpond using bread meal as supplemental feed.
8. An investigator wants to conduct a study on the effect of culturing Penaeus monodon (Prawn) in fishpond using fish meal, bread meal, shrimp meal and fish silage as supplemental feeds. Each supplemental feed is replicated thrice. Hence, there are 12 compartments in all in culturing prawn. Mean and ANOVA were used to determine if a signifant diffence exists.
9. A study on the yield of culturing Clarias batrachus (Catfish) using shrimp meal as supplemental feed in the fishpond was conducted. The researcher uses 3,000 catfish fingerlings and three compartments in the pond. The 3,000 pieces of fingerlings are placed at random in the pond. The 1,000 pieces of fingerlings are placed in each compartment at random. The weight of each fingerlings in each compartment is observed carefully and the ecological parameters such as Ph, salinity, oxygen and temperature are considered. There are three different levels or percentage of shrimp meal in each compartment based on the body weight of catfish. Mean and ANOVA are the statistical tool to be used.
10. Suppose the researcher wishes to conduct a study on the effectiveness of culturing lapu-lapu in fish cages using pellets, breadmeal, shrimp meal, and fish meal as supplemental feed. Mean and ANOVA are the statistical tools to determine if there is a significant difference in the weight of lapu-lapu in fish cages using pellets, breadmeal, shrimp meal, and fish meal as supplemental feed.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>attack on titan in history ohh</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Study design depends greatly on the nature of the research question. In other words, knowing what kind of information the study should collect is a first step in determining how the study will be carried out (also known as the methodology).
</p><p>
</p><p>Let’s say we want to investigate the relationship between daily walking and cholesterol levels in the body. One of the first things we’d have to determine is the type of study that will tell us the most about that relationship. Do we want to compare cholesterol levels among different populations of walkers and non-walkers at the same point in time? Or, do we want to measure cholesterol levels in a single population of daily walkers over an extended period of time?
</p><p>
</p><p>The first approach is typical of a cross-sectional study. The second requires a longitudinal study. To make our choice, we need to know more about the benefits and purpose of each study type.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cross-sectional study
</p><p>Both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal studies are observational studies. This means that researchers record information about their subjects without manipulating the study environment. In our study, we would simply measure the cholesterol levels of daily walkers and non-walkers along with any other characteristics that might be of interest to us. We would not influence non-walkers to take up that activity, or advise daily walkers to modify their behaviour. In short, we’d try not to interfere.
</p><p>
</p><p>The defining feature of a cross-sectional study is that it can compare different population groups at a single point in time. Think of it in terms of taking a snapshot. Findings are drawn from whatever fits into the frame.
</p><p>
</p><p>To return to our example, we might choose to measure cholesterol levels in daily walkers across two age groups, over 40 and under 40, and compare these to cholesterol levels among non-walkers in the same age groups. We might even create subgroups for gender. However, we would not consider past or future cholesterol levels, for these would fall outside the frame. We would look only at cholesterol levels at one point in time.
</p><p>
</p><p>The benefit of a cross-sectional study design is that it allows researchers to compare many different variables at the same time. We could, for example, look at age, gender, income and educational level in relation to walking and cholesterol levels, with little or no additional cost.
</p><p>
</p><p>However, cross-sectional studies may not provide definite information about cause-and-effect relationships. This is because such studies offer a snapshot of a single moment in time; they do not consider what happens before or after the snapshot is taken. Therefore, we can’t know for sure if our daily walkers had low cholesterol levels before taking up their exercise regimes, or if the behaviour of daily walking helped to reduce cholesterol levels that previously were high.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

EXAMPLES: INDEPENDENT VARIABLEEngaging in group study DEPENDENT VARIABLE Score in exam ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS Engaging in group study will result in a higher score in an examination. NULL HYPOTHESIS Engaging in group study will not result in a higher scores in an examination. Your turn!
