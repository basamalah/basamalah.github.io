As you begin to analyze the data you collected through experiments, make sure your team sets aside.</strong><strong></strong><strong>30.design an experiment </strong><strong></strong><strong>the information in this chapter is a
</strong><strong>short summary of some topics that are
</strong><strong>covered in depth in the book Students
</strong><strong>and Research written by Cothron, Giese, and
</strong><strong>Rezba. See the end of this chapter for full
</strong><strong>information on obtaining this book. The book
</strong><strong>is an invaluable resource for any middle or
</strong><strong>high school science teacher.</strong><strong></strong><strong>31. identify problem or questions </strong><strong></strong><strong>Research questions are generated from problems that require further research and understanding while fulfilling the objectives of the study.
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>For example, using the research problems above, our questions could be:
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>"How will climate change policies influence sustainability standards across specific geographies?"
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>"What measures can be taken to address wage disparity without increasing inflation?"</strong><strong></strong><strong>32. collecting the data </strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on targeted variables in an established system, which then enables one to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes.</strong><strong></strong><strong>33.observation about the problem </strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Peer-to-peer observation: Looking at how other users might be tackling this problem.
</strong><strong>Non-participant observation: Observe what happens in a process or situation.
</strong><strong>Shadowing: Follow the ‘problem holder’ around while they are dealing with the problem.
</strong><strong>First-hand experience: Take on the role of the problem holder and do what they do.</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>34. communicate the result </strong><strong></strong><strong>Communicating your results is often the first step to clearly identifying a problem and beginning to think about possible solutions.</strong><strong></strong><strong>35. development of a hypothesis</strong><strong></strong><strong>They are developed by considering existing evidence and using reasoning to infer what will happen in the specific context of interest. Hypotheses are often but not always derived from theories.
