                                            Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind. Put in your own language your understanding of the Philosophy of Churchland and Church about self:​</a>

                                            Text-to-self connections are highly perso a reader makes between a piece of reading material and the reader's own experiences or life. Example: are occur This story reminds me of a vacation we took to my grandfather's farm Text-to-text connections when readers reminded of what they have read/viewed with the other books by the same author, stories from a similar text types, or perhaps on the same topic. Readers gain insight during reading by thinking about how the information they are reading connects to other familiar text. Example: This character has the same problem that I read about in a story last year. Text-to-world connections are the larger connections that a reader brings to a reading situation. This allows the reader's ideas about how the world works that goes far beyond own experiences. We learn about things through television, movies, magazines, and newspapers. Often, it is the text-to-world connections that teachers are trying to enhance when they teach lessons in science, social studies, and literature. personal Example: I saw a program on television that talked about things described in this article. (http://www.mandygregory.com/makingconnections_mini_lessons.htm) Making connections is truly vital as a comprehension skill since it helps you relate and connect what you heard/read and viewed. Moreover, it enhances your understanding of the text/passages or videos you read or viewed. Lets take this picture as another example for you to understand the competency at hand clearly.​</a>

                            6. Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind. Put in your own language your understanding of the Philosophy of Churchland and Church about self:​</h2><br />

                            8. Text-to-self connections are highly perso a reader makes between a piece of reading material and the reader's own experiences or life. Example: are occur This story reminds me of a vacation we took to my grandfather's farm Text-to-text connections when readers reminded of what they have read/viewed with the other books by the same author, stories from a similar text types, or perhaps on the same topic. Readers gain insight during reading by thinking about how the information they are reading connects to other familiar text. Example: This character has the same problem that I read about in a story last year. Text-to-world connections are the larger connections that a reader brings to a reading situation. This allows the reader's ideas about how the world works that goes far beyond own experiences. We learn about things through television, movies, magazines, and newspapers. Often, it is the text-to-world connections that teachers are trying to enhance when they teach lessons in science, social studies, and literature. personal Example: I saw a program on television that talked about things described in this article. (http://www.mandygregory.com/makingconnections_mini_lessons.htm) Making connections is truly vital as a comprehension skill since it helps you relate and connect what you heard/read and viewed. Moreover, it enhances your understanding of the text/passages or videos you read or viewed. Lets take this picture as another example for you to understand the competency at hand clearly.​</h2><br />
