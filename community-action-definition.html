What would our life and world be without communication?___________________________________________________________________________LESSON:DEFINITION OF COMMUNICATIONA. Etymological meaning of communicationThe English term 'Communication' has been evolved from Latin language. 'Communis and communicare' are two Latin words related to the word communication. Communis is noun word, which means common, communiality or sharing. Similarly, communicare is a verb, which means 'make something common'. Some scholars relate the term communication with an English word community. Community members have something common to each other. communities are {supposed to be} formed with the tie of communication. It is the foundation of community. Hence, where there is no communication, there can't be a community (Nepali 2011).B. Other meanings of communicationCommunication is a process of sharing and conveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures (McCornack, 2014).There is a wide variety of contexts and situations in which communication can be manifested; it can be a face-to-face interaction, a phone conversation, a group discussion, a meeting or interview, a letter correspondence, a class recitation, and many others (Sepacio and Balgos 2016).Elements of CommunicationCommunication is divided into elements which help us better understand its mechanics or process. These elements are the following:1. Speaker – the source or communicator or sender of information or message. The communicator initiates the process by having a thought or an idea that she/he wishes to transmit to others. 2. Message – the information, ideas, or thoughts conveyed by the speaker in words (whether written or spoken) or in actions (gestures or symbols) 3. Encoding – the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Community action is any activity that increases the understanding, engagement and empowerment of communities in the design and delivery of local services.

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>The first key point is that community action is a process. This means that it is not something that happens overnight, but is something that takes time and effort to develop. The second key point is that community action is based on the needs of the community. This means that the community decides what action is needed, and then takes steps to make it happen. The third key point is that community action is voluntary. This means that people do not have to participate if they do not want to, and that there is no pressure to do so.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads around the world, Global Shapers are stepping up and taking action in more than 50 countries. Global Shapers, a network of young leaders under the age of 30, have already started sharing basic protective measures with their communities, translating vital resources into local languages, and launching campaigns to fight xenophobia and misinformation.
</p><p>
</p><p>Rather than resorting to fear or panic, our members are providing a more impactful response: informing themselves and helping others. To join their efforts and do your part, follow three simple actions:
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Show
</p><p>1. Stay informed and ensure others do too.
</p><p>
</p><p>As fear spreads faster than facts, inform yourself about the virus. Deepen your knowledge and point others to trusted information. This will go a long way to debunk myths and build resilience in your community.
</p><p>
</p><p>Not sure where to start? The World Economic Forum has a continuously updated platform for information on the crisis, with insights from the World Health Organization (WHO) and its global network of experts.
</p><p>
</p><p>If you or your hub want to take action, enrol in the WHO’s open online course that provides a general introduction to COVID-19 and how to protect yourself and others. Courses are free: know the facts before you act.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>2. Take action to keep your community safe.
</p><p>
</p><p>When you’re young and healthy, your risk of developing severe illness is lower. So consider those in your community who are most vulnerable, including older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes). Do your best to support them.
</p><p>
</p><p>Encourage others to take precautions, including washing your hands regularly, keeping a social distance from others and staying home when you’re sick. Basic actions like this can help limit the virus’ spread and its impact on public health, society and the economy.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Translate content into local languages and complement online activity with direct outreach and measures.</p><br />

What would our life and world be without communication?___________________________________________________________________________LESSON:DEFINITION OF COMMUNICATIONA. Etymological meaning of communicationThe English term 'Communication' has been evolved from Latin language. 'Communis and communicare' are two Latin words related to the word communication. Communis is noun word, which means common, communiality or sharing. Similarly, communicare is a verb, which means 'make something common'. Some scholars relate the term communication with an English word community. Community members have something common to each other. communities are {supposed to be} formed with the tie of communication. It is the foundation of community. Hence, where there is no communication, there can't be a community (Nepali 2011).B. Other meanings of communicationCommunication is a process of sharing and conveying messages or information from one person to another within and across channels, contexts, media, and cultures (McCornack, 2014).There is a wide variety of contexts and situations in which communication can be manifested; it can be a face-to-face interaction, a phone conversation, a group discussion, a meeting or interview, a letter correspondence, a class recitation, and many others (Sepacio and Balgos 2016).Elements of CommunicationCommunication is divided into elements which help us better understand its mechanics or process. These elements are the following:1. Speaker – the source or communicator or sender of information or message. The communicator initiates the process by having a thought or an idea that she/he wishes to transmit to others. 2. Message – the information, ideas, or thoughts conveyed by the speaker in words (whether written or spoken) or in actions (gestures or symbols) 3. Encoding – the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms ​</h2><br />

The transmission of the message from sender to recipient can be affected by a huge range of things.
