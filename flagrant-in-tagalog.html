Curbing Bad Behavior: App Seeks to Harness Overbilling by
Contractors (An Excerpt)
By NewsUSA
Those contractors routinely overbill governments at the expense of taxpayers may come as no surprise. That these over billings likely total hundreds of billions of dollars should shock and infuriate us all.  
Consider the recent example involving the city of New York
and its contractor called SAIC. In 2000, New York City contracted
SAIC for a project called City Time, an employee time management
system budgeted at $73 million. After flagrant overbilling and
kickbacks, the total project cost had ballooned to over $600 million. In 2005, an SAIC whistleblower alerted authorities about this massive overbilling. This led to a criminal fraud charge, and, in March of this year, SAIC (now called Leidos) admitted wrongdoing and agreed to a settlement of over half a million dollars.

Curbing Bad Behavior: App Seeks to Harness Overbilling by
Contractors (An Excerpt)
By NewsUSA
Those contractors routinely overbill governments at the expense of taxpayers may come as no surprise. That these over billings likely total hundreds of billions of dollars should shock and infuriate us all.  
Consider the recent example involving the city of New York
and its contractor called SAIC. In 2000, New York City contracted
SAIC for a project called City Time, an employee time management
system budgeted at $73 million. After flagrant overbilling and
kickbacks, the total project cost had ballooned to over $600 million. In 2005, an SAIC whistleblower alerted authorities about this massive overbilling. This led to a criminal fraud charge, and, in March of this year, SAIC (now called Leidos) admitted wrongdoing and agreed to a settlement of over half a million dollars.
