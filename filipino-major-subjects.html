At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.

Aside from health risks, these front liners are also a mistreatment subject from violators. Thus, this study is conducted during the pandemic and gathered data through a phone interview. It is conducted to explore the lived experiences of Barangay Tanods and how they adjusted to the drastic change in the work environment, health risk exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. It also determines the specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they cope. Lastly, it aims to map out how these experiences and impacts will improve preparations and the development of policing strategies in future crises. Moreover, three major conclusions emerge from this study's findings:(1) Barangay tanods faced difficulties in the sudden shift of their work environment (2) Most of the barangay tanods received incentives from the government to supply their health and sanitary needs (3) Barangay tanods reflected on their experiences to further improve as public servants and to be prepared for future crisis.​</a>

                                            introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</a>

At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.

                                            Jane, who is now 19 years old, has lived with her grandparents since she was a month old. Her parents worked in Japan as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). They do, however, keep in touch practically every day via social media. Her grandparents and parents describe her as a person who is picky about the friends with whom she forms tight bonds. Her grandparents saw that she chooses friends who share her characteristics and demonstrate the principles she espouses. She understands, however, that she cannot choose her family or the individuals with whom she will have to work in school and at her future workplace. Her pal describes her as a straightforward but discreet girl who is caring, fun to be around, insightful, and even filled with life's wisdom despite her young age. Her friends also noted that she respects her friends' individuality and treats them as equals, but always with the utmost respect. She does not take things subjectively, but rather objectively and based on facts, and she also researches. She is not judgmental and can connect with people from all walks of life. Her grandparents also noticed that the majority of her friends are 20 years older than she is. How would you characterize Jane's philosophical self? Back up your claim.​</a>

At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.

Aside from health risks, these front liners are also a mistreatment subject from violators. Thus, this study is conducted during the pandemic and gathered data through a phone interview. It is conducted to explore the lived experiences of Barangay Tanods and how they adjusted to the drastic change in the work environment, health risk exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. It also determines the specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they cope. Lastly, it aims to map out how these experiences and impacts will improve preparations and the development of policing strategies in future crises. Moreover, three major conclusions emerge from this study's findings:(1) Barangay tanods faced difficulties in the sudden shift of their work environment (2) Most of the barangay tanods received incentives from the government to supply their health and sanitary needs (3) Barangay tanods reflected on their experiences to further improve as public servants and to be prepared for future crisis.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In the study "Lived experiences of Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses working in COVID-19 intensive care units" published in the Belitung Nursing Journal, the researchers used a qualitative approach to explore the experiences of OFW nurses caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients in Dubai. Specifically, they used a Husserlian phenomenological approach, which seeks to describe and explore the essence of a phenomenon or experience as it is lived by the participants themselves. Through interviews with eight ICU nurses, the researchers aimed to generate a rich description of the challenges, patient care, adapting to change, and resilience experienced by OFW nurses during the pandemic. The qualitative approach allowed the researchers to gather in-depth data and generate themes and meanings from the nurses' own perspectives.</p><p></p><br />

                            14. introduction During the years of American colonialism and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Manuel Luis Quezon was arguably the most eminent and well-known pre-war Filipino leader. He was unmatched in his involvement in Philippine affairs during the years from 1907 until his death in 1944. Over the course of a career spanning the duration of American colonial authority in the Philippines, Manuel Luis Quezon possessed unrivaled knowledge of territorial politics, which culminated in his service as the Commonwealth's first president. Quezon originally fought against the United States during its invasion of the islands in the early 1900s, but with to the sheer force of his personality and natural political skill, he rapidly propelled himself into a Resident Commissioner post. He was young and brilliant politician, possessed "an ability and persistence rare and creditable to any representative in any parliament in the world," according to a political rival. In private meetings with the President and influential committee chairs, he assessed the problems and crafted legislative solutions that ultimately led to the "Jones Act of 1916," which is possibly his most cunning political triumph. Quezon was cautious of instant independence, but he worked extremely hard in the US House of Representatives to guarantee greater autonomy for his country. He once said, “Considering the time I have been here, the character of the subject, and the influences I had to fight, I feel inclined to say that I am almost surprised that I have secured so much”. Ever since he retired as a Resident Commissioner, he continued to mold the office by selecting and sometimes dismissing his appointees. Quezon was regarded as "bright but lazy," but he showed off his courageous, brash, and irritable combat style when he joined Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary forces during the revolution against Spain. Prior to turning himself in to the Americans in 1899, he was promoted from private to major. After serving six months in prison, he was released and sent back to Manila. Filipinos regard Quezon as the country's second President after Aguinaldo, despite the fact that Emilio Aguinaldo's revolutionary Republica Filipina was not recognized by other countries. Quezon is known as the "Father of the Republic of the Philippines" and the "Father of Filipino Independence" because of his efforts to encourage the Philippines' independence from the American administration. The Filipino people's peaceful suffrage has elevated him to that eminent position twice. When he speaks, he does so as more than just the official representative of his country. He speaks as the undisputed leader of a race that has pushed him to the top for the last two decades. make a reflection about this please I need this​</h2><br />

At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.

Aside from health risks, these front liners are also a mistreatment subject from violators. Thus, this study is conducted during the pandemic and gathered data through a phone interview. It is conducted to explore the lived experiences of Barangay Tanods and how they adjusted to the drastic change in the work environment, health risk exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. It also determines the specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they cope. Lastly, it aims to map out how these experiences and impacts will improve preparations and the development of policing strategies in future crises. Moreover, three major conclusions emerge from this study's findings:(1) Barangay tanods faced difficulties in the sudden shift of their work environment (2) Most of the barangay tanods received incentives from the government to supply their health and sanitary needs (3) Barangay tanods reflected on their experiences to further improve as public servants and to be prepared for future crisis.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This article, published in the Belitung Nursing Journal, presents a qualitative phenomenological study on the experiences of Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses working in COVID-19 intensive care units in Dubai, UAE. The study aimed to explore the challenges and experiences faced by these nurses during the pandemic. The study was conducted using a Husserlian phenomenological approach, and data was collected through in-depth interviews with eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals.</p><p></p><p>The study findings revealed four major themes: Challenges During the Pandemic, Patient Care during COVID-19, Adapting to Change, and Resilience Amidst the Pandemic. The challenges faced by the nurses included being away from home, caring for COVID-19 patients, and fear of the unknown. Patient care during COVID-19 involved caring for critically ill patients, and the nursing profession was identified as a subtheme. Adapting to change involved living in the new normal and protecting oneself from COVID-19. Finally, resilience amidst the pandemic involved being with others and seeing oneself.</p><p></p><p>The study concludes that despite the challenges faced by these OFW nurses, including cultural differences and homesickness, they were able to continue working and adapt to the changes brought about by the pandemic. The study suggests that further research is needed to explore the experiences of OFW nurses in other countries and to identify strategies to support their mental health and well-being during the pandemic.</p><p></p><p>Another qualitative study on the experiences of Barangay Tanods (community police officers) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines was also reviewed. This study explored how these front liners adjusted to the drastic change in their work environment, exposure to COVID-19, and the threat of danger caused by different factors during community quarantine. The study aimed to determine specific challenges in the work environment and the changes in policing strategies, and how they coped. The study found that Barangay Tanods faced difficulties in the sudden shift of their work environment, but most received incentives from the government to supply their health and sanitary needs. The study concludes that these experiences and impacts will improve the preparations and development of policing strategies in future crises.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            25. Jane, who is now 19 years old, has lived with her grandparents since she was a month old. Her parents worked in Japan as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs). They do, however, keep in touch practically every day via social media. Her grandparents and parents describe her as a person who is picky about the friends with whom she forms tight bonds. Her grandparents saw that she chooses friends who share her characteristics and demonstrate the principles she espouses. She understands, however, that she cannot choose her family or the individuals with whom she will have to work in school and at her future workplace. Her pal describes her as a straightforward but discreet girl who is caring, fun to be around, insightful, and even filled with life's wisdom despite her young age. Her friends also noted that she respects her friends' individuality and treats them as equals, but always with the utmost respect. She does not take things subjectively, but rather objectively and based on facts, and she also researches. She is not judgmental and can connect with people from all walks of life. Her grandparents also noticed that the majority of her friends are 20 years older than she is. How would you characterize Jane's philosophical self? Back up your claim.​</h2><br />
