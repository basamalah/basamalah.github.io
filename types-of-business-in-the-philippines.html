Additionally, salary-based wages are easier to budget for, as they are more consistent. Cons: Salaried employees may not always be motivated to work hard, as they are not always rewarded for their effort. Additionally, salary-based wages may not always be enough to cover the cost of living.</p><p></p><p>Bonuses: Bonuses are additional payments that are made to employees as a reward for their good performance. Pros: Bonuses are a great way to reward employees for their hard work, and they can be a great incentive for employees to stay with a company. Additionally, bonuses can be used to attract and retain valuable employees. Cons: Bonuses can be costly for businesses, and they may not always be the best way to motivate employees.</p><p></p><p>Benefits: Benefits are additional payments or services that are provided to employees to help them with their daily living expenses. Pros: Benefits can be a great way to attract and retain employees, as they provide additional financial security and stability. Additionally, benefits can help to increase employee morale, as they are a sign of appreciation from the employer. Cons: Benefits are often costly for businesses, and they may not always be appreciated by employees. Additionally, some benefits can be difficult to manage and enforce.</p><br />

                        Technopreneurs, Social Entrepreneurs, Intrapreneurs, and Extrapreneur In The Philippines<p>The <strong>social entrepreneur </strong>will be the area of specialization that rules the Philippine market. Because a social entrepreneur creates organizations that are either established up as for-profit corporations or as not-for-profit corporations, much like a business entrepreneur. According to the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, they propel social innovation and transformation in a number of industries, including education, health, the environment, and business development. They have the power to ameliorate societal issues in our nation. Although it could be a drawback for some, social entrepreneurs benefit from it because of the additional opportunities it presents.</p><p></p><p>The next type of entrepreneur is an <strong>extrapreneur</strong>, a hybrid of an intrapreneur and an entrepreneur. According to Kristof de Wulf, extrapreneurs are people outside the firm who care about the brand so much that they impulsively engage in entrepreneurial activities for it. Extrapreneurs are those that think creatively or innovatively, which means they do not simply concentrate on internal organizations while seeking for solutions to their challenges, but also conduct an extra study in other businesses. The next person is the <strong>intrapreneur</strong>, who, in accordance with Murray Newlands, is a member of a business that takes risks in an effort to address a specific issue.</p><p></p><p>They play a significant role in raising productivity within businesses. Making decisions for the organization and the business is very difficult and dangerous. Creativity and productivity come naturally to intrapreneurs. Their contributions to a company's ideas are quite beneficial and can assist the enterprise's success. The Technopreneurs come last. According to Universiti Kuala Lumpur, <strong>technopreneurs</strong> are business owners whose primary enterprises involve sectors with a focus on technology. According to US Legal Inc., these people are known as "new age entrepreneurs" because they employ technology to develop fresh, cutting-edge items that they can sell to consumers and profit from. In the same way that their products benefit people by raising their standard of living, businesses generate money as they create new or inventive products.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about entrepreneurs here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/16982992#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />
