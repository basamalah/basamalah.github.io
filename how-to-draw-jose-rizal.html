                        <p><strong>Answer: José Rizal</strong></p><p><strong>Philippine National Hero and Ophthalmologist</strong></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p><strong>José Rizal (1861-1896) is one of the most revered figures in Philippine history. He was a multifaceted intellectual and a political activist, best known for his political writings that inspired the Philippine revolution and ultimately led to his execution by the Spanish colonizers. Rizal was also a physician who trained in ophthalmology under 2 prominent European ophthalmologists, Louis de Wecker and Otto Becker.</strong></p><p><strong>Rizal has become a symbol of the Philippine struggle for independence, and he is known there as a national hero. December 30, the date of Rizal's execution in 1896, is celebrated as a national holiday in the Philippines. Jose Rizal College was dedicated to his honor in Manila in 1919. There are commemorative monuments to Rizal in Manila near the site of his execution in Luneta Park, in his hometown, and most Filipino towns, in Heidelberg, and Chicago. His portrait appears on the Filipino 2-peso bill. The region around Manila, including his hometown of Calamba, was designated a province and named Rizal. His novels are required reading for Filipino high school students. Jose Rizal can perhaps be best summarized using his own words from the poem he wrote from his cell the night before his execution. One of the last stanzas of "Ultimo Adios" (Final Farewell) shows his selfless devotion to his country, his loyalty to his family, his deep spirituality despite criticism of the church, and his artistic grace.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
