However if you are not sure about it you can check below about the 4 reading types.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Skimming</strong>, sometimes referred to as gist reading, means going through the text to grasp the main idea. The reader doesn’t pronounce each and every word of the text but focuses their attention on the main theme or the core of the text. </p><p></p><p><strong>Examples of skimming</strong> are reading magazines or newspapers and searching for a name in a telephone directory.the reader quickly scuttles across sentences to get to a particular piece of information. </p><p></p><p><strong>Scanning</strong> involves the technique of rejecting or ignoring irrelevant information from the text to locate a specific piece of information.</p><p></p><p><strong>Intensive reading</strong> is far more time-consuming than skimming and scanning as it needs the reader’s attention to detail. It involves close reading that aims at the accuracy of comprehension. Here, the reader has to understand the meaning of each and every word.</p><p></p><p><strong>Extensive reading</strong> lays more emphasis on fluency and less on accuracy. It usually involves reading for pleasure and is more of an out-of-classroom activity. It is highly unlikely for readers to take up the extensive reading of text they do not like.</p><p></p><p>Hope it helps! </p><br />

Alternative Learning Journal,12(6),99-111.</p><p></p>Further explanation:<p>Because APA 7th is an <strong>"author/date" system</strong>, your in-text references for all types of media (books, journal articles, and digital documents) should include the author(s) last name and the year of publication.</p><p></p><p>Formatting also improves the reader's accessibility to the content by splitting information into sections and giving them headings, highlighting key phrases or concepts using bold, italics, or lists, and creating a powerful first impression (professional look and feel, appropriate font choice for the document type). Expository, persuasive, narrative, and descriptive writing are the four main types of writing. Each of these writing techniques has particular language traits and goals. In many academic texts, you will need to use many types.</p><p></p><p>The most often used citation styles are APA and MLA, but CMS is also used; it's just less common among undergraduates. It is advisable to be aware that CMS is typically used in situations involving academic publishing and traditional book publishing if you are composing a post-graduate thesis. Four things are necessary for writing to be effective: audience recognition, goal clarification, message development, and style and tone choice.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about citation here:</strong> brainly.ph/question/2457726#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
