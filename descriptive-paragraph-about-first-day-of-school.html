For the first four days I was completely alone. I don’t think I even spoke to a single person. Finally, at lunch on the fifth day, Karen Watson approached me and sat down next to me. Even though I was new, I had already figured out who Karen Watson was. She was popular. Pretty soon all of Karen’s friends were sitting right there next to me. I never became great friends with Karen, but after that, it seemed like all sorts of people started becoming my friend. You cannot convince me that Karen did not know what she was doing. I have a great respect for her and I learned a lot about what a true leader is. What pattern of paragraph development is used in this example? *1 pointA. NarrativeB. Process.C. DescriptiveD. Argumentative10. In front of me on the table sat a beautiful pure white bowl, simplistic in design, hiding a decadent surprise inside. In the bowl was hidden something that was not so pure, however, the irresistible indulgence was worth every calorie that I knew it contained. As I looked inside I saw on the bottom of the bowl a hot, tender brownie loaded with macadamia nuts. I knew from past experience that the nuts had a creamy and smooth texture, almost like white chocolate. On top of the brownie were two firmly packed scoops of ice cream, laying side by side, each one a different flavor. What pattern of paragraph development is used in this example? *1 pointA.

Learning how to ride a bike for the first time was a nerve-racking independent moment. I was about five years oldwhen my sister informed me that I was too old to still be riding a bike with training wheels. That was the timedecided not to depend on them anymore Even though I had some doubt my sister and I went outside and startedto take the little wheels off my bike3 The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale.

Finally, there are all kinds of speciafees added onto the bill at registration time.5. Last week, our class planted some bean seeds in ice-cream cups. We watered the seeds. After that we placedthe cups on the windowsill in the sun. About five days later, we observed that some of the seeds were beginningto germinate. A few days later, the plants had started to sprout leaves. By the end of the week, they were aboutseven centimeters tall​</a>

Here is the perfect system for cleaning your room. First, move all of the items that comhave a proper place to the center of the room.

Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodiesof water, but oceans are very large bodies of salt water, while lakes are much smaller bodies of freshwater. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plantsand animals living in them. The ocean is home to the largest animals on the planet, whereas lakes supportmuch smaller forms of life. When it is time for a vacation, both will make a great place to visit and enjoy3. I haven't been to Bali, Indonesia, but I have read about it. I have been to Boracay Island,that's why I know these two tourist destinations are similar in many ways. Both are small islands that havefive beachers, hillside terraces and cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisinesbecausepeople from all over the world visit them. However, Bali's beaches are golden while those of Boracay arewhite and the sand is fine as powder. A village in bali is famous for its golden and silver work. There is noneof this in Boracay. There is a cultural center in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shopswhere you can buy goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.4. I do well in school, and people think I am smart because of it. But it's not true. In fact, threeyears ago I struggled in school. However, two years ago I decided to get serious about school and made afew changes. First, I decided I would become interested in whatever was being taught, regardless of whatother people thought. I also decided I would work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. 1decided to never, never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. Afterimplementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions. Then my test scoresbegan to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made fun of me because "I was smart." Howexciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply a matter of working hard and being interested. After all,learning a new video game is hard work even when you are interested. Unfortunately, learning a new videogame doesn't help you get into college or get a good job.5.

                                            Let Us Try Read each of the items carefully and identify the text type. Write D if it is Descriptive and N if it is a narrative. 1. The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When I finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is not something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg; however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. 2. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attack. It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed it then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of school. To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the worst day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relaxed and peaceful. When I want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars.PS:Descriptive paragraph - describes a thing, a person, or a place. Narrative paragraph - tells a story or an event. (should be arrange chronologically-time order, that is in order in which they have happened) ​</a>

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

For the first four days I was completely alone. I don’t think I even spoke to a single person. Finally, at lunch on the fifth day, Karen Watson approached me and sat down next to me. Even though I was new, I had already figured out who Karen Watson was. She was popular. Pretty soon all of Karen’s friends were sitting right there next to me. I never became great friends with Karen, but after that, it seemed like all sorts of people started becoming my friend. You cannot convince me that Karen did not know what she was doing.

I haven't been to Bali, Indonesia, but I have read about it. I have been to Boracay Island,that's why I know these two tourist destinations are similar in many ways. Both are small islands that havefive beachers, hillside terraces and cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisinesbecausepeople from all over the world visit them. However, Bali's beaches are golden while those of Boracay arewhite and the sand is fine as powder. A village in bali is famous for its golden and silver work. There is noneof this in Boracay.

I also decided I would work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. 1decided to never, never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun.

                            7. Let Us Try Read each of the items carefully and identify the text type. Write D if it is Descriptive and N if it is a narrative. 1. The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When I finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is not something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg; however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. 2. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attack. It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed it then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of school. To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the worst day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relaxed and peaceful. When I want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars.PS:Descriptive paragraph - describes a thing, a person, or a place. Narrative paragraph - tells a story or an event. (should be arrange chronologically-time order, that is in order in which they have happened) ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Tells a story or an event (should be arrange chronologically time orde, that is in order in which they have happend)</p><br />

                            8. Directions: True or False: Write True if the sentence is correct and False if it is not. NOTE: All answers must be in CAPITAL  Directions: Read the following excerpts (from essays) carefully. Then on the space provided before the number, write N if the paragraph is Narrative, D if Descriptive, E if Expository, and P if Persuasive.6. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
