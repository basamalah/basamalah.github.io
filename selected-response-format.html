Follow the suggested format in writing statistical mini- research paper.Procedure:1. The mini- research study will be done individually. Can be handwritten, printed or electronic submitted in 8.5” by 11” size of bond paper.2. Select a random sample among the Grade 10 learners applying the Slovin's Formula and the systematic random sampling method.3. Distribute the set of questions to proper and target participants and gather their responses.4. Contact the teacher to avoid problems in computation and interpretation of the gathered information. If you wanted to do jt yourself, make sure to apply the measures of central tendency, measures of position and other statical methods in analyzing your data.5. If you have arrived at a conclusion or generalization from the data you gathered, work on writing on the body of the paper and finalize the conclusion.6. Re- read and proof- read your work upod finalizing and the prepare for the written report of the research.7. Present your research and illustrate how the measures of the position has applied in the process of arriving at the conclusion/generalization.​</a>

1. It allows certain files and folders to be shared with everyone or with selected users.
2. Files and folders can be configured to allow network users to copy them, but not alter them in their original
location, which is a common safety precaution.
3. Individual users are responsible for their own resources and can decide which data and devices to share.
4. The network has no central point of control or administration.
5. Files and folders can also be assigned a "read/write" status that allows either selected users or all users on

9. Great concern is placed on the disposal of large volumes of waste known as "techno trash".
10. Because of the negative impact posed by the improper disposal of electronic devices, it is crucial that people

11. Every computer relies on an operating system.
12. As a technician, there will come a time when the installation of an operating would be required as part of
one's work.
13. Change of password is part of quick solution.
14. Keeping the network room clean and changing air filters often is crucial in a preventive maintenance plan
for networks.
15 Since network issues could be simple or complex, the technician should determine the numbers of computers
on the network that are affected in order to assess how complicated the problem is.
16. By eliminating one problem at a time, the technician develops a consistent and logical method for resolving
networks problems.
17. In its physical form, the computer is just a collection of different materials like plastic, metal and glass.

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

Cultivation is an activity that can change the physical and chemical properties of the soil, but it does not directly affect the formation of the soil. Cultivation refers to the process of preparing and using land for the purpose of growing crops, which can lead to soil erosion, compaction and chemical changes but it is not the main factor that influence soil formation.<br /><br />pa brainliest po ty </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>E. biotic factors</p><p></p><p>Soil formation is influenced by several factors, including:</p><p></p><p>A.

Identify the technique used to discover the themes in the data below.
In a study of birth planning in China, Greenhalgh (in Ryan and Bernard, 2003) surveyed 1,011 ever-married women, gathered social and economic histories from 150 families. She conducted in-depth interviews with
present and formal officials (known as cadres), and collected documentary evidence from local newspapers, journals and other sources. Greenhalgh notes that "Because I was largely constrained from asking direct
questions about resistance, the informal record of field notes, interview transcripts, and questionnaire data contains few overt challenges to state policy." Greenhalgh concludes, however, that their conversations with
the researchers, both peasants and cadres made strategic use of silence to protest aspects of the policy they did not like. Cadres, for example were loathe to comment on birth-planning campaigns; peasant women were reluctant to talk about sterilization. These silences form one part of the unofficial record of birth planning in the villages. More explicit protests were registered in informal conversations. From these interactions
emerged a sense of profound distress of villagers forced to choose between a resistance that was politically risky and a compliance that violated the norms of Chinese culture and of practical reason.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.	Is the main character relatable to you? (Cite some qualities that make you similar or different.)  </strong></p><p>The main character, the older brother is not exactly relatable to myself, however, as he shows concern and love for his own brother, I am too. He takes care of his brother not only presently but for the future. Compared to myself, I am like this also since I do have siblings and I have to think about their well-being.<strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>2.	Is the setting effective or useful making you visualize the scenes? (Cite some lines that appeal to your senses)  </strong></p><p>Not exactly because the settings are from ancient years and it is quite hard to imagine the scenarios with words that are quite obsolete. However, the lines that goes like: So that night the younger brother went to his silo, gathered a large bundle of wheat, and climbed the hill that separated the two farms and over to his brother’s farm. Leaving the wheat in his brother’s silo, the younger brother returned home, feeling pleased with himself. So in this case, it is easy to reimagine it. <strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>3.	Is the plot interesting? (Cite aspects of it that make it good or dull.)
</strong></p><p>The plot provides a moral story about family however, as a story, it is rather tedious. There is no actual plot, the plot is not interesting there is no challenge. It isn’t even an interesting anecdote. <strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>4.	Is the conflict clear and realistic? (Indicate if it is something that people are likely to experience in life.)  </strong></p><p>Actually, the conflict is not qualified as a conflict. In fact, conflict does not seem to appear in the story. Also, it is not realistic. Though, the familial values are realistic, the plot and supposed conflict is not. <strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>5.	Is the theme relevant to human experiences? (Instead of an explanation, write the theme you inferred from each story.)
</strong></p><p>Yes, it is indeed relevant to human experiences. Families look out after each other. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/9304380</p><br />
