Teenage Vaping
It's no secret that vaping is growing in popularity across the nation and world.
Kids and teenagers are exposed to these dangerous e-cigarettes at a young age, and
an alarming percentage of students have vaped. Young people quickly become
addicted to the chemicals in the liquids used in vaping, and in some unfortunate cases,
some adolescents have died as a direct result of vaping.
To solve this growing issue, students and parents must first be educated on the
negative health effects. One answer is for schools to hold assemblies or prevention
programs that discuss the short-term and long-term health risks of vaping and e-
cigarettes. It would also be a good idea to invite parents to this school-wide assembly
so that they are also aware of the risks. Students need to understand the reality and
seriousness of these health concerns so that they can make the smart decision not to
vape.

                                            A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</a>

                            14. Let’s Apply
Teenage Vaping
It's no secret that vaping is growing in popularity across the nation and world.
Kids and teenagers are exposed to these dangerous e-cigarettes at a young age, and
an alarming percentage of students have vaped. Young people quickly become
addicted to the chemicals in the liquids used in vaping, and in some unfortunate cases,
some adolescents have died as a direct result of vaping.
To solve this growing issue, students and parents must first be educated on the
negative health effects. One answer is for schools to hold assemblies or prevention
programs that discuss the short-term and long-term health risks of vaping and e-
cigarettes. It would also be a good idea to invite parents to this school-wide assembly
so that they are also aware of the risks. Students need to understand the reality and
seriousness of these health concerns so that they can make the smart decision not to
vape.

                            24. A good thesis statement has several qualities: 1. A thesis statement is always framed as a declarative statement. Poor example: What is plagiarism? Improved version: Plagiarism can be explained from cultural and socio-political perspectives. 2. A good thesis statement is focused, meaning it provides supporting points that strengthen the main claim. Poor example: An effective local government unit should have good communication facilities and efficient re- source management programs since these initia- tives will be beneficial for its citizens. Improved version: Effective dissemination of information and effi- cient resource management are indicators of ef- fective local governance. 3. A good thesis statement has clear boundaries. It sets limits as to what the essay intends to explore. Poor example: Guitar playing skills can be improved if the player is dedicated and there are sessions devoted to technique and investments on good equipment must be considered since these will be influential in performing in front of an audience. Improved version: Excellent guitar playing requires countless hours of practice, strategic decisions in purchasing equipment, and tireless dedication.​</h2><br />
