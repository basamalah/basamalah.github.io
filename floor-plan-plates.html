10. If subduction takes place at convergent boundaries, and mountain ranges are built
along mid-ocean ridges, what do these plate movements imply about the surface area
of the Earth?
a. The subduction of plates means that Earth is becoming smaller.
b. The continual formation of new rocks in the ocean floor means that Earth must be
getting larger.
c. The movement of plates means that Earth is rebuilding itself in a cyclic phase and
therefore may change in dimensions and magnitude in the future.
d. The Earth has a constant surface area, thus, when new land is created at the ridge
between plates, the same amount of land created must be absorbed into the earth at
subduction zones.

Magnitude uses a "Ricther Scale" to define the total size of the earthquake or Crustal plates. Intensity is always written in Roman Numerals. For Example: I, II, III, IV, and etc.                     Intensity Scale in Romal Numerals <p>I - 1 = Scarcely Preceptible</p><p>II - 2 = Slightly Felt</p><p>III - 3 = Weak</p><p>IV - 4 = Moderately Strong</p><p>V - 5 = Strong</p><p>VI - 6 = Very Strong</p><p>VII - 7 = Destructive</p><p>VIII - 8 = Very Destructive</p><p>IX - 9 = Devastating</p><p>X - 10 = Completely Devastating</p>Reading Materials for Earthquake
