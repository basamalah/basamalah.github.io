There are 3 suspects, her ex husband who sold and collects firearm and lives in france but was found 2 blocks away from the scene but he claims it ain’t him because he just arrived in the country for a day and she been pronounced dead for 2 days. There her side lover, Charles, who was very obsessive over her. The passage claims that she had gotten a restraining order against him because he would visit her too often. Her husband found out about the affair, and after that, Charles was jobless and homeless. They also found that he had a spare of keys around his neck of Ms. Huffington’s house. He claims he didnt do it because he was visiting family around that time. The last suspect is her neighbor.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Worldwide, it appears that parliamentarians are struggling to meet the ever growing expectations of citizens. Data suggests that citizens hold parliamentarians to account principally for the services that they are able to deliver outside parliament, not for their law-making role or their ability to oversee the Executive.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Constituency service" is the general term for what parliamentarians do to serve and represent the interests of their constituents. Constituency service exists in many different forms, both in constituency-based electoral systems and also in list-based systems. Discussions with parliamentarians show the extent to which their capacity to deliver is being stretched to the limit, and might be taking them away from their parliamentary duties.
