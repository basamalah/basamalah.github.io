                                            QUESTION: What are the premises in the manifesto?
[Based on the context]
The University of the Philippine Center for Integrative and Development Studies Program on Alternative Development (UP CIDS AltDev), with civil society organizations, grassroots communities, and scholar-activists across Southeast Asia and the globe, condemns the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2020. Nothing but a weapon to silence criticism and dissent toward the government, the proposed Bill is a threat to the fundamental constitutional rights of the Filipino people.
The Bill grants absolute power to the state and its repressive apparatuses such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to violate the Philippine Constitution and human rights. It harbors a vague definition of terrorism which permits the malicious tagging of activists, critics, and organizations as affiliates of so- called terrorist groups. Furthermore, the Bill undermines whatever “safeguard” it has by giving free rein to the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) to determine what constitutes “a serious
risk to public safety” and the act to “incite others” to commit terrorism. This paves the way for the warrantless arrest of members of civil society designated as “terrorist.” This may paralyze the broad grassroots movements and alternative practices engaged by communities and civil society organizations that counter the state’s aggressive, profit- oriented vision of development. No one is safe.
We believe that it is imperative that we put an end to terrorist activities. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of those who have been victimized by acts of lawless violence. However, arming the government with punitive instruments and granting them a wide latitude of discretion, which the proposed bill provides, is not the answer. History will tell how current and past regimes have exhausted various means to amass political power through anti-people policies, as exemplified by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who wore the same “anti-terrorism” veneer to quell critics and dissenters. Suffice to say, the “Terror Bill” does not and will not address the root causes of terrorism which is poverty and the corruption of power.
As scholars and activists, we cannot stand by as we lay witness to the passage of this bill, especially under the current regime which has not been shy to use violence against the weak, powerless and the poor. We believe that addressing terrorism must not be addressed through punitive and draconian measures. Quelling terroristic activities is built through a comprehensive approach towards attaining peace, social justice, equity with the genuine participation of its people. We do not need to further arm the coercive apparatuses of the state which has operated with impunity and has grotesquely performed its duties with abuses. In order to end terrorism, what our society needs are real opportunities for its people, schools for its children, protection for peoples across races, sexes, and genders, an end to discrimination and violence, and genuine, open and transformative conversations in our pursuit of development to be free from terrorism, the entire Philippine nation, and the rest of the world, must get rid of poverty, marginalization and vulnerabilities. We need and demand for socio-politico-economic transformation attuned to people’s aspirations and voices, not another gauntlet to further strangle the Filipino peoples.</a>

                                            The lesson is an overview on the music of the Highlands and Lowlands of Luzon. Through the lessons, one will discover how the people from the different parts of Luzon express their feelings towards each other and the environment, their history, and their supernatural beliefs through the medium of the voice and/or musical instruments. A group performance inspired by examples of music from Luzon will culminate the educational experience. During the administration of Pres. Corazon C. Aquino, Executive Order 220 was ratified on 15 July 1987 to create the only landlocked region in the Philippines, the Cordillera Administrative Region, otherwise known as CAR. It is composed of SIX provinces, namely, Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mt. Province, with two cities, Baguio City, a highly urbanized city in Benguet and the regional center, and Tabuk City, a fifth-class city and the capital of Kalinga. The term "cordillera" was borrowed from Spanish word "cordilla" or "cuerda" which means "cord," "rope" or "chain." Hence, "cordillera" literally is an extensive chain of mountains or mountain ranges traversing the northern part of Luzori. This region is the majestic home to numerous ethnic peoples who are known for their unique culture most specifically for their music. music is very much a way of life. Indeed, it evidently reflects on every detail Their love of of their life cycle from birth to death and back. Consequently, their music is communal and participatory frequently performed in groups where all members of the ili are welcome and encouraged to join in the singing/chanting, dancing, and playing of the musical instruments. The songs/chants are sung in glottal or at other times in nasal registers, and these are also sung in solo or in leader-choir styles. Fortunately, the Cordilleran culture is one of the most colorful identities of the Philippines to be proud of and to reckon with. These traditions are on their way to extinction due to the modernization of the way of life among the youth of the Cordillera region. Less and less of the young generation are taught, learning the traditional music of their forefathers. Other threats to their music and most especially, their way of life are the conflict between state policies and their ancestral rights on land ownership, "mega-tourism", militarization, and the shift from manual farming to machine-processed farming. Despite all these, several non governmental organizations and international organizations like UNESCO ensure the protection not only of the rich culture and tradition of the Cordillera region but also of their people. Hudhud Ni Aliguyon - Chant Intro The Hudhud consists of narrative chants traditionally performed by the Ifugao community, which is well known for its rice terraces extending over the highlands of the northern island of the Philippine archipelago. It is practised during the rice sowing season, at harvest time and at funeral wakes and rituals. On the other hand, showcasing the rich oral traditions of the collective Cordilleran culture, it is through these narratives such as Hudhud, Owiwi, Sangsangit that the values and ethos of their forefathers and ancestors are handed down on them.LETS DO IT 1.)

                                            People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia. Today, it is limited to the southern region of the country.9Christianity was introduced as early as the 16th century with the coming of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521.10Protestantism was introduced by the first Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who arrived with the American soldiers in 1899.11Two Filipino independent churches were organized at the turn of the century and are prominent today. These are the Aglipay (Philippine Independent Church) and the Iglesia Ni Kristo (Church of Christ) founded in 1902 and 1914, respectively. Recently the Aglipay signed a covenant with the Anglican Church. The Iglesia ni Kristo has expanded its membership considerably. Its churches, with their unique towering architecture, are landmarks in almost all important towns, provincial capitals, and major cities.ASSESSMENT 2: Do as instructed. 2a.

                            3. QUESTION: What are the premises in the manifesto?
[Based on the context]
The University of the Philippine Center for Integrative and Development Studies Program on Alternative Development (UP CIDS AltDev), with civil society organizations, grassroots communities, and scholar-activists across Southeast Asia and the globe, condemns the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Bill of 2020. Nothing but a weapon to silence criticism and dissent toward the government, the proposed Bill is a threat to the fundamental constitutional rights of the Filipino people.
The Bill grants absolute power to the state and its repressive apparatuses such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police to violate the Philippine Constitution and human rights. It harbors a vague definition of terrorism which permits the malicious tagging of activists, critics, and organizations as affiliates of so- called terrorist groups. Furthermore, the Bill undermines whatever “safeguard” it has by giving free rein to the Anti-Terror Council (ATC) to determine what constitutes “a serious
risk to public safety” and the act to “incite others” to commit terrorism. This paves the way for the warrantless arrest of members of civil society designated as “terrorist.” This may paralyze the broad grassroots movements and alternative practices engaged by communities and civil society organizations that counter the state’s aggressive, profit- oriented vision of development. No one is safe.
We believe that it is imperative that we put an end to terrorist activities. Our hearts and sympathies go out to all of those who have been victimized by acts of lawless violence. However, arming the government with punitive instruments and granting them a wide latitude of discretion, which the proposed bill provides, is not the answer. History will tell how current and past regimes have exhausted various means to amass political power through anti-people policies, as exemplified by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos who wore the same “anti-terrorism” veneer to quell critics and dissenters. Suffice to say, the “Terror Bill” does not and will not address the root causes of terrorism which is poverty and the corruption of power.
As scholars and activists, we cannot stand by as we lay witness to the passage of this bill, especially under the current regime which has not been shy to use violence against the weak, powerless and the poor. We believe that addressing terrorism must not be addressed through punitive and draconian measures. Quelling terroristic activities is built through a comprehensive approach towards attaining peace, social justice, equity with the genuine participation of its people. We do not need to further arm the coercive apparatuses of the state which has operated with impunity and has grotesquely performed its duties with abuses. In order to end terrorism, what our society needs are real opportunities for its people, schools for its children, protection for peoples across races, sexes, and genders, an end to discrimination and violence, and genuine, open and transformative conversations in our pursuit of development to be free from terrorism, the entire Philippine nation, and the rest of the world, must get rid of poverty, marginalization and vulnerabilities. We need and demand for socio-politico-economic transformation attuned to people’s aspirations and voices, not another gauntlet to further strangle the Filipino peoples.</h2><br />

                            4. The lesson is an overview on the music of the Highlands and Lowlands of Luzon. Through the lessons, one will discover how the people from the different parts of Luzon express their feelings towards each other and the environment, their history, and their supernatural beliefs through the medium of the voice and/or musical instruments. A group performance inspired by examples of music from Luzon will culminate the educational experience. During the administration of Pres. Corazon C. Aquino, Executive Order 220 was ratified on 15 July 1987 to create the only landlocked region in the Philippines, the Cordillera Administrative Region, otherwise known as CAR. It is composed of SIX provinces, namely, Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mt. Province, with two cities, Baguio City, a highly urbanized city in Benguet and the regional center, and Tabuk City, a fifth-class city and the capital of Kalinga. The term "cordillera" was borrowed from Spanish word "cordilla" or "cuerda" which means "cord," "rope" or "chain." Hence, "cordillera" literally is an extensive chain of mountains or mountain ranges traversing the northern part of Luzori. This region is the majestic home to numerous ethnic peoples who are known for their unique culture most specifically for their music. music is very much a way of life. Indeed, it evidently reflects on every detail Their love of of their life cycle from birth to death and back. Consequently, their music is communal and participatory frequently performed in groups where all members of the ili are welcome and encouraged to join in the singing/chanting, dancing, and playing of the musical instruments. The songs/chants are sung in glottal or at other times in nasal registers, and these are also sung in solo or in leader-choir styles. Fortunately, the Cordilleran culture is one of the most colorful identities of the Philippines to be proud of and to reckon with. These traditions are on their way to extinction due to the modernization of the way of life among the youth of the Cordillera region. Less and less of the young generation are taught, learning the traditional music of their forefathers. Other threats to their music and most especially, their way of life are the conflict between state policies and their ancestral rights on land ownership, "mega-tourism", militarization, and the shift from manual farming to machine-processed farming. Despite all these, several non governmental organizations and international organizations like UNESCO ensure the protection not only of the rich culture and tradition of the Cordillera region but also of their people. Hudhud Ni Aliguyon - Chant Intro The Hudhud consists of narrative chants traditionally performed by the Ifugao community, which is well known for its rice terraces extending over the highlands of the northern island of the Philippine archipelago. It is practised during the rice sowing season, at harvest time and at funeral wakes and rituals. On the other hand, showcasing the rich oral traditions of the collective Cordilleran culture, it is through these narratives such as Hudhud, Owiwi, Sangsangit that the values and ethos of their forefathers and ancestors are handed down on them.LETS DO IT 1.)

                            6. People and ReligionDepartment of Tourism1The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American, Spanish, and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 76.5 million 
as of May 2000, and it is hard to distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. 
From a long history of Western colonial rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders, evolved a people of a unique blend of east and west, both in 
appearance and culture.2The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language, with English considered as the country's unofficial one.3The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic regional and cultural groups.4The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the appearance and culture of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.5Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their Western visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.6The Spaniards introduced Christianity (the Roman Catholic faith) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith.7The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. The Philippines is currently the third-largest English speaking country in the world.8Historically, the Filipinos have embraced two of the great religions of the world - Islam and Christianity. Islam was introduced during the 14th century shortly after the expansion of Arab commercial ventures in Southeast Asia.
