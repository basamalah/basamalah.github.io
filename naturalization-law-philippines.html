                                            Under Philipppine law, when a woman is guilty of adultery she commits a crime, while for a man,
the crime is not adultery but concubinage. In our country, there is one set of laws for women, and
another set of laws for men, which shows that laws in the Philippines are patriarchal in nature and seem
to favor men over women.
This double standard is not only seen in our laws, but in Philippine society as well, where one
set of rules seems to prevail for women, while another set of rules seem to prevail for men.
This short story explores the issue of infidelity and how it affects the family. Although there is
only one perspective found in this story, there seem to be different perspectives about infidelity that can
be picked up from the actions and words of the other characters. One should read this story closely as

1. Why does it seem acceptable in Philippine society for husbands to have affairs with other women?
2. Is it acceptable for women? Why or why not? What do you think or feel about this?
3. Should this attitude be changed? Why or why not?</a>

                            15. Under Philipppine law, when a woman is guilty of adultery she commits a crime, while for a man,
the crime is not adultery but concubinage. In our country, there is one set of laws for women, and
another set of laws for men, which shows that laws in the Philippines are patriarchal in nature and seem
to favor men over women.
This double standard is not only seen in our laws, but in Philippine society as well, where one
set of rules seems to prevail for women, while another set of rules seem to prevail for men.

The Legislative Branch enacts legislation, confirms or rejects the President appointments, and has the authority to declare war. The Philippine Congress is the highest law in the country. Senate - The Senate shall consist of twenty -four Senators to be elected to large number of qualified Philippine voters, as may be provided by law. The qualifications to become a senator, as stated in the constitution, are: 1. a natural born citizen of the Philippines; 2. at least thirty -five years of age; 3. can read and write 4. a registered voter; at 5. a resident of the Philippines for at least two years prior to election day.It is worth noting that the composition of the Senate is smaller in number as compared to that of the house of representatives.

Explain your answer.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Section 7, Article VIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution states that "No person shall be appointed Member of the Supreme Court or any lower collegiate court unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines." This means that in order for someone to be appointed as a member of the Supreme Court or any lower collegiate court, they must be a natural-born citizen of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>To change the qualification of a member of the Supreme Court or any lower collegiate court from a natural-born citizen to a citizen of the Philippines, an amendment to the Constitution would be required. The process for amending the Constitution is outlined in Section 1 of Article XVII of the Constitution, which requires that any proposed amendment be passed by a three-fourths vote of all the members of Congress and ratified by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite.</p><p></p><p>It is worth noting that amending the Constitution is a difficult task and requires a lot of political will and support, so it is unlikely that it would happen easily.</p><br />
