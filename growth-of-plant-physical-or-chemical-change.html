Soil pH is biological property of the soil that influences the solubility and availability of soil nutrients and activity of soil microorganisms. 7. Legumes like peanut have narrow C/N ratio while corn stover has wide C/N ratio which implies that former will decompose slower than latter. 8.

                        <p>1.scientific method
</p><p>A series of steps designed to help you solve problem and answer questions is called a scientific method.
</p><p></p><p>2.The scientific method has five basic steps, plus one feedback step:
</p><p>Make an observation.
</p><p>Ask a question.
</p><p>Form a hypothesis, or testable explanation.
</p><p>Make a prediction based on the hypothesis.
</p><p>Test the prediction.
</p><p>Iterate: use the results to make new hypotheses or predictions.</p><p>3.The first step in the Scientific Method is to make objective observations. These observations are based on specific events that have already happened and can be verified by others as true or false. Step 2. Form a hypothesis.
</p><p>4.COLLECT INFORMATION BY MAKING OBSERVATIONS. -Gather background information on the problem, and make many observations, information obtained by using the senses. FORM A HYPOTHESIS. -Utilize your observations to form a hypothesis, a testable explanations for the problem.
</p><p>5.An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated.
</p><p>6.It is when you decide whether or not the hypothesis is accepted or rejected based on the data you have gather.
</p><p>7.s a reminder, here are the steps to the method:
</p><p>Identify the problem. The first step in the scientific method is to identify and analyze a problem. ...
</p><p>Form a hypothesis. ...
</p><p>Test the hypothesis by conducting an experiment. ...
</p><p>Analyze the data. ...
</p><p>Communicate the results.</p><p>8.applying</p><p>9.Essentially, a control variable is what is kept the same throughout the experiment, and it is not of primary concern in the experimental outcome. Any change in a control variable in an experiment would invalidate the correlation of dependent variables (DV) to the independent variable (IV), thus skewing the results.

                            16. TRUE OR FALSE. Write True if the statement is correct and if False, change the word or group of words to make the statement true . 2 points each. 1. The soil possesses physical, chemical and biological properties which influence its capacity to supply nutrients to plants. 2. Essential elements include N, P, K, Ca, Mg. Al, and Na. When soil test value of a particular nutrient is low, the probability of obtaining a response to application of that nutrient to crops is relatively high. 3. Essential elements can be substituted with another similar element when it becomes deficient in the soil. 4 Biofertilizers are organic fertilizers like compost which contains and release nutrients essential for plant growth. 5. Cation exchange reaction can take place between the soil and soil solution and between the soil and plant leaves. 6. Soil pH is biological property of the soil that influences the solubility and availability of soil nutrients and activity of soil microorganisms. 7. Legumes like peanut have narrow C/N ratio while corn stover has wide C/N ratio which implies that former will decompose slower than latter. 8. Liebig’s Law of the Minimum state that the amount of plant growth and yield is not influenced by the nutrients present in the soil. 9. Soil fertility evaluation is a process by which nutritional problems are diagnosed and fertilizer recommendations are made. 10. In a soil chemical test, the amount of nutrient in the soil extract can be quantified simply by looking at intensity of the color formed in the sample solution.​</h2><br />
