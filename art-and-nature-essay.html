                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Art is not nature because by common consent people are not nature for many purposes.</p><p>Everyone realizes, of course, that people are as much a part of nature as anything else. And yet, for many purposes we want to make a distinction.</p><p>Is that dam natural or man made? Don’t put that in your garden it is not natural.</p><p>Did you carve that tree branch like that or is it natural?</p><p>people are 100% nature and yet more unlike the rest of nature than anything else on earth.</p><p>So, the things people make are considered not natural in any context that smacks of machine or tool assistance or knowledge in the making.</p><p>In art, it is the modern tools and civilization that really make the work not considered natural.</p><p>People from cultures that are not industrial or modern are considered far more natural than city folk.</p><p>It is not entirely logical or scientific but the distinction is natural and useful.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My Artistic Experience</p><p></p><p>Art, whether it is something we see or hear, is, in my perspective, all around us. There has always been art. I adore art and consider myself to have a highly artistic outlook on life. In terms of my personal life, I am quite relaxed and "in the present." I spend my life with passion. I believe that art is the same way. When creating art, things frequently go astray. This is how life is as well. Our lives are works of art in and of themselves, evolving into what we envision. I am fortunate to have had wonderful life experiences. As I tie my art works to my personal experiences as well as the nature of art. Nature can be represented in art in a variety of ways, from photorealism to abstraction. By graphically replicating objects as they appear in real life, art can imitate nature. Your imagination can imitate nature, and art can imitate nature.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Salamat!</p><br />

Digital Camera</p><p><strong>D.</strong></p><p>10.<strong> </strong>Photo Essay</p><p><strong>D.</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.<strong> Relief printmaking </strong>is one of the simplest types of printmaking, in which material is carved or taken away from around the protruding design that is to be printed so that only the design appears.</p><p>2.<strong>  Balance </strong>is the distribution of the visual weight of objects, colors, texture, and space. </p><p>3.The principles of design are the rules a designer must follow to create an effective and attractive composition. The fundamental principles of design are Emphasis, Balance and Alignment, Contrast, Repetition, Proportion, <strong>Movement</strong> and White Space. Design differs from art in that it has to have a purpose.</p><p>4. When applied to mass-produced commercial products, such as fabrics, this process is called <strong>silk screen</strong>. When an artist designs, makes, and prints his own stencil to produce a fine print, it is called screen-printing (formerly serigraphy), and the product is called a screen-print.</p><p>5. <strong>Repetition</strong>: the repeated use of particular elements of visual arts to create a pattern, movement, <strong>rhythm</strong>, or unity . Variety: the use of the elements of visual arts to create differences in an artwork for visual interest </p><p>6.The world's first photograph—or at least the oldest surviving photo—was taken by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in <strong>1826</strong> or<strong> 1827</strong>. Captured using a technique known as heliography, the shot was taken from an upstairs window at Niépce's estate in Burgundy.</p><p>7. A photograph (also known as a photo) is an image created by light falling on a photosensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic image sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are created using a smartphone/camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating such images is called photography.
</p><p>8.  I do not know this I'm sorry</p><p>9.  <strong>Digital cameras</strong> bring a new level of enjoyment to picture taking and have numerous advantages, many of which were simply not possible with an ordinary film camera. Digital cameras are more convenient than film cameras, and since buying and developing film are not necessary, operating costs are lower.</p><p>10. A <strong>photographic essay</strong> is a form of visual storytelling, a way to present a narrative through a series of images. A great photo essay is powerful, able to evoke emotion and understanding without using words. A photo essay delivers a story using a series of photographs and brings the viewer along your narrative journey.</p><p></p><br />

                            24. Make an essay  discussing the nature of ICT in the context of their lives, society, and professional tracks (Arts, Tech-Voc, Sports, Academic)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>ICT is useful and helpful.Through ICT we can easily communicate to other people, easily gain information and the most important is that, we can increased our leisure time as it makes our work done in less time. Another effect of ICT in our society is that, It gives people opportunity to work in their home. This would result a decreased traffic pollution from people who are no longer commuting to go to their work.Another thing is the introduction of home shopping over the internet. We’ll no longer bother going to the closest mall or store to buy our things. This is also an advantage for those people who cannot leave their houses for some reasons. Best example is the physically disabled person who’s currently relying on other people to do their shopping. Internet shopping could allow these people to be more independent and less reliant on others. </p><p>In business, ICT helps companies to expand their business through the use of Internet and ICT help our society to grow more business, It give people’s opportunity to work even they are in their home and also reducing to the need of travel into their works or offices. It can also help other big company to expand their business through the use of social media, dealing with their clients through internet.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>REFLECTION ABOUT ICT</strong></p><p>As  a student I always attach with a lot of essential things in my life, ICT help me for my studies and to communicate other, my family living away from me. Everyday I need a internet connections even I’m in the school because if there are words that I can’t understand, It’s easier to me to research to internet.  In my chosen professional track (ABM) it help me to understand our lesson through the use of ICT.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>CARRY ON LEARNING</strong><strong>BRAINLYSS ME</strong><p></p><br />
