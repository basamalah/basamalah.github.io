                                            How Identical Is Identical?     Everyone knows that identical twins look alike, night? Not quite. Although it may be very hard to tell identical twins apart, no two people are exactly the same even identical twins. Identical twins develop from the same fertilized egg, so they share the same genes. Genes contain the information that determines people's physical traits. While most people have their own unique set of genetic instructions, identical twins are unusual because they both have the same set. But researchers have discovered that those instructions do not tell the entire story. The environment in which each twin grows and develops also affects many aspects of their physical appearance and personality. Even small differences can have considerable effects. Fingerprints are a good example. One might assume that identical twins have the same tingerprints. But detectives have known for many years that this is not the case. Like snowflakes, no two fingerprints are alike. Unique pattems on the tips of the fingers appear as the child develops in the womb. While genetic instructions are the primary influence on fingerprint pattems, researchers have discovered other factors that also have an impact. The rate of bone growth, or environmental factors such as pressure in the mother's womb and contact with fluid, can also affect the developing twins' fingerprint patterns. So even though two twins grow next to each other in the womb, they experience slightly different environments. As a result, they develop slightly different fingerprints.1. According to the author, the fact that twins do NOT have identical fingerprints prove that_________.A.they are not actually twinsB.no two people are exactly alikeC.genetic patterns do not affect appearanceD.twins often have different personalities2. Which of the following is NOT  an environmental factor that can still affect fingerprint patterns? *A.contact with fluidB.rate of bone growthC.pressure in the wombD. how twins are raised3. Evidence in the passage suggests that_______.A.twins often have the same thoughtsB.the shape of snowflake is determined by genesC.environmental affects people more than their genes doD.genetics and environment affect growth4. Evidence in the passage suggests that the physical differences between identical twins are usually_______.A.significantB.impossible to determineC.measured after birth D.small5.

During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin initial interactions that involve learning theother's personal style and work habits. He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized bymusings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and visibility, the mentor embodies asfantasized role model with whom the protégé begins to identify and develops positive expectations about careerdevelopment. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then progresses to the cultivation phase, in whichcareer development, role modeling and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and protégé deepens and intimacy increasesduring this phase. This phase may last from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentorpromotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor, and the mentor gains loyalty and supportof the protégé and feelings that his or her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the8​</a>

                            7. How Identical Is Identical?     Everyone knows that identical twins look alike, night? Not quite. Although it may be very hard to tell identical twins apart, no two people are exactly the same even identical twins. Identical twins develop from the same fertilized egg, so they share the same genes. Genes contain the information that determines people's physical traits. While most people have their own unique set of genetic instructions, identical twins are unusual because they both have the same set. But researchers have discovered that those instructions do not tell the entire story. The environment in which each twin grows and develops also affects many aspects of their physical appearance and personality. Even small differences can have considerable effects. Fingerprints are a good example. One might assume that identical twins have the same tingerprints. But detectives have known for many years that this is not the case. Like snowflakes, no two fingerprints are alike. Unique pattems on the tips of the fingers appear as the child develops in the womb. While genetic instructions are the primary influence on fingerprint pattems, researchers have discovered other factors that also have an impact. The rate of bone growth, or environmental factors such as pressure in the mother's womb and contact with fluid, can also affect the developing twins' fingerprint patterns. So even though two twins grow next to each other in the womb, they experience slightly different environments. As a result, they develop slightly different fingerprints.1. According to the author, the fact that twins do NOT have identical fingerprints prove that_________.A.they are not actually twinsB.no two people are exactly alikeC.genetic patterns do not affect appearanceD.twins often have different personalities2.

What is the difference between personality behaviour and attitude?3. What is the Stress?4. As a student how can you avoid stress?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Balance responsibilities (like schoolwork) with activities you enjoy (like relaxing or spending time with friends). It's all about balance: all work and no play is bad. But if your schedule is so crammed with activities that there's no time for homework, that'll stress you out too.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. Manage responsibilities. Use a calendar or planning app to keep track of assignments, chores, practices, and other obligations. Of course, planning is no good if you don't actually do what you plan: Managing stress also means regular studying, keeping on top of assignments, and overcoming procrastination. Take time to reflect a bit every day and think about how things are going. What do you need to work on? Do? Make time for?</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. Eat healthy foods. What you eat affects your mood, energy, and stress level. Eating healthy doesn't mean avoiding all treats — it goes back to that balance thing again. It's OK to treat yourself to ice cream occasionally if you ate a salad or turkey on whole wheat for lunch. But if ice cream and sweets are your main source of fuel, you're likely to crash or feel cranky — and stressed!</p><p></p><p></p><p>4. Get proper sleep. This may seem like a no-brainer. After all, who doesn't love to sleep? But getting the right amount of sleep is actually something we need to focus on because it's easy to let homework, talking to friends, or binge watching get in the way of sleep — no matter how much we want to catch those ZZZs.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>5. Make time to exercise every day. It's hard to feel anxious when you're taking deep breaths on a run, feeling the rush of a downhill bike ride, or playing a pickup game with friends. Exercise doesn't just take our mind off of stress; it releases chemicals in our brains that make us feel better.</strong></p><p><strong>physical, cognitive development, and psychosocial.</strong></p><p><strong>1. Knowing more about your unique personality can help you be happier by first telling you how you're most comfortable based on your personality preferences and second how best to play to your own strengths and address your own weaknesses, whether that be in your career, in your free time or in your relationships </strong></p><p>2.  </p><p>The main difference between personality and attitude is that the personality refers to the combination of one’s qualities, character traits, principles, cognition, etc. whereas the attitude refers to the standpoint or the opinion one has towards something.</p><p>3. Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous.</p><p>4.Avoid high-fat, high-sugar foods and go easy on the caffeine. This is one of the best things you can do to reduce stress. Exercise produces endorphins, the feel-good chemicals that act as natural painkillers, and it also improves sleep, which in turn reduces stress. Try walking, jogging, or yoga.</p><p>Get Enough Sleep. </p><p></p><p>Practice Visualization. </p><p></p><p>Exercise Regularly. </p><p></p><p>Take Calming Breaths. </p><p></p><p>Practice Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) </p><p></p><p>Listen to Music. </p><p></p><p>Get Organized. </p><p></p><p>Eat a Healthy Diet.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Then, copy and complete the table thatfollows in your answer sheetKram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature over time, providing different levels ofmentoring functions as they progress through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation, andredefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin initial interactions that involve learning theother's personal style and work habits. He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized bymusings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and visibility, the mentor embodies asfantasized role model with whom the protégé begins to identify and develops positive expectations about careerdevelopment. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then progresses to the cultivation phase, in whichcareer development, role modeling and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and protégé deepens and intimacy increasesduring this phase. This phase may last from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentorpromotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor, and the mentor gains loyalty and supportof the protégé and feelings that his or her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the8​</h2><br />
