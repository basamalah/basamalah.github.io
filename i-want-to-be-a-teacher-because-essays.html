All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals. That has made me the person I am today.
	One of these goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly, confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a fun sport to do. With all of this information, you can conclude that this sport is important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</a>
