Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans, upon his hoe and gazes on the ground.the emptiness of ages in his face, And on his back the burden of the world. 3.

He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or i friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work ! carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would 1 1 starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good- 1 tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to ! try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. - I would like to go on a journey for I adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. -I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. 1 i --The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. - They say Pra Ruang of ! Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime 1 i later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He ! I walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. - Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. -I'm so thirsty. - Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into 1 a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy.-Who are your 1 father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. -I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? ! How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra 1 1 i Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. - You are a i very determined boy! said the woman || Come along with me Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a I lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. -Where did the boy come from? ! the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. - How old is he? the king asked further. 1 -12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, i said the king. -Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie -​</a>

                                            The Crow and the SparrowOnce upon a time a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day when they were Hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers,” said the crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see who can eat the Most.” “All right!” answered the sparrow. “Then the one who wins will eat the other,” said the crow. The sparrow laughed and agreed for he thought the crow was joking. Friends do Not eat each other. The sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated. For each Pepper that he ate, he hid three more under the mat without the sparrow’s seeing.“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” said the crow. Then at last the sparrow realized that the crow was serious. “All right,” he said, “I’ll keep my promise. But before you eat me you must wash Your beak for everyone knows that you’re a dirty bird and eat lots of nasty things.” So the crow went to the river and cried. “River! River!Give me water To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The river replied: “You want water? Very well, but everyone says you eat nasty Things. If you want to wash your beak in my water, you must get a pot to put it in and then You can have as much water as you like.”The crow went to the potter in the village and cried: “Potter! Potter! Make me a pot To fetch some water. To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The potter replied: “You want a pot? Very well, but I have no clay. Bring me some clay and “I’ll make you a pot.”The crow went to a field and began digging up clay with his beak. The earth said: “The whole world knows that you eat rubbish and nasty things. I cannot allow you to dig Up my clay unless you use a spade.”The crow went to the village blacksmith, who was working on a wheel. The crow Said to him: “Blacksmith! Blacksmith! Make me a spadeTo dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak,To make myself neat,The sparrow to eat!” The blacksmith replied: “You want a spade? Very well, but you see I have no fire In the forge. If you want me to make a spade, you must bring me some fire.”The crow went to a farmer’s house nearby. The farmer’s wife was cooking rice in The courtyard. The crow cried:“Dear farmer’s wife! Give me fire To make a spade To dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The farmer’s wife replied: “You want fire? Very well, but how will you carry it?” “You can put it on my back,” said the crow.The farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and immediately his feathers burst Into flames. The greedy crow was burnt to ashes. But the honest sparrow lived to a ripe Old age.​</a>

                                            Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation.According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, warning of animpending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damagedboats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty.Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Lovelooked around with hope.Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, “Prosperity,could you please take me in your boat?”“No,” replied Prosperity, “my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver.There is no place for you.”A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, “Could youhelp me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you.”Vanity responded haughtily, “No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet.”Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was to noavail. “No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself.”When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. ButHappiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned about anyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out, “ComeLove, I will take you with me.” It was an elder.Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, “Do you know who sogenerously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?”Knowledge smiled, “Oh, that was Time.”“And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?” Love wondered.Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, “Because only Time knows yourtrue greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and greathappiness in this world.”What is the plot of this po? Please answer. Thank you.​</a>

Read the story, then enumerate the events by filling im the graphic organizer below Makato and the Cowrie Shell (A Thai Folktale) by Supanee KhanchanathitiOnce upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. - What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. -The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. -Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. I'm so thirsty. -Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy. -Who are your father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Mon? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. You are a very determined boy! said the woman.||Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. - Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. -How old is he? the king asked further. -12 years old, your Majesty, replied thhe mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. -Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrieSANA PO MASAGOT, ASAP. </a>

Before they left, their mother told them " Whatever you do , do it the best that you can because that's the way to get along in the world.The first little pig built his house out of straw because it was the easiest thing to do. The second little pig built his house out of sticks. This was a little bit stronger than a straw house. The third little pig built his house out of bricks.One night the big bad wolf, who dearly loved to eat fat little piggies, came along and saw the first little pig in his house of straw. He said "Let me in, Let me in, little pig or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin", said the little pig. But of course the wolf did blow the house in and ate the first little pig.The wolf then came to the house of sticks. "Let me in ,Let me in little pig or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in" "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin", said the little pig. But the wolf blew that house in too, and ate the second little pig.The wolf then came to the house of bricks. " Let me in , let me in" cried the wolf "Or I'll huff and I'll puff till I blow your house in" "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin" said the pigs. Well, the wolf huffed and puffed but he could not blow down that brick house.But the wolf was a sly old wolf and he climbed up on the roof to look for a way into the brick house.The little pig saw the wolf climb up on the roof and lit a roaring fire in the fireplace and placed on it a large kettle of water.When the wolf finally found the hole in the chimney he crawled down and KERSPLASH right into that kettle of water and that was the end of his troubles with the big bad wolf.The next day the little pig invited his mother over . She said "You see it is just as I told you. The way to get along in the world is to do things as well as you can." Fortunately for that little pig, he learned that lesson. And he just lived happily ever after!ACTIVITY 1Check your understanding.1. What is the theme of the story? Explain your answer.​</a>

“All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.”
Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason
“And what more am I? I look for aid to the imagination. [But how mistakenly!] I am not the assemblage of limbs we call the human body; I am not subtle penetrating air distributed throughout all these members; I am not a wind, a fire, a vapor, a breath or anything at all that I can imagine. I am supposing all these things to be nothing. Yet I find, while so doing, that I am still assured that I am still something.”
Rene Descartes, Mediations on First Philosophy
“Look into the depths of your own soul and learn first to know yourself, then you will understand why this illness was bound to come upon you, perhaps you will 
thenceforth avoid falling ill.”
- Sigmund Freud, Character and Culture
“I discover that there are other minds in misunderstanding what other 
people say and do.”
- Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of the Mind
“Whether it’s a question of my body, the natural world, the past, birth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to phenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the extent that I take them up and live them.”

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work—carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied.

He wanted to try his luck in far–off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. ―What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. ―I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. ―I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. ―The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. ―They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind–hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month‘s journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. ―Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. ―I‘m so thirsty. ―Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you‘ve come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. ―Thank you so much, said the boy. ―Who are your father and mother? Haven‘t you any family? the old woman asked again. ―I come from the City of Mon over there, replied Makato. ―Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? ―I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. ―You are a very determined boy! said the woman.‖Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants‘ sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants‘ sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once withhis hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. ―Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. ―How old is he? the king asked further.―12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. ―A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. ―Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie (the photo is the last part of the story)​</a>

                                            A little Princess by Frances Hodgson BurnettBut Lottie was a determined little person. If Sara would not tell her where she lived, she would find out in some other way. She started late one afternoon on a voyage of discovery, climbing stairs she had never known the existence of, until she reached the attic floor. There she found two doors near each other, and opening one, she saw her beloved Sara standing upon an old table and looking out of a window. "Sara!" she cried, "Mamma Sara!" She was aghast because the attic was so bare and ugly. Sara turned round at the sound of her voice. What would happen now? If Lottie began to cry and any one chanced to hear. She jumped down from her table and ran to the child. "Don't cry and make a noise," she implored. "Isn't it?" gasped Lottie, and as she looked round it she bit her lip. She was a spoiled child yet, but she was fond enough of her adopted parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake. It was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might turn out to be nice. "Why isn't it, Sara? she almost whispered. Sara hugged her close and tried to laugh. She had a hard day and had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes. "You can see all sorts of things you can't see downstairs," she said. "What sort of things?" demanded Lottie, with the curiosity. "Chimneys-quite close to us-with smoke curling up in wreaths and clouds and going up into the sky-and sparrows hopping about and talking to each other just as if they were people-and other attic windows. It all feels as high up-as if it was another world." "Oh, let me see it!" cried Lottie. "Lift me up!" Sara lifted her up, and they stood on the old table together and looked out. The sparrows twittered and hopped. Two of them perched on the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until one pecked the other and drove him away.1. What did Lottie find when she reached the attic floor?2. How did Sara make Lottie curious? 3. What did Lottie fond of?4. What did they see from the window?5. Are these statement True or False:A.

They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</a>

GROW AND BE LIKE THE MOLAVE
by Manuel Luis quezon
National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It
is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component
parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of
vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave,
industrious, self-reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbeud with sound
patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and
I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from
trials and bitter strifes of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task
and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind.
The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and
valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in
proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights.
The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among
men.
It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly
they should be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited.
I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood,
the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength.
we are orientals. orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. in the world of humanity, we look upon a quit lake from which adventures and enteprising may reap enjoyment and gain. i refuse to allow filipinos to be so regarded.
we shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. through self discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.

He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work— carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, goodtempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far–off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. ―What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. ―I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. ―I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. ―The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. ―They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind–hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month‘s journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. ―Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. ―I‘m so thirsty. ―Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you‘ve come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. ―Thank you so much, said the boy. ―Who are your father and mother? Haven‘t you any family? the old woman asked again. ―I come from the City of Mon over there, replied Makato. ―Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn?

                                            Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation. According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, waming of an impending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damaged boats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Love looked around with hope Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, "Prosperity.could you please take me in your boat?" "No," replied Prosperity, "my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver. There is no place for you."A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, "Couldyou help me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you."Vanity responded haughtily, "No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet." Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was tono avail. "No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself."When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help.But Happiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned aboutanyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out "Come Love, I will take you with me." Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, do you know who so generously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?"Knowledge smiled, "Oh, that was Time.""And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?" Love wondered. Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, "Because only Time knows your true greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and great happiness in this world."​</a>

                                            “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</a>

Once upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. - What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. -The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. -Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. I'm so thirsty. -Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy. -Who are your father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Mon? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. You are a very determined boy! said the woman.||Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. - Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. -How old is he? the king asked further. -12 years old, your Majesty, replied thhe mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. -Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie

                                            Guess At Least 3 Songs
" And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun
Then I left for college in September
And we wept 'cause we can't be together
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend, my old friend
Then I met this girl at graduation
And forget my oldest creation
And I guess I'll see him next vacation
Send my best, I send my best
And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun"
2. "I've been reading books of old
The legends, and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss"
3. "Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side"

                            6. The Crow and the SparrowOnce upon a time a sparrow made friends with a crow. One day when they were Hunting for food, the crow spied some red peppers that were spread out on a mat to dry. “Look at those peppers,” said the crow to the sparrow. “Let’s see who can eat the Most.” “All right!” answered the sparrow. “Then the one who wins will eat the other,” said the crow. The sparrow laughed and agreed for he thought the crow was joking. Friends do Not eat each other. The sparrow ate each pepper fairly, but the crow cheated. For each Pepper that he ate, he hid three more under the mat without the sparrow’s seeing.“I’ve won! Now I’m going to eat you!” said the crow. Then at last the sparrow realized that the crow was serious. “All right,” he said, “I’ll keep my promise. But before you eat me you must wash Your beak for everyone knows that you’re a dirty bird and eat lots of nasty things.” So the crow went to the river and cried. “River! River!Give me water To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The river replied: “You want water? Very well, but everyone says you eat nasty Things. If you want to wash your beak in my water, you must get a pot to put it in and then You can have as much water as you like.”The crow went to the potter in the village and cried: “Potter! Potter! Make me a pot To fetch some water. To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The potter replied: “You want a pot? Very well, but I have no clay. Bring me some clay and “I’ll make you a pot.”The crow went to a field and began digging up clay with his beak. The earth said: “The whole world knows that you eat rubbish and nasty things. I cannot allow you to dig Up my clay unless you use a spade.”The crow went to the village blacksmith, who was working on a wheel. The crow Said to him: “Blacksmith! Blacksmith! Make me a spadeTo dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak,To make myself neat,The sparrow to eat!” The blacksmith replied: “You want a spade? Very well, but you see I have no fire In the forge. If you want me to make a spade, you must bring me some fire.”The crow went to a farmer’s house nearby. The farmer’s wife was cooking rice in The courtyard. The crow cried:“Dear farmer’s wife! Give me fire To make a spade To dig some clay, To make a pot, To fetch some water, To wash my beak, To make myself neat, The sparrow to eat!” The farmer’s wife replied: “You want fire? Very well, but how will you carry it?” “You can put it on my back,” said the crow.The farmer’s wife put the fire on the crow’s back and immediately his feathers burst Into flames. The greedy crow was burnt to ashes. But the honest sparrow lived to a ripe Old age.​</h2><br />

                            7. Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation.According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, warning of animpending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damagedboats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty.Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Lovelooked around with hope.Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, “Prosperity,could you please take me in your boat?”“No,” replied Prosperity, “my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver.There is no place for you.”A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, “Could youhelp me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you.”Vanity responded haughtily, “No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet.”Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was to noavail. “No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself.”When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. ButHappiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned about anyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out, “ComeLove, I will take you with me.” It was an elder.Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, “Do you know who sogenerously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?”Knowledge smiled, “Oh, that was Time.”“And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?” Love wondered.Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, “Because only Time knows yourtrue greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and greathappiness in this world.”What is the plot of this po? Please answer. Thank you.​</h2><br />

Read the story, then enumerate the events by filling im the graphic organizer below Makato and the Cowrie Shell (A Thai Folktale) by Supanee KhanchanathitiOnce upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. - What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. -The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. -Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. I'm so thirsty. -Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy. -Who are your father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Mon? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. You are a very determined boy! said the woman.||Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. - Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. -How old is he? the king asked further. -12 years old, your Majesty, replied thhe mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. -Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrieSANA PO MASAGOT, ASAP. </h2><br />

                            11.            The Three Little PigsOnce upon a time there were three little pigs and the time came for them to leave home and seek their fortunes. Before they left, their mother told them " Whatever you do , do it the best that you can because that's the way to get along in the world.The first little pig built his house out of straw because it was the easiest thing to do. The second little pig built his house out of sticks. This was a little bit stronger than a straw house. The third little pig built his house out of bricks.One night the big bad wolf, who dearly loved to eat fat little piggies, came along and saw the first little pig in his house of straw. He said "Let me in, Let me in, little pig or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin", said the little pig. But of course the wolf did blow the house in and ate the first little pig.The wolf then came to the house of sticks. "Let me in ,Let me in little pig or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in" "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin", said the little pig. But the wolf blew that house in too, and ate the second little pig.The wolf then came to the house of bricks. " Let me in , let me in" cried the wolf "Or I'll huff and I'll puff till I blow your house in" "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin" said the pigs. Well, the wolf huffed and puffed but he could not blow down that brick house.But the wolf was a sly old wolf and he climbed up on the roof to look for a way into the brick house.The little pig saw the wolf climb up on the roof and lit a roaring fire in the fireplace and placed on it a large kettle of water.When the wolf finally found the hole in the chimney he crawled down and KERSPLASH right into that kettle of water and that was the end of his troubles with the big bad wolf.The next day the little pig invited his mother over . She said "You see it is just as I told you. The way to get along in the world is to do things as well as you can." Fortunately for that little pig, he learned that lesson.

“All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.”
Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason
“And what more am I? I look for aid to the imagination. [But how mistakenly!] I am not the assemblage of limbs we call the human body; I am not subtle penetrating air distributed throughout all these members; I am not a wind, a fire, a vapor, a breath or anything at all that I can imagine. I am supposing all these things to be nothing. Yet I find, while so doing, that I am still assured that I am still something.”
Rene Descartes, Mediations on First Philosophy

thenceforth avoid falling ill.”

“I discover that there are other minds in misunderstanding what other 
people say and do.”
- Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of the Mind
“Whether it’s a question of my body, the natural world, the past, birth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to phenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the extent that I take them up and live them.”

                            13. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time
Essay Topic: Learning at Home during Lockdown: My
Parents and My Teachers
is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

They say he is a very kind-hearted king. ―You are a very determined boy! said the woman.‖Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants‘ sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants‘ sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once withhis hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. ―Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. ―How old is he? the king asked further.―12 years old, your Majesty, replied the mahout. ―A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. ―Take good care of him.

                            16. A little Princess by Frances Hodgson BurnettBut Lottie was a determined little person. If Sara would not tell her where she lived, she would find out in some other way. She started late one afternoon on a voyage of discovery, climbing stairs she had never known the existence of, until she reached the attic floor. There she found two doors near each other, and opening one, she saw her beloved Sara standing upon an old table and looking out of a window. "Sara!" she cried, "Mamma Sara!" She was aghast because the attic was so bare and ugly. Sara turned round at the sound of her voice. What would happen now? If Lottie began to cry and any one chanced to hear. She jumped down from her table and ran to the child. "Don't cry and make a noise," she implored. "Isn't it?" gasped Lottie, and as she looked round it she bit her lip. She was a spoiled child yet, but she was fond enough of her adopted parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake. It was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might turn out to be nice. "Why isn't it, Sara? she almost whispered. Sara hugged her close and tried to laugh. She had a hard day and had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes. "You can see all sorts of things you can't see downstairs," she said. "What sort of things?" demanded Lottie, with the curiosity. "Chimneys-quite close to us-with smoke curling up in wreaths and clouds and going up into the sky-and sparrows hopping about and talking to each other just as if they were people-and other attic windows. It all feels as high up-as if it was another world." "Oh, let me see it!" cried Lottie. "Lift me up!" Sara lifted her up, and they stood on the old table together and looked out. The sparrows twittered and hopped. Two of them perched on the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until one pecked the other and drove him away.1.

They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</h2><br />

GROW AND BE LIKE THE MOLAVE
by Manuel Luis quezon
National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It
is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component
parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of
vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave,
industrious, self-reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbeud with sound
patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and
I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from
trials and bitter strifes of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task
and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind.
The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and
valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in
proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights.
The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among
men.
It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly
they should be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited.
I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood,
the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength.
we are orientals. orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. in the world of humanity, we look upon a quit lake from which adventures and enteprising may reap enjoyment and gain. i refuse to allow filipinos to be so regarded.
we shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. through self discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.

Learning Task 3: Read the story, then enumerate the events by filling in the graphic organizers below: Makato and the Cowrie Shell (A Thai Folktale) by Supanee Khanchanathiti Once upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work— carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, goodtempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far–off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. ―What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. ―I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. ―I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. ―The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. ―They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind–hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month‘s journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. ―Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. ―I‘m so thirsty. ―Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you‘ve come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. ―Thank you so much, said the boy. ―Who are your father and mother? Haven‘t you any family? the old woman asked again. ―I come from the City of Mon over there, replied Makato. ―Good heavens! Have you really come from Môn? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? ―I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. ―You are a very determined boy! said the woman.‖Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her.

                            23. Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation. According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, waming of an impending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damaged boats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Love looked around with hope Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, "Prosperity.could you please take me in your boat?" "No," replied Prosperity, "my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver. There is no place for you."A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, "Couldyou help me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you."Vanity responded haughtily, "No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet." Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was tono avail. "No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself."When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help.But Happiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned aboutanyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out "Come Love, I will take you with me." Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, do you know who so generously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?"Knowledge smiled, "Oh, that was Time.""And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?" Love wondered. Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, "Because only Time knows your true greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and great happiness in this world."​</h2><br />

                            24. “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged.

The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. According to the essay, the basis of national strength is the character of its citizenry. The author believes that a nation cannot be stronger than its parts, and its weakness is its failings, while its strength is its power. I partially agree with this statement because the citizenry's character is a crucial factor in a nation's strength, but it is not the only one. Factors such as the government, economy, and social structures contribute to a nation's strength.</p><p></p><p>2. The peaks, valleys, and deep chasms that could hinder the upward climb of humanity are the obstacles that prevent people from realizing their full potential, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, and conflicts. These obstacles hinder progress and development, requiring potent social upheavals.</p><p></p><p>3. The author wants the Filipinos to be solid and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning, or the storm, and confident of their strength. The author also wants the Filipino to be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited, and imbued with good patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness. I believe this goal can be achieved with proper education, training, and social support.</p><p></p><p>4. To achieve the author's perceived goal, we must possess self-discipline, courage, industry, self-reliance, purposefulness, patriotism, social ideals, and solid moral fibers. These values will enable us to develop our resources, advance our culture, promote social justice, and secure happiness and contentment for all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.</p><br />

Once upon a time, there was a boy whose name was Makato. He was an orphan, for his father and mother died when he was very young. He had no brothers, sisters, cousins or friends to take care of him, so he had to make a living for himself. He did every kind of work carrying heavy things, clearing away the forest, or feeding pigs. He never idled. Although he was paid only small wages, he was satisfied. He knew that if he would not work, he would starve. Wherever he went, his employers praised him for being sensible, hardworking, good tempered and cheerful. One fine evening after he had finished chopping up a big pile of wood, he sat down to rest and thought of all he would like to do in the future. He wanted to try his luck in far-off strange lands, for he longed for exciting adventures. - What are you thinking about so deeply, my boy? asked his employer. I would like to go on a journey for adventure, said Makato, pointing to the northeast. I heard that the land is fertile and the people are kind. I wish I could see the land for myself. His eyes sparked with excitement. -The land you wish to go to is called Sukhothai, said his employer. They say Pra Ruang of Sukhothai is a very kind-hearted king. You might be lucky if you could go there. Sometime later, Makato decided to try his fortune. He left his village and set out in the wide world. He walked along cheerfully, enjoying new insights and talking to the people he met on the way. After a month's journey, he reached a village on the boundary of the Kingdom of Sukhothai. -Please, can I have some water to drink? Makato asked an old woman with a big water pot on her head. I'm so thirsty. -Where did you come from? Why are you here alone? You look as if you've come a long way, said the old woman, pouring cold water from her pot into a small cup and handling it to Makato. -Thank you so much, said the boy. -Who are your father and mother? Haven't you any family? the old woman asked again. I come from the I City of Mon over there, replied Makato. -Good heavens! Have you really come from Mon? How is it that you are travelling alone, such a young boy as you are? I wanted to see Pra Ruang of Sukhothai, replied Makato. They say he is a very kind-hearted king. You are a very determined boy! said the woman.||Come along with me .Who knows? You might see Pra Ruang someday. Makato was glad to go with her. If he could work with this kind of woman, he would have a place to sleep, some food to eat and perhaps someday, he might be lucky enough to see the king. The old woman was one of the Pra Ruang Mahouts, which meant that she helped the mahout find the food for the elephant and clean out the elephants' sheds. He worked hard and well, and the mahout and his wife grew fond of him. One day, the sky was clear and the weather so fine, it seemed to Makato that it must be a lucky day. As he worked in the elephants' sheds, a tall young man in a splendid costume, followed by attendants, came in. It was Pra Ruang himself. Makato bowed low at once with his hands clasped together before him. His heart beat fast. - Where did the boy come from? the king asked the mahout, who was attending him. -How old is he? the king asked further. -12 years old, your Majesty, replied thhe mahout. -A good-looking and hardworking boy, said the king. -Take good care of him. As the king walked away, Makato saw a little cowrie

                            26. Guess At Least 3 Songs
" And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun
Then I left for college in September
And we wept 'cause we can't be together
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend, my old friend
Then I met this girl at graduation
And forget my oldest creation
And I guess I'll see him next vacation
Send my best, I send my best
And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun"
2. "I've been reading books of old
The legends, and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss"
3. "Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind
Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side"
