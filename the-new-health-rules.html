These initiatives are motivated by the Church's conviction that social and economic justice should come first and that population expansion is connected to development in general. The Catholic Church in the Philippines, to whom 85% of the population belongs, sees it as a problem primarily involving the care of individuals, and instead of focusing on external contraceptive control, it concentrates its efforts on internal human sexual control. In the 1960s, the church started a curriculum called Family Life Education.<p></p><p>2. <strong>Based on the news reports gathered, explain your position</strong> on the Catholic Church's contribution to reproductive health and the population increase in the Philippines.</p><p></p>The majority-Catholic nation also boasts one of Asia's fastest-growing populations and a sizable amount of chronic poverty. The Philippines has lagged behind as its neighbors have progressed faster.The church disagrees with economists who claim that rapid population expansion is a major contributing element. It asserts that people need work, not contraceptives, and that population growth is not a contributing factor to poverty.<p>3. <strong>Describe one key insight you have gained from this class.</strong></p><p></p>Only if fertility rates decline in a way that causes the young-age population to expand more slowly than the total workforce will the demographic window become available. Due to the Catholic hierarchy's extreme stance, the state is unable to address the problem effectively.<p></p><p></p><p>4. <strong>Think about how the following will benefit from your newfound knowledge:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a. your nation</strong></p>Our government must address the issue of reproductive health, and we must all work together to support our nation in doing so. We must completely abide by the law if we want to protect ourselves.<p></p><p><strong>b. your neighborhood</strong></p>By protecting ourselves with contraceptives, attending family planning classes, and taking care of other associated reproductive health issues, we should also support our barangay.<p></p><p><strong>c. your school</strong></p>We should be familiar with the fundamental facts about population increase, sexual health, and the many viewpoints and ideologies of the teachers and students in our school.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>d. one's family</strong></p>Parents that are well-informed can do a lot for their kids. We can stop overpopulation and poverty if both the mother and father are educated.
