Nangunguna sa mga dahilan ang "human error" kabilang ang pagmamaneho nang antok o lasing na nasa 75 porsiyento. Kaya naman, nagpayo ang pinuno ng grupo na si Alberto Suansing ukol sa ligtas na pagmamaneho. Una, hindi dapat nagte-tailgate o tumutok sa sasakyan sa harap. Sundin ang "one vehicle distance" sa sinusundang sasakyan sa kada 10 kilometro kada oras na bilis. Ikalawa, sundin din dapat ang speed limit sa mga kalsada, lalo't ito ang pinakatalamak na sanhi ng mga aksidente sa daan. Ikatlo, manatili sa tamang lane at ugaling magdahan dahan ng sasakyan habang papalapit ng intersection. Ikaapat. obserbahan ang "right of way" sa pagintersect at panghuli, dapat siguruhing nasa tamang kondisyon ang mga katawan at isipan bago bumiyaheA. Maka-develop ng episyenteng instrumento, kagamitan o produkto. B. Makadiskubre ng mga bagong kaalaman hinggil sa mga batid naC. Makakita ng mga sagot sa mga suliraning hindi pa ganap na nalutasD.

                                            Consider the intersection of two roads in a rapidly expanding suburban area. Both roads have two traffic lanes. Because of the development of the area, the volume of traffic flow at this intersection has dramatically increased and so have the number of accidents. A large proportion of the accidents involve vehicles making a left turn which suggests that the ‘simple’ traffic lights at the intersection are no longer adequate because they do not provide a left turn priority interval. The city’s traffic department is evaluating alternatives for upgrading these traffic signals so that such priority intervals are provided to assist left-turning drivers. The need is especially urgent for traffic that is flowing in the north and south directions. If the upgrade is implemented, then a particular parameter value that will need to be determined is the proportion of time allocated to the priority interval. 
The planning department has decided to explore solution alternatives for the problem by undertaking a modelling and simulation study.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What is Venn Diagram?</strong></p><p>A Venn diagram is a graphical representation that employs circles to depict relationships between objects or bounded groups of objects. Circles that overlap share characteristics, whereas circles that do not overlap do not. Venn diagrams are used to depict the relationship between different concepts visually.</p><p></p><p><strong>Changes and development in the human body</strong></p><p>Physical Changes in a human body or puberty is divided into distinct stages that affect the skeletal, muscular, reproductive, and practically all other body systems. During puberty, physical changes are slower and more stable. This is reassuring to many parents who believe their children's childhoods pass them by far too swiftly.</p><p>When and how much a child develops is determined by a number of factors, including how soon the child is to puberty. Between the ages of 6 and 8, there is usually a phase of slightly accelerated growth rate. A little amount of pubic hair, armpit hair, moderate acne, and/or body odor may occur as a result of this.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Changes and Development on Boys</strong></p>Boys are typically a year behind girls when it comes to puberty. The initial indicator is the growth of the testes, as well as thinning and reddening of the scrotum, which occurs at an average age of eleven years but can occur at any age between nine and fourteen. If a boy begins puberty before the age of nine, he should see a pediatrician. The peak growing period for boys occurs about two years after puberty begins. Consult your pediatrician if a guy is not showing indications of puberty by the age of 14.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Changes and Development on Girls</strong></p>Breast budding in females begins at the age of 10, while some girls begin as early as eight years old and others do not begin until they are thirteen years old.If a girl begins puberty before the age of eight, she should see a pediatrician.Girls reach their peak development period (in terms of height, weight, muscle mass, and other factors) roughly a year after puberty begins.Menstruation often begins 18 months to two years after puberty begins. The first menses usually begin just before a female reaches the age of thirteen.Consult your pediatrician if a girl is not showing indications of puberty by the age of 13.<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Changes and Development on both Boys and Girls</strong></p>Both girls and boys develop pubic hair in the same way. Hair grows in a limited area surrounding the genitals, and the first growth is long, soft hair. As the hair becomes longer and thicker, it becomes darker and coarser. Over time, pubic hair takes on the appearance of adult hair, although in a smaller region. It has the potential to expand to the thighs. It can occasionally make you feel sick to your stomach.Both boys and girls increase in height depending on  the genes and hormones<p></p><p>To know more about puberty, click here</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/6040205</p><p>To know more about development during adolescence, click here</p><p>https://brainly.in/question/7527652?tbs_match=1</p><p></p><p>Hope this helps! :)

But Euclid gave it a new definition and developed it into a formal study of statements that involve reasoning. He later introduced that mathematical system with four parts. The first one are terms which cannot be defined but can be described, this is called as the (2)_____________. It is composed with the point, line and plane. Second, are terms that have a proper definition and can be defined by means of other geometrical terms, this is called as the (3)____________. It is composed with the line segment, ray, opposite ray and angles. Third, are statements that are assumed to be true without any proof, this is called as the (4)_____________. And last, are basic geometric principle which are proven to be true, which is called as (5)___________.2nd question1. Points J, K, L and N are collinear points.2.

                            22. Consider the intersection of two roads in a rapidly expanding suburban area. Both roads have two traffic lanes. Because of the development of the area, the volume of traffic flow at this intersection has dramatically increased and so have the number of accidents. A large proportion of the accidents involve vehicles making a left turn which suggests that the ‘simple’ traffic lights at the intersection are no longer adequate because they do not provide a left turn priority interval. The city’s traffic department is evaluating alternatives for upgrading these traffic signals so that such priority intervals are provided to assist left-turning drivers. The need is especially urgent for traffic that is flowing in the north and south directions. If the upgrade is implemented, then a particular parameter value that will need to be determined is the proportion of time allocated to the priority interval. 
The planning department has decided to explore solution alternatives for the problem by undertaking a modelling and simulation study.
Scenario to be undertaken.
