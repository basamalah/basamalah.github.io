                            18. biographical analysis about Carlos bulosan "my father goes to court"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This story was narrated by a four-year old kid whose family lived in a small town on Luzon. The farm of his father was destroyed by a Natural Calamity, which is flood. That is the reason why they preferred to live in a new place. They had a rich man neighbor, his children rarely go outside. Their house so tall, where their family can watch the kid’s (narrator) house. The rich man’s servants were always cooking some delicious food, like fried chicken, ham, and bacon. The kid’s family inhaling the heavenly spirit of those foods.</p><p></p><p>The narrator’s family always bond outside the Sun and bathing in the river. They always had a good time and a contagious laugh, and some people join their bonding, while the rich man only watch them. As day past on, the rich man’s family had a problem. The children became thin, the wife had a cough like the rich man. There was an opposite effect in the narrator’s family, they became bright and healthy. Their sickness was not in the food, because their servants always frying something delicious to eat. After that, their house was always close, but the aroma of the food was still drifted by the wind.</p><p></p><p>One morning, a police man knocked on the door of the narrator’s house. The rich man had a complaint to them, because they were accused by stealing the spirit of the wealth and food.</p><p></p><p>When the trial came, the narrator’s family came first. After a few minutes, the rich man’s family came with a lawyer, their body was so thin and they look sick. The narrator’s father didn’t had any lawyer, he fight on his own. The trial starts, the lawyer questioned the narrator’s father. In the first question, the father didn’t agree that they stole the spirit of the wealth and the food. The father agreed in the second question, where he state that their family hung outside the rich man’s house and inhale the food. He also agreed that when the rich man’s family became sick, their family became strong and healthy.</p><p></p><p>The rich man’s children went in shyly. They are really thin and look like sick. When it is time for the rich man, the narrator’s father was the one who question him. The rich man agreed that while their family having fun, the rich man’s family became worse and sad and they also stole the spirit of their wealth. He also agreed that the narrator’s family stole the spirit of their food by hanging outside their windows while their servants cooking the food. The narrator’s father commit to pay the rich man, he took the straw hat and collect some centavo and silver coins around the courtroom. When the father is ready, he went to the rich man and shook the hat in front of the rich man. He asked the man if he heard the spirit of money, and the rich man agreed. In that case, the father told to the man that he had already paid. After that, the case was dismissed.</p><p></p><p>The judge told to the narrator’s father the story where his uncle died because of laughing. The judge like to hear narrator’s family laughing. The kid’s sisters started to laugh, and all of the people in the courtroom laughed and the judge’s laugh was the loudest of all.</p><p></p><p><strong>REVIEW</strong></p><p></p><p>Honestly, it was really a great story. I also join to their laughter at the end. It was really came from our Philippine Literature. I understand it more than other stories. Let us talk about the story, what can you say about the rich man? The reason why they look sick and pale is because they didn’t enjoy their life, look, he seldom make the children go outside. The other family, even though they are poor, they had a good bonding.</p><p></p><p>Carlos Bulosan was a really good author, not because he was a Filipino, but by his story. You can saw the Filipino skills to him, and Philippine Literature was really good.</p><p></p><p><strong>REFLECTION</strong></p><p></p><p>This story really gives you many lessons. First, don’t be afraid to the case that had been accused to you if you don’t have secrets. Second, just tell the truth. Third, you may not need a lawyer if you can fight by your own by just HONESTY. Fourth, don’t accused someone because you are more powerful than them and you are jealous to them. Lastly, just enjoy your life.</p><p></p><p>Accusing your fault to someone was really a bad thing to do, don’t ever do that. Here in Philippines, if you always laugh and laugh, it will makes your life even longer. I can relate some story in this one, rich family had everything but they don’t have the spirit of love in each other. In poor family they didn’t had thigs like the rich man but you can see the love in them.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan po sagot ko nagpakahirap ko pong sagutin yan sana naman po may brainliest yang sagot ko</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>"My Father Goes to Court" is a short story written by Carlos Bulosan that revolves around the themes of social class, justice, and identity. The story is set in the Philippines during the early 1900s, under the American colonial period.</p><p></p><p>The story follows the protagonist, a young boy who belongs to a poor family, as he accompanies his father, who is a tenant farmer, to court. His father has been summoned to court by his landlord, who accuses him of stealing a pair of carabaos (water buffalo). The boy's father is innocent and has no evidence to prove his innocence, and as a result, he feels scared and nervous.</p><p></p><p>The story highlights the social inequality that existed in the Philippines during the colonial period. The rich landlords held all the power and could easily manipulate the justice system to their advantage. The poor farmers had no voice and were often oppressed and exploited by their landlords.</p><p></p><p>As the trial proceeds, the boy's father becomes increasingly worried as he sees how the judge, the lawyers, and the landlords are all working together against him. The boy, however, sees the situation differently. He believes that his father is an honest man and that he deserves justice. He also sees how his father is being treated unfairly and how the landlords are using their power to oppress the poor.</p><p></p><p>The story reaches its climax when the boy decides to take matters into his own hands. He bravely stands up in court and accuses the landlord's son of stealing the carabaos. The boy's accusation is met with disbelief and scorn, but he stands his ground and refuses to back down. The judge, impressed by the boy's bravery, decides to investigate the matter further and eventually discovers that the landlord's son did indeed steal the carabaos.</p><p></p><p>In the end, justice is served, and the boy's father is exonerated. The story ends with the boy's father being hailed as a hero by his fellow farmers, and the boy realizing that he too has the power to stand up for what is right and just.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "My Father Goes to Court" is a powerful story that highlights the injustices of the social class system in the Philippines during the American colonial period. It shows how the poor were often oppressed and exploited by the rich and how justice could be manipulated to serve the interests of the powerful. The story also celebrates the power of courage and bravery in the face of injustice, as seen through the actions of the young boy who stood up for his father's innocence.</p><br />
