       ' Better World'
I dream that one day
Our voices will somehow fill the earth
With joy forever
I dream that someday
Our wishes will somehoe soon come true and last forever
I dream that one day our songs in some way
Will bring a bright tomorrow
Full of love
Full of hope full of joy
I see this one day
When all the world will hear us
That someday when all will stand before us
Singing one song together
Everywhere singing
We are gonna love you, people of the wirld
We are gonna make you a better world
We will all respect you, people of the world
We are gonna make you a better world.</a>

Talking To The Moon
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had
At night, when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh-oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh
At night, when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh-oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can</p><p>No need for greed or hunger A brotherhood of man</p><p>2. These lines explain that; What a wonderful world we will have if everything is free, away from greediness and hunger.</p><p>  - Agree, because our world in the present is democratic but the rulers are dictators and bcos of that we're like a prison in our own world that we forgot what is the meaning of freedom anymore.</p><p>3. For me it is very important for the reason that we live in an unfair and cruel world that we can't barely experience freedom because of many rules or lack of power to do what we want to do and we sometimes forget what is the purpose of our lives.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Just my own understanding and judgement bout this topic but hope it might help</p><br />

                            28. Just like I'm about to sink, just like I'm about to meltOnly the two of us at night in the vast skyIt was only a simple goodbyeBut it was all I needed to understandThe sinking sun, the rising night skyOverlaps with your figure behind the fenceEver since the first day we metYou stole my heartLike you were wrapped in fragile airYou had a lonely gazeIn the world always ringing with "tick-tocks," again and againTouching the heartless words and loud voicesEven if tears are about to spillIf it were the two of us togetherI'm sure mundane happiness could be foundIn the troubling days, for the never-smiling youI give my utmost love in hopes for the dazzling tomorrowIn the never ending night before we fallCome and take my handEven the days that you hid inside, wanting to forgetIt'll melt with the warmth of my embracesNo need to be afraid, until dawn comes somedayLet's be togetherI hate it when you stare at the things only you can seeLike you're captivated by it, or you're in loveI hate that expressionThe things I want to believe but I can't no matter what I doThey'll repeatedly appear, and every time, I'll get angry and cryEven so, some day we'll surely, we'll understand each otherI believe in it"I don't want this, I'm tired of it"I frantically reach for your handBut you push my hands away"I don't want this, I'm tired of it"To tell the truth, I want to say that, tooIn the world always ringing with "tick-tocks," again and againNone of the words I've prepared for you reached you"I want to end it all"When I went along and said thatYou smiled for the first timeIn the troubling days, I became unable to smileThe reflection of you in my eyes is truly beautifulThe overflowing tears on the never-ending nightAll dissolve into your smileIn the never-changing days when I criedYou seduce me with your tenderness towards the endJust like I'm about to sink, just like I'm about to meltThe staining fog dissipatesIn the days that I hide inside, wanting to forgetI take your hand as you extend it towards meIt's like the cold breeze is swimming through the skyBlowing through usDon't ever let go of my handThe both of us, racing into the nightYOASOBI - Racing into the Night/Yoru ni Kakeru (English Translation)This song is actually about suicide, it’ll make alot more sense if you go check out the music video.How do you feel after reading the lyrics? ​</h2><br />

Talking To The Moon
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had
At night, when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh-oh
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh
At night, when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh-oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
