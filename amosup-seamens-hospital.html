What is a main idea of “Wilbur and Orville Wright: Men with Wings”?
please help!
Along with the Wright brothers, five local seamen work together to test the plane.
The Wright brothers take turns at the controls as they test their gliders.
The Wright brothers invent the first motor-powered plane that can truly fly.
On the day of their test flight, the wind makes it difficult for the plane to take off.</a>

You are probably familiar with maps you used in school to study history and current events. These
are called political maps because they show the boundaries of the different countries. Can you
imagine what kind of map would show things like railroad tracks, football fields, fire towers, and oil
wells? These features appear on aerial maps, or maps pilots used to guide them in flight. From the
sky, a set of railroad tracks is a welcome clue to a lost flier.
Astronauts use celestial maps chart their position in space. Seamen use navigation maps to steer
their ships. You have probably seen a driver of a car pull out a road map showing the lay out of
streets and highways, or even used one yourself.
Map making began with primitive man drawing rough sketches on the ground. In early times, maps
had to be based only on what men had observed. Since methods of measuring and recording these
observations were not very advanced, many of the maps were inaccurate. Because of undiscovered
land, they were incomplete as well.
Today maps are still based to some extent on observation. But photography and telescope
astronomy now produce accurate maps for any traveler</a>

1. We have a new classmate. His name is Edison Dimagiba. He wears eyeglasses and he carries a lot of books in his bag. I thought he was smart and cute. But when he was asked to read “My stomach is aching” yesterday, he said, “May-sto-mats-is-aking.” My jaw almost fell to the ground. I was fooled by those glasses.
2. Alfred was shocked to see his idol “Zeratul,” a giant wrestler in WWE, with some tears in his eyes. Zeratul was announcing his retirement. Alfred could not believe that a big, muscular guy can cry. For him, real men never cry. 
3. Roberto Agustin, a 59-year-old OFW lost his job in Saudi because of the COVID19. He returned to his hometown in Palompon last summer. However, he has not found a new job since he arrived. He tried to apply as a carpenter, but the employers would just say he is too old and may not be able to perform his job.
4. Raynor, Sarah, and Tychus were about to go to the airport when they got stranded at the bus terminal because of the lockdown. After about a week without being able to change their clothes, they looked terrible and messy. When they finally reached the airport, they were not allowed to enter because the security guard thought that they were beggars.

Along with the Wright brothers, five local seamen work together to test the plane.
The Wright brothers take turns at the controls as they test their gliders.
The Wright brothers invent the first motor-powered plane that can truly fly.
On the day of their test flight, the wind makes it difficult for the plane to take off.</h2><br />
                        <p>The main idea of “Wilbur and Orville Wright: Men with Wings” is that Wilbur and Orville Wright invent the first motor-powered plane that can successfully fly, against the odds and with the help of a small team of dedicated people.</p><br />

                            17. Create a graphic organizer (15pts) and an outline (15pts) out of the text below.
You are probably familiar with maps you used in school to study history and current events. These
are called political maps because they show the boundaries of the different countries. Can you
imagine what kind of map would show things like railroad tracks, football fields, fire towers, and oil
wells? These features appear on aerial maps, or maps pilots used to guide them in flight. From the
sky, a set of railroad tracks is a welcome clue to a lost flier.
Astronauts use celestial maps chart their position in space. Seamen use navigation maps to steer
their ships. You have probably seen a driver of a car pull out a road map showing the lay out of
streets and highways, or even used one yourself.
Map making began with primitive man drawing rough sketches on the ground. In early times, maps
had to be based only on what men had observed. Since methods of measuring and recording these
observations were not very advanced, many of the maps were inaccurate. Because of undiscovered
land, they were incomplete as well.
Today maps are still based to some extent on observation. But photography and telescope
astronomy now produce accurate maps for any traveler</h2><br />
