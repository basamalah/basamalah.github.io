                                            The Princess and the Servant One day, there was a girl named Angelica. This little girl came from a wealthy family, she was the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Cruz who has the biggest and most successful business in town. Everything that Angelica wants was given to her. She is a beautiful and an intelligent girl. One morning while she was about to eat her breakfast, she saw a little girl named Anne same as her age, born with a poor family and wearing a white loose shirt and big shorts. Anne was simple and knows how to respect people with a kind heart. She was confused why this little girl was at their place. Angelica came closer to the girl and asked her who she is then she said “I am the daughter of your new maid” then Angelica replied, asking if she can play with her at the park. Anne smiled while being excited. While they are at the park Anne looked at Angelica wearing her beautiful pink dress and white shoes. She asked herself how this girl looked so beautiful playing while she was just wearing her cheap clothing. After that, these two girls began to be close with each other and became friends. Angelica likes Anne because of her sweet smile and kindness. They love playing their dolls and bonding with each other. When Anne saw what the bedroom of Angelica was like, she started to doubt her parents why they can’t give her the life like Angelica was living. She also started to have insecurities with Angelica, but she keep it her secret. That night before she sleeps, Anne thought about stealing one of Angelica’s clothes. She can’t sleep thinking how lucky Angelica is compared to her. One dark night, she started to steal her clothes and accessories while Angelica was asleep. After that, the sun already came out welcoming another day. Angelica was about to go to her school to study. While opening her closet she wondered why one of her accessory that was given by her dad was missing, the cabinet was open and her clothes were messy. She asked their maids if they saw her one accessory but no one knows where it is. The following day Angelica saw Anne being surrounded with other kids at the park. She wandered why this is happening but when she came closer to them, she saw that Anne was showing them the necklace that she said she bought. After Angelica witnessed this, she immediately called Anne and they went to a place where nobody can see or hear them. Here she asked calmly why Anne stole hey necklace. Anne said she was jealous of the life Angelica has and is devastated by the money her family has. Angelica understood her situation. After being stolen from, she didn’t get mad. Instead, she offers Anne the necklace and said “we are all the same no matter what the amount of our money is. As long as you don’t steal from others again, we can still be friends.” Anne was joyous once she heard that from Angelica and she swore to never steal again. They continued to be friends without telling the others of the situation they were in. For the next years of their life, they had accompanied one another as adults and started helping other children in need who are in the same situation as Anne when they were kids. They lived a life filled with love and support.PA HELP PLEASE :) Exposition: Rising Action:​</a>

                            6. The Princess and the Servant One day, there was a girl named Angelica. This little girl came from a wealthy family, she was the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Cruz who has the biggest and most successful business in town. Everything that Angelica wants was given to her. She is a beautiful and an intelligent girl. One morning while she was about to eat her breakfast, she saw a little girl named Anne same as her age, born with a poor family and wearing a white loose shirt and big shorts. Anne was simple and knows how to respect people with a kind heart. She was confused why this little girl was at their place. Angelica came closer to the girl and asked her who she is then she said “I am the daughter of your new maid” then Angelica replied, asking if she can play with her at the park. Anne smiled while being excited. While they are at the park Anne looked at Angelica wearing her beautiful pink dress and white shoes. She asked herself how this girl looked so beautiful playing while she was just wearing her cheap clothing. After that, these two girls began to be close with each other and became friends. Angelica likes Anne because of her sweet smile and kindness. They love playing their dolls and bonding with each other. When Anne saw what the bedroom of Angelica was like, she started to doubt her parents why they can’t give her the life like Angelica was living. She also started to have insecurities with Angelica, but she keep it her secret. That night before she sleeps, Anne thought about stealing one of Angelica’s clothes. She can’t sleep thinking how lucky Angelica is compared to her. One dark night, she started to steal her clothes and accessories while Angelica was asleep. After that, the sun already came out welcoming another day. Angelica was about to go to her school to study. While opening her closet she wondered why one of her accessory that was given by her dad was missing, the cabinet was open and her clothes were messy. She asked their maids if they saw her one accessory but no one knows where it is. The following day Angelica saw Anne being surrounded with other kids at the park. She wandered why this is happening but when she came closer to them, she saw that Anne was showing them the necklace that she said she bought. After Angelica witnessed this, she immediately called Anne and they went to a place where nobody can see or hear them. Here she asked calmly why Anne stole hey necklace. Anne said she was jealous of the life Angelica has and is devastated by the money her family has. Angelica understood her situation. After being stolen from, she didn’t get mad. Instead, she offers Anne the necklace and said “we are all the same no matter what the amount of our money is. As long as you don’t steal from others again, we can still be friends.” Anne was joyous once she heard that from Angelica and she swore to never steal again. They continued to be friends without telling the others of the situation they were in. For the next years of their life, they had accompanied one another as adults and started helping other children in need who are in the same situation as Anne when they were kids. They lived a life filled with love and support.PA HELP PLEASE :) Exposition: Rising Action:​</h2><br />
