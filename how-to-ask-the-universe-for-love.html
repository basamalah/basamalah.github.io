You will also be asked to critically reflect upon the so-called universal questions like, 'who am I, really?" or "Why can't I stop myself fromasking questions? In this way you will hopefully see for yourself that there are nevereasy answers to seemingly simple questions. To this end you will be taught to performphenomenological reflections.What I Know1.

                                            Pandemic: A Message of HopeWe slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized thatParis is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyonesleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparentsbecame an act of love,Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not thatvaluable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one willever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties.Enjoy our life when we have one.The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve aroundis so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we arefinally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home andfamily that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent ourtime, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things wecherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were neverreally grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest ofreminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look withinourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunityto heal.Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thingthat it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through,learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us alltogether like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positiveor optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or bethe light in the darkness that everyone wants to see.If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a littlelonger, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that stillhas hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.Questions;1.Which parts of that motivational speech (sentences or paragraphs) you have given more emphasis when you delivered it?2.

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                                            princess olayra story gift. The queen told Celina that she would ask other things as a gift, but not Olayra. Celina did not insist. The queen thank her for giving a beautiful name to her baby.   One morning, Mengay with her baby Natalie in her arms, went for a stroll on beach. While she was walking, a very big wave rose and Mengay was so frightened when the wave struck her and because of the strong impact, Mengay lost hold of her baby and she was carried by the wave. Mengay grieved so much because she lost her baby girl. Natalie was fortunate because on the beach that was from Mengay’s home, a woman found Baby Natalie on the beach, wrapped in her diaper with her name on it. The woman was so glad because the baby was heaven-sent. She reared the child as her own.   In the kingdom under the Bubog tree, in Carit-an, the king and the queen were planning to send Olayra to the outer world. They want her to grow up with mortals or human beings so that when she is already a grown-up lady, she would marry a human being and have a possibility of bearing a child who would already have a soul. Their problem was how and to whom would they give Olayra. The king and queen knew about Mente’s whereabouts. They sent for him and inquired to whom would they give Olayra? One morning, before the sun was up, they brought Olayra to the outer world. They wrapped the baby in a diaper bearing the name “Olayra” and placed her under the tree near Mengay’s house. When Akoy and Mengay woke up, they heard a baby crying. They tried to find out where the baby’s cry came from. The y found the baby girl wrapped in a diaper with the name Olayra. Akoy and Mengay were happy to have a baby who took the place of Natalie. They reared the baby until she was of school age. Every now and then, the king and queen visit their child, but human beings couldn’t see them. They gave Olayra everything that she needs without the knowledge of her foster parents, often times; they took Olayra to their kingdom. When Olayra was of school age, she was sent to Patnongon to attend classes in the elementary grades. She went to school with Celina. In as much as Celina was a fairy, nobody could see her. When they were in college, Celina and Olayra were sent to Central Philippine University in Iloilo to take up college course. The king and queen gave Olayra a ship made of gold and this was the ship Olayra rides whenever she goes on a cruise to other kingdoms. Akoy and Mengay were not aware that their adopted daughter was a fairy.   Olayra grew up into a beautiful lady. Her foster parents love her very much. Many young men wanted to marry Olayra but she rejected all young men who fell in love with her.   Fitzgerald, a young man of an Italian parentage, was very fond of going to other places for an adventure. He has a very luxurious yacht that takes him on a cruise with some of his friends. One day, while he was having a cruise, a storm came and broke his yacht to pieces. All of them were thrown into the raging water. Most of his friends got drowned. Fitzgerald was the only survivor. Some residents living near the Bubog tree found him. A couple took him to their house and nursed him until he got well. He couldn’t go back to his homeland because his yacht was already destroyed. Means of transportation that time was very difficult.   One day, while he was waiting near the beach, he met Olayra. Other meetings followed their first meeting. Fitzgerald knew where Olayra resides and he became very fond of her until finally he fell in love with the young lady.   On the other hand, rumors spread that Natalie was the daughter of Mengay and Akoy who was found on the beach while still a baby she was known from the diaper that was wrapped around her. People kept on wondering. Of Natalie was Mengay’s daughter, then who is Olayra?   Because Olayra also liked Fitzgerald very much, they set a date for their wedding. Their wedding took place in Patnongon. After the wedding, Fitzgerald found out that Olayra was not the daughter of Akoy and Mengay. Fitzgerald asked Olayra repeatedly who were her parents but Olayra ignores his questions, until Fitzgerald became impatient. Because Olayra did not tell Fitzgerald who her parents were, Fitzgerald slapped her. When Olayra’s parents, the queen and the king learned about the incident, they became angry. They decided to get rid of Fitzgerald. One day, Fitzgerald could no longer be found. There was a long search for him but no one could tell where he was. Olayra knew what happened to Fitzgerald.   Finally, she made a revelation to her foster parents that she is a fairy and that her real parents wanted her to live with them in their kingdom. Mengay and Akoy knew that their daughter Natalie is alive so they took her from the people who adopted her.Question?what is the Outline, summarize, Paraphrase ​</a>

                                            Does evil exist?
The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists? A student bravely replied, “Yes, he did!”
“God created everything? The professor asked.
“Yes sir”, the student replied.
The professor answered, “If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil”. The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.
Another student raised his hand and said, “Can I ask you a question professor?”
“Of course”, replied the professor.
The student stood up and asked, “Professor, does cold exist?”
“What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never
been cold?” The students snickered at the young man’s question.
The young man replied, “In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat.”
The student continued, “Professor, does darkness exist?”
The professor responded, “Of course it does.”
The student replied, “Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton’s prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn’t this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present.”
Finally the young man asked the professor, “Sir, does evil exist?”
Now uncertain, the professor responded, “Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man’s inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.”
To this the student replied, “Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God’s love present in his heart. It’s like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.”
The professor sat down.

                                            A. William Henry Gates III (Bill) was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Bill was the second of three children in an upper-middle class family. He enjoyed playing games with the family and was very competitive. He also loved to read. Bill became bored in public school, so his family sent him to Lakeside School, a private school, where he excelled in math and science and did well in drama and English. Gates became interested in computer programming when he was 13, during the era of giant mainframe computers. His school held a fund-raiser to purchase a teletype terminal so students could use computer time that was donated by General Electric. Using this time, Gates wrote a tic-tac-toe program using BASIC, one of the first computer languages. Later he created a computer version of Risk, a board game he liked in which the goal is world domination. At Lakeside, Bill met Paul Allen, who shared his interest in computers. Gates and Allen and two other students hacked into a computer belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) to get free computer time but were caught. After a period of probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to fix glitches in CCC’s software. At age 17, Gates and Allen were paid $20,000 for a program called Traf-O-Data that was used to count traffic. In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT and was accepted by Harvard University. Steve Ballmer, who became CEO of Microsoft after Bill retired, was also a Harvard student. Meanwhile, Paul Allen dropped out of Washington College to work on computers at Honeywell Corporation and convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard and join him in starting a new software company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They called it Micro-Soft. This was soon changed to Microsoft, and they moved their company to Bellevue, Washington. In 1980, IBM, one of the largest technology companies of the era, asked Microsoft to write software to run their new personal computer, the IBM PC. Microsoft kept the licensing rights for the operating system (MS-DOS) so that they earned money for every computer sold first by IBM, and later by all the other companies that made PC computers. Microsoft grew quickly from 25 employees in 1978 to over 90,000 today. Over the years, Microsoft developed many new technologies and some of the world’s most popular software and products such as Word and PowerPoint. Although some have criticized Gates for using questionable business practices, he built Microsoft into one of the largest companies in the world. He has been described as brilliant but childlike, driven, competitive, intense, fun, but lacking in empathy. Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world. In 2012, his $61 billion in assets made him the world's second richest man according to Forbes Magazine. In 2006, Gates announced that he would cut back his involvement at Microsoft to spend more time on philanthropy and his foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports many causes including the quest to eradicate polio, fighting AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; providing vaccinations for children; and even reinventing the toilet, among many other things. 1.

                                            Pandemic: A Message of Hope We slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized that Paris is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyone sleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparents became an act of love, Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not that valuable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one will ever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties. Enjoy our life when we have one. The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve around is so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we are finally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home and family that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent our time, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things we cherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were never really grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest of reminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look within ourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunity to heal. Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thing that it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through, learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us all together like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positive or optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or be the light in the darkness that everyone wants to see. If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a little longer, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that still has hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.

                            4. Pandemic: A Message of HopeWe slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized thatParis is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyonesleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparentsbecame an act of love,Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not thatvaluable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one willever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties.Enjoy our life when we have one.The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve aroundis so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we arefinally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home andfamily that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent ourtime, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things wecherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were neverreally grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest ofreminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look withinourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunityto heal.Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thingthat it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through,learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us alltogether like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positiveor optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or bethe light in the darkness that everyone wants to see.If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a littlelonger, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that stillhas hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.Questions;1.Which parts of that motivational speech (sentences or paragraphs) you have given more emphasis when you delivered it?2.

                            7. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                            8. princess olayra story gift. The queen told Celina that she would ask other things as a gift, but not Olayra. Celina did not insist. The queen thank her for giving a beautiful name to her baby.   One morning, Mengay with her baby Natalie in her arms, went for a stroll on beach. While she was walking, a very big wave rose and Mengay was so frightened when the wave struck her and because of the strong impact, Mengay lost hold of her baby and she was carried by the wave. Mengay grieved so much because she lost her baby girl. Natalie was fortunate because on the beach that was from Mengay’s home, a woman found Baby Natalie on the beach, wrapped in her diaper with her name on it. The woman was so glad because the baby was heaven-sent. She reared the child as her own.   In the kingdom under the Bubog tree, in Carit-an, the king and the queen were planning to send Olayra to the outer world. They want her to grow up with mortals or human beings so that when she is already a grown-up lady, she would marry a human being and have a possibility of bearing a child who would already have a soul. Their problem was how and to whom would they give Olayra. The king and queen knew about Mente’s whereabouts. They sent for him and inquired to whom would they give Olayra? One morning, before the sun was up, they brought Olayra to the outer world. They wrapped the baby in a diaper bearing the name “Olayra” and placed her under the tree near Mengay’s house. When Akoy and Mengay woke up, they heard a baby crying. They tried to find out where the baby’s cry came from. The y found the baby girl wrapped in a diaper with the name Olayra. Akoy and Mengay were happy to have a baby who took the place of Natalie. They reared the baby until she was of school age. Every now and then, the king and queen visit their child, but human beings couldn’t see them. They gave Olayra everything that she needs without the knowledge of her foster parents, often times; they took Olayra to their kingdom. When Olayra was of school age, she was sent to Patnongon to attend classes in the elementary grades. She went to school with Celina. In as much as Celina was a fairy, nobody could see her. When they were in college, Celina and Olayra were sent to Central Philippine University in Iloilo to take up college course. The king and queen gave Olayra a ship made of gold and this was the ship Olayra rides whenever she goes on a cruise to other kingdoms. Akoy and Mengay were not aware that their adopted daughter was a fairy.   Olayra grew up into a beautiful lady. Her foster parents love her very much. Many young men wanted to marry Olayra but she rejected all young men who fell in love with her.   Fitzgerald, a young man of an Italian parentage, was very fond of going to other places for an adventure. He has a very luxurious yacht that takes him on a cruise with some of his friends. One day, while he was having a cruise, a storm came and broke his yacht to pieces. All of them were thrown into the raging water. Most of his friends got drowned. Fitzgerald was the only survivor. Some residents living near the Bubog tree found him. A couple took him to their house and nursed him until he got well. He couldn’t go back to his homeland because his yacht was already destroyed. Means of transportation that time was very difficult.   One day, while he was waiting near the beach, he met Olayra. Other meetings followed their first meeting. Fitzgerald knew where Olayra resides and he became very fond of her until finally he fell in love with the young lady.   On the other hand, rumors spread that Natalie was the daughter of Mengay and Akoy who was found on the beach while still a baby she was known from the diaper that was wrapped around her. People kept on wondering. Of Natalie was Mengay’s daughter, then who is Olayra?   Because Olayra also liked Fitzgerald very much, they set a date for their wedding. Their wedding took place in Patnongon. After the wedding, Fitzgerald found out that Olayra was not the daughter of Akoy and Mengay. Fitzgerald asked Olayra repeatedly who were her parents but Olayra ignores his questions, until Fitzgerald became impatient. Because Olayra did not tell Fitzgerald who her parents were, Fitzgerald slapped her. When Olayra’s parents, the queen and the king learned about the incident, they became angry. They decided to get rid of Fitzgerald. One day, Fitzgerald could no longer be found. There was a long search for him but no one could tell where he was. Olayra knew what happened to Fitzgerald.   Finally, she made a revelation to her foster parents that she is a fairy and that her real parents wanted her to live with them in their kingdom. Mengay and Akoy knew that their daughter Natalie is alive so they took her from the people who adopted her.Question?what is the Outline, summarize, Paraphrase ​</h2><br />

                            10. Does evil exist?
The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists? A student bravely replied, “Yes, he did!”
“God created everything? The professor asked.
“Yes sir”, the student replied.
The professor answered, “If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil”. The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.
Another student raised his hand and said, “Can I ask you a question professor?”
“Of course”, replied the professor.
The student stood up and asked, “Professor, does cold exist?”
“What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never
been cold?” The students snickered at the young man’s question.
The young man replied, “In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat.”
The student continued, “Professor, does darkness exist?”
The professor responded, “Of course it does.”
The student replied, “Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton’s prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn’t this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present.”
Finally the young man asked the professor, “Sir, does evil exist?”
Now uncertain, the professor responded, “Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man’s inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.”
To this the student replied, “Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God’s love present in his heart. It’s like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.”
The professor sat down.
The young man’s name — Albert Einstein.</h2><br />

                            11. A. William Henry Gates III (Bill) was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Bill was the second of three children in an upper-middle class family. He enjoyed playing games with the family and was very competitive. He also loved to read. Bill became bored in public school, so his family sent him to Lakeside School, a private school, where he excelled in math and science and did well in drama and English. Gates became interested in computer programming when he was 13, during the era of giant mainframe computers. His school held a fund-raiser to purchase a teletype terminal so students could use computer time that was donated by General Electric. Using this time, Gates wrote a tic-tac-toe program using BASIC, one of the first computer languages. Later he created a computer version of Risk, a board game he liked in which the goal is world domination. At Lakeside, Bill met Paul Allen, who shared his interest in computers. Gates and Allen and two other students hacked into a computer belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) to get free computer time but were caught. After a period of probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to fix glitches in CCC’s software. At age 17, Gates and Allen were paid $20,000 for a program called Traf-O-Data that was used to count traffic. In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT and was accepted by Harvard University. Steve Ballmer, who became CEO of Microsoft after Bill retired, was also a Harvard student. Meanwhile, Paul Allen dropped out of Washington College to work on computers at Honeywell Corporation and convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard and join him in starting a new software company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They called it Micro-Soft. This was soon changed to Microsoft, and they moved their company to Bellevue, Washington. In 1980, IBM, one of the largest technology companies of the era, asked Microsoft to write software to run their new personal computer, the IBM PC. Microsoft kept the licensing rights for the operating system (MS-DOS) so that they earned money for every computer sold first by IBM, and later by all the other companies that made PC computers. Microsoft grew quickly from 25 employees in 1978 to over 90,000 today. Over the years, Microsoft developed many new technologies and some of the world’s most popular software and products such as Word and PowerPoint. Although some have criticized Gates for using questionable business practices, he built Microsoft into one of the largest companies in the world. He has been described as brilliant but childlike, driven, competitive, intense, fun, but lacking in empathy. Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world. In 2012, his $61 billion in assets made him the world's second richest man according to Forbes Magazine. In 2006, Gates announced that he would cut back his involvement at Microsoft to spend more time on philanthropy and his foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports many causes including the quest to eradicate polio, fighting AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis; providing vaccinations for children; and even reinventing the toilet, among many other things. 1.

                            13. Pandemic: A Message of Hope We slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized that Paris is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyone sleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparents became an act of love, Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not that valuable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one will ever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties. Enjoy our life when we have one. The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve around is so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we are finally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home and family that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent our time, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things we cherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were never really grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest of reminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look within ourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunity to heal. Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thing that it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through, learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us all together like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positive or optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or be the light in the darkness that everyone wants to see. If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a little longer, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that still has hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.
