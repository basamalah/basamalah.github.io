                                            WEEK N bio Assessment I. 1-5. Read the sample comparison-and-contrast paragraph below. Identify the transitional words or phrases used to develop ideas. Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I did not leave my homeland, the Philippines. The Philippines has a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514,000 square kilometers. This shows that Filipinos are 100 million in number, and most of them practice Catholicism. Thais, on the other hand, are now 67 million, and most of them are Buddhists. The Philippines has a unitary presidential constitutional form of government, whereas Thailand has a constitutional monarchy administered by a military junta. Despite these few differences, both countries share almost the same tropical climate ranging from rainy to dry and warm, and humid to cool in some inclusive months. Thais and Filipinos are alike in physical features and both speak English as the second language. Just like the Philippines, Thailand also faces environmental issues such as air pollution from vehicular emissions, water pollution from organic and factory wastes, soil erosion, and wildlife population threats. These are only a few of the similarities and differences between the two countries. There are still a lot more things about them to learn and discover. ED​</a>

Among the Asian nations, I find the Philippines and Thailand so interestingly comparable in many aspects that when I visit Thailand, I feel like I did not leave my homeland, the Philippines. The Philippines has a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers while Thailand has 514,000 square kilometers. This shows that Filipinos are 100 million in number, and most of them practice Catholicism. Thais, on the other hand, are now 67 million, and most of them are Buddhists. The Philippines has a unitary presidential constitutional form of government, whereas Thailand has a constitutional monarchy administered by a military junta. Despite these few differences, both countries share almost the same tropical climate ranging from rainy to dry and warm, and humid to cool in some inclusive months. Thais and Filipinos are alike in physical features and both speak English as the second language. Just like the Philippines, Thailand also faces environmental issues such as air pollution from vehicular emissions, water pollution from organic and factory wastes, soil erosion, and wildlife population threats. These are only a few of the similarities and differences between the two countries. There are still a lot more things about them to learn and discover. ED​</h2><br />
