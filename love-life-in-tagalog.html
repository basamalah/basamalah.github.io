                                            CONFLICT THEORY
This sociological perspective is the opposite of the latter. Karl Marx viewed social stratification as creation of inequality between the rich and the poor, or the powerful versus the powerless. Let's say for example: The bourgeois capitalists owning high-producing businesses or factories and hire people who work for them. They can enjoy the luxury of life because they earn billions of money. However, proletariats are the working class earned skimpy wages and experiencing isolation to the society. The very essence of life is to enjoy it with loved ones. However, 'working class did not experience this joy because they are isolated to do the labor for long hours each day to earn money at the end of the month. Marx argued that proletariats were oppressed by the money-hungry bourgeois.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

                                            Tagalog meaning of Friendships are ties formed by two or more people who want to interact with one other. It entails taking an interest in one another's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Friendships are built on trust, respect, emotional support, and admiration. Life's too short to waste your days with someone who make you feel unworthy and unappreciated. Spend it with friends who makes you laugh and feel loved.
I hope you understand how much having you in my life means to me. You have made my problems lighter and my life better. You've been there when the weather was good and stood with me in the rain, you've laughed with me in the good times and the bad, and you've even shared my sorrow. I adore everything about you because you're more than just a friend to me; you're also my best friend and a bro.</a>

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</a>

                            8. CONFLICT THEORY
This sociological perspective is the opposite of the latter. Karl Marx viewed social stratification as creation of inequality between the rich and the poor, or the powerful versus the powerless. Let's say for example: The bourgeois capitalists owning high-producing businesses or factories and hire people who work for them. They can enjoy the luxury of life because they earn billions of money. However, proletariats are the working class earned skimpy wages and experiencing isolation to the society. The very essence of life is to enjoy it with loved ones. However, 'working class did not experience this joy because they are isolated to do the labor for long hours each day to earn money at the end of the month. Marx argued that proletariats were oppressed by the money-hungry bourgeois.

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

It entails taking an interest in one another's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Friendships are built on trust, respect, emotional support, and admiration. Life's too short to waste your days with someone who make you feel unworthy and unappreciated. Spend it with friends who makes you laugh and feel loved.
I hope you understand how much having you in my life means to me. You have made my problems lighter and my life better. You've been there when the weather was good and stood with me in the rain, you've laughed with me in the good times and the bad, and you've even shared my sorrow.

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</h2><br />
