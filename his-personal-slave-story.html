                                            The Lion and the Poor Slave
There was once a slave who was treated cruelly by his master. One day, he couldn't take it anymore and ran away to the forest to escape. There he chanced upon a lion who couldn't walk because of the thorn in its paw. Although he's scared, the slave mustered his courage and took out the thorn in the lion's paw. When the lion was finally free of the thorn, he ran into the forest and didn't harm the slave. Sometime later, the slave was caught by his master along with some animals in the forest. The master then ordered the slave to be thrown into the lion's den. When the slave saw the lion, he recognized it as the same lion he helped in the forest. The slave was able to escape the den unharmed and he freed all the other animals.

                            9. The Lion and the Poor Slave
There was once a slave who was treated cruelly by his master. One day, he couldn't take it anymore and ran away to the forest to escape. There he chanced upon a lion who couldn't walk because of the thorn in its paw. Although he's scared, the slave mustered his courage and took out the thorn in the lion's paw. When the lion was finally free of the thorn, he ran into the forest and didn't harm the slave. Sometime later, the slave was caught by his master along with some animals in the forest. The master then ordered the slave to be thrown into the lion's den. When the slave saw the lion, he recognized it as the same lion he helped in the forest. The slave was able to escape the den unharmed and he freed all the other animals.

                            11. Expound the statement below based on your own interpretation Socrates- “The immoral person literally becomes a slave of his desire.”​</h2><br />
                        Answer<p>To understand this statement of the philosopher Socrates we must first learn the keywords:</p>Immoralnot adhering to accepted standards of morality. <strong>Iniquity </strong>is synonymous with this. It means immoral or grossly unfair behavior.  Desirea strong feeling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen.<p>Hence, in the shortest explanation, the quote means is that a person of low morality cannot control his desire. This is dangerous as it could lead to addiction. Meaning, physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance, and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects.</p><p>In Scripture, this is called <strong>"Slavery to Sin." </strong>It is being a slave to Satan and his deceptions in this world. Freedom from slavery (to sin) is one of God's gifts to those who TRULY have faith and remains in Jesus Christ. "Slavery to Sin" is written throughout the New Testament.</p>For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For the desire to do what is good is with me, but there is no ability to do it.  <strong>Romans 7:18</strong>Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death.  <strong>James 1:15</strong>Jesus responded, “Truly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.  <strong>John 8:34</strong><p></p><p><strong>Why is the Bible Unique? -</strong>  https://brainly.ph/question/2903514</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

                            25. When Pharaoh changed his mind and sent his army after the slaves, where did they meet at?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The Egyptians were horrified at the deaths of their sons and urged the Israelites to leave hastily before any more people died. Here, Pharaoh is standing on the battlements, commanding the Israelites to leave Egypt. The Israelites are leaving with their right hands raised and some are carrying lumps of dough. Moses had reminded his people that they had to leave in a hurry, and that their bread dough would not have time to rise. They were therefore told to make 'unleavened' bread (bread made without yeast) To commemorate this, unleavened bread is eaten by Jewish people during the Passover festival.</p><p></p><p><strong>As the Israelites had left, Pharaoh changed his mind. He called his army and set off to pursue the Israelites on chariots. The Israelites in great fear, cried to Moses 'it would have been better for us to stay than to die in the wilderness'. But Moses told them that God would help them. God ordered Moses to stretch out his staff over the Red Sea, and the sea parted. This allowed the Israelites to escape across the sea,  and away from Egypt unharmed. Meanwhile, the Pharaoh and his army followed them by charging into the sea. But Moses waved his staff, and the sea returned to its normal height, swallowing up the entire army of Pharaoh.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The story of the escape from Egypt is commemorated by Jewish people every year during the festival of Passover. In this way the idea of freedom is kept alive, and is continually passed on by families to their children.</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The Red Sea<p>Pharaoh changed his mind about releasing the Israelites slaves, so he sent his army to go after them and capture them. They met at the <strong>Red Sea</strong>, where Moses opened a pathway in the middle of the sea. The Israelites were able to pass safely, but the Pharaoh army was not so lucky. The sea closed upon them and drowned them. </p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning<p></p><br />

pa answerrr po t.t</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Sometimes your desire can be bad. Once you desire something you will do anything to achieve it. And it can be addictive. Once you desire something and you are an immoral person, you will do everything and anything to achieve your desire even if it cost you to do something bad. You will not be able to control yourself anymore at that point because all you wanna do is to achieve it. You don't care about the laws anymore and you will not be able to think right. You can do different kinds of stuff. Such as Killing, stealing, and all kinds of acts. You can also be a drug addict, thief, murderer, and many more. By chasing your desire, you can turn into a person others might not like. Desire can be dangerous, especially to an immoral person. For example, you desire to have that person in your life. You will think of any kind of possibly way to have that person. You might even kill to get that person. You might kidnap that person to get her/him. If you're an immoral person and you desire something. You will not be in charge of your action. Your desire is.

                            30. what will happen if two persons married, of whom one was a maharlica and the other is slave​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>If the maharlicas are to be married to a slave or to have children, then the child with the odd number position will belong to the father while the even number positioned child will belong to the mother. Therefore if the father is free, then its child was also free but if he's a slave then his child is also considered a slave. Maharlicas are said to stay in their respective villages after marriage unless they paid a fine for them to leave the village. Before marriages occur, a dowry is first given to the family of the girl from the boy's family. This dowry is a gift to the parents of the girl.</p><p></p><p>I have read many of these and this common knowledge might be useful.</p><p></p><br />
