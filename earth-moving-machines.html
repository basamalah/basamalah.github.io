Block and tackle is made up of a frame, several pulleys, and the rope.D. Fixed pulley has a fulcrum, a pivot point around which a lever turns.29. Levers are the most common simple machines which help man to perform heavy tasks easily. It is classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd class. Which of the following explain 1st class levers?A. Its fulcrum is between the effort and the load or resistance. B. It converts a downward moving force into a lifting force.C. Its load moves at a shorter distance. D. It is observable in a wheelbarrow. 30. Levers are varied, but all have a few components. How do you describe 2nd class levers? Second class levers always have the load closer to the fulcrum than the effort, sothey will always allow a smaller effort to move a larger load, giving a mechanical advantage greater than oneA.
