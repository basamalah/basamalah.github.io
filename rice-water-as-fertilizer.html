Basal application is the application of fertilizer before or during planting. 8. A simple way of measuring 6g to 10g of fertilizer is by using a full but leveled bottle water or soda cap. 9. Human inhabitation wastes includes rice straw, corn stalks, weeds, stubbles, plant leaves. 10. In - Organic fertilizers are farm manures, compost, crop residues, and other farm wastes, which supply nutrients and improve soil physical conditions.Nonsense Answers Report!!​</a>

(ASAP please)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>
In a hypothesis test, sample data is evaluated in order to arrive at a decision about some type of claim. If certain conditions about the sample are satisfied, then the claim can be evaluated for a population. In a hypothesis test, we: Evaluate the null hypothesis, typically denoted with H0. The null is not rejected unless the hypothesis test shows otherwise. The null statement must always contain some form of equality (=, ≤ or ≥) Always write the alternative hypothesis, typically denoted with Ha or H1, using less than, greater than, or not equals symbols, i.e., (≠, &gt;, or &lt;). If we reject the null hypothesis, then we can assume there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. Never state that a claim is proven true or false. Keep in mind the underlying fact that hypothesis testing is based on probability laws; therefore, we can talk only in terms of non-absolute certainties.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>
