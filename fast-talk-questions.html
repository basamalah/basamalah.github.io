                                            CASE ANALYSIS: The Busy BossJohn Gill is a busy man. No matter how fast he works, it seems that he's always left behind. Consequently,when an employee brings Gill a problem, he is not a good listener. He would open his mail or answer thetelephone, and would constantly glance at his watch while the employee is talking. In addition, he makesoutright judgment and would always dive into conclusion on any given situation. As a result, John keepsbeing blindsided by new problems in the organization that seem to get more and more serious.Question:1. Describe the inhibitor/s to communication demonstrated on the above scenario.​</a>

Consequently,when an employee brings Gill a problem, he is not a good listener. He would open his mail or answer thetelephone, and would constantly glance at his watch while the employee is talking. In addition, he makesoutright judgment and would always dive into conclusion on any given situation. As a result, John keepsbeing blindsided by new problems in the organization that seem to get more and more serious.Question:1.
