                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) Attention to detail: A good questioned document examiner must pay close attention to even the smallest detail and ensure they are accurately recorded and analyzed. For example, they may notice a slight variation in handwriting or the presence of an erasure that could provide valuable evidence in a case.</p><p></p><p>2) Objectivity: A good questioned document expert must remain impartial and objective throughout the examination process. This means that they do not allow any personal biases or preconceptions to influence their analysis of the evidence.</p><p></p><p>3) Knowledge of forensic techniques: A good questioned document examiner should have a strong knowledge of forensic techniques and the latest technologies used in document analysis. This includes understanding of fingerprinting, ink analysis, and photo comparison, among others.</p><p></p><p>4) Communication skills: A good questioned document examiner should have excellent communication skills and be able to present their findings in a clear and concise manner, both in written reports and in court testimony.</p><p></p><p>5) Critical thinking: A good questioned document expert should have strong critical thinking skills to analyze and interpret complex evidence and draw valid conclusions. They should be able to use their knowledge of handwriting, typography, and other relevant factors to identify any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the documents.</p><p></p><p>Example: A questioned document examiner might be called upon to analyze a series of signatures on a check. He or she would need to pay close attention to the size, shape, and consistency of the signatures, as well as the ink used and any other identifying features. From there, the examiner may use forensic techniques such as handwriting analysis to identify any irregularities or suspicious behaviors, such as tracing or forgery. The examiner would then present their findings in a clear and concise report and potentially provide testimony in court to support their conclusions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>My hands are sore but this is the least I could do to help! ^^</p><br />
