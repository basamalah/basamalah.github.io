                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying can affect everyone those who are bullied, those who bully, and those who witness bullying. Bullying is linked to many negative outcomes including impacts on mental health, substance use, and suicide. It is important to talk to kids to determine whether bullying or something else is a concern. Kids who are bullied can experience negative physical, social, emotional, academic, and mental health issues.

                        <p>A lot of children and teenagers become a victim of bullying in daily life. Bullying affects people beyond their imagination. While some children face the situation bravely and fight back; others just crush down into solitary and introvert individuals.
</p><p>
</p><p>Often, the victims of bullying are compelled to take dangerous steps. These kids suffer from issues while they grow up. The impact of bullying remains with them throughout life. In this article, we will see how school bullying impacts the life of a child. School bullying has become very common nowadays. It leads to severe repercussions. </p><p></p>Anxiety and depression
<p>
</p><p>Children who have bullied face depression on several different levels based on the severity of bullying. A majority of children do not speak about it at home. Parents are required to keep a track on the behavior and interaction of the child to find out any signs of the problem.
</p><p>
</p><p>Children who get bullied don’t feel comfortable discussing it. They like to keep it to themselves. This increases depression and anxiety in them that leads to serious issues. It hampers the personality development of the child. He becomes timid and prefers to stay in his shell. The parent must become friends with their children so that they do not hesitate to share their problems.

<p>
</p><p>That feeling of insult disturbs the student. Those thoughts keep getting replayed in their mind. This deprives them to sleep or eat properly. Many times, those traumatic memories leave them restless and scared.
</p><p>
</p>Lack of interest in studies
<p>
</p><p>Children who are bullied at school can’t fall asleep due to fear that they will have to face the same humiliation the next day. They lose the interest of going to school and that negatively impacts their studies and academic performance.
</p><p>
</p>A feeling of loneliness and sadness
<p>
</p><p>A common impact of bullying is the sadness and loneliness that fills up their mind. Kids who are bullied at school spend less time with siblings and parents. As they go through a lot of stress and disappointment, they are also refrained from mixing with their classmates. The fear of getting bullied makes them recluse.

                        <p><strong>Answer: If you’re being bullied there’s a lot you can do. While different tactics work for different people, the first thing you should do is try to work it out yourself.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Depending on how bad the bullying is (and as long as you don’t feel at risk, scared or physically threatened) you might want to try and work it out yourself – as a first step.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The more empowered you are, and the more you can help yourself, the better chance you have to stop the bully.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>If the bully doesn’t change their behavior, that’s when talking to someone else can be really helpful.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The bully wants you to react. Their goal is to take away your power, make you sad and scared. And if you show them you are not sad and scared, they will often lose interest and they cannot take away your power.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Remember they want to upset you constantly so you get angry. If you don’t get angry, the bully will lose their own power.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Remember that bullies are human - they eat, sleep and live just like you do.

                        <strong></strong>Most people know that bullying is wrong. Calling someone names has absolutely no beneficial purpose. Moreover, hitting someone makes a bully feel good in the moment while doing permanent damage to the person being victimized. With the Internet, people now have even more opportunities to bully through cyberbullying. This includes sending crude pictures, posting fake web pages, or tweeting slanderous messages. Cyberbullying has subsequently led to a rise in a completely new kind of bullying.<p>One of the effects of bullying is that it can change the victim’s personality. It can cause people who are normally confident and happy to become self-conscious, shy, and unsure. Additionally, victims of bullying may also become sad or depressed. Their confidence might completely disappear, keeping them from trying new things or trusting people. Once a person has been bullied, they may hesitate to participate in situations where he or she might be ridiculed, such as in public speaking or in sports. A bullying victim might even begin to possess previously absent anxious<br />behavior.</p><p>Despite all the negative effects of bullying, there are even far more serious consequences. People who have been bullied sometimes become so upset, scared, or depressed that they see no worth in themselves and no way out of their torment. There have been countless reports over the past few years of students committing suicide because they were bullied. Meanwhile, there are times when victims see no recourse but to seek revenge by serious acts of violence against the bully and instigators. As a result of bullying, people can lose their ability to love and trust, denying them the chance to experience a quality relationship later in their life. They might find themselves as a submissive partner or they may want to be completely alone. Compounding all of these problems, victims often develop eating disorders, begin to self-injure, or require extensive counseling. Social bullying can also leave people without a supportive group of friends that they can lean on and spend time with.</p><p>Another unfortunate consequence of this is that bullying is often cyclical. People who have been bullied can, in an attempt to gain their power and self-esteem back, become bullies themselves. In relation to this, bullies who are not confronted or stopped may find themselves in future positions where they can bully as adults. This is where manipulative bosses and child abusers come from.</p><p>Aside from its long-term effects, some consequences of bullying can be seen and felt immediately. When one child calls another child names, the victim might cry and a bruise might appear after a punch to the arm. However, some effects of bullying are not always obvious to the naked eye. The results of bullying might grow and appear over time, damaging a person in profound ways for the long term. There are so many effects of bullying that they are impossible to count or predict. This is why it is so important to stop bullying.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bullying is a pervasive issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds. It can take many forms, including physical, verbal, and psychological abuse. While the specific reasons why people become bullies can vary depending on individual circumstances, there are several common causes that contribute to this behavior.</p><p></p><p>One of the primary causes of bullying is a lack of empathy. Some people are simply unable to understand or relate to the feelings of others, which can lead them to act aggressively and without regard for the harm they may cause. This lack of empathy may stem from a variety of factors, such as a difficult upbringing, a lack of social support, or a mental health condition like antisocial personality disorder.</p><p></p><p>Another factor that can contribute to bullying is a desire for power and control. Some bullies may feel powerless in other aspects of their lives, such as in their relationships or in their academic or professional pursuits. To compensate for this, they may seek to exert power and control over others through bullying behavior. This can be particularly true in environments where there is a culture of competitiveness or where success is measured by one's ability to dominate or intimidate others</p><br />
