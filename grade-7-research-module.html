                                            1. A review of 46 studies of motorcycle helmets and helmet laws reported that every study comparing helmeted and non helmeted crash victims found that helmet riders had lower fatality rates, ranging from 28 percent to 7 percent lower Claim of Policy: The government should impone stricter rules for motorcycle riders 2. Research has found that the key to a healthy lifestyle is 30-40 minutes of exercise a day. Whether it is working out in a gym, brisk walking, jogging, swimming, riding a bike, or playing a sport, any kind of physical activity releases chemicals called endorphins which trigger a positive feeling in the body. Claim of Fact: 3. As coronavirus cases rise, DOH reiterates: Stay home, follow health protocols Claim of Policy: 4. Republic Act 11469 was signed into law on 23 March 2020 (also known by its short title as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act) declaring a national health emergency throughout the Philippines as a result of the COVID-19 situation. In it, Congress authorizes the President to exercise the necessary special powers, for a limited time and subject to certain restrictions, to address a problem that poses a clear and present danger to the people, Claim of Value: 5. Latest data from DepEd showed that 3,885,427 learners prefer "modular" wherein modules - either printed or digital - will be used as an alternative learning option. Claim of Fact: 6. The first half of the decade's final year saw disaster, death, and disease. It was a period of seemingly organized sequential events that brought tears, despair, and chaos in the lives of many Filipinos. It was like a monthly episode of calamity: a volcanic explosion in January, an animal virus outbreak in February, and a pandemic in March. Claim of Fact: 7. Parent involvement in education is crucial. No matter their income or background, students with involved parents are more likely to have higher grades and test scores, attend school regularly, have better social skills, show improved behavior and adapt well to school.
