As a young and responsiblelearner, what health precautions and healthy lifestyle should you practice in order to keep your heart healthy andaway from diseases?plsss help me po, pasagot ASAP, thru essay po, tnx po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>To keep our heart healthy we should eat the foods that have the nutrients for our heart, we should also exercise to keep our heart pumping. Though don't overdo all of these just make sure you ate the right amount of food needed and got the right amount of exercise you did in a day. Also don't forget to rest always find time to rest.</p><p>Without question, the most important positive action you can take to prevent illness and disease is exercise. Exercise prevents a long list of diseases that can cause chronic or severe illness, disability, and even death, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, vascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis. Exercise also prevents mental health illness and disease disorders, including depression, anxiety, and stress. While some of these disease processes can be reversed with exercise and healthy life-style, some cannot. Preventing them from starting is the number one goal. Secondly, do not smoke. The most negative lifestyle behavior is smoking. Smoking contributes to the development of almost all diseases, notably cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and asthma. Smoking has the following negative health effects: lowers immunity and affects almost all of our body systems. The health benefits and risks of foods has been and will always be a source of excitement, controversy, and research. Although it might seem that dietary recommendations change frequently, the consistent findings are that getting adequate sources of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants through foods are the best way to stay healthy. Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and moderate in everything else, has been consistently found to be most beneficial. In most cases, people can, in fact, live longer, healthier lives by adjusting their diets, increasing their exercise levels, and changing various other detrimental aspects of their lifestyles. Furthermore, simultaneously possessing multiple healthy lifestyle characteristics provides additional benefits towards improving one’s health.</p><p></p><br />
