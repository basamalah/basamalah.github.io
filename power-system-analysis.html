                                            12. Crucial in the analysis of political party dynamics is the identification of a party system that exists in every State. A traditional way of classifying party system is on the basis of the number of parties vying for power (Duverger, 1954) - one-party, two-party, and multiparty system. In a one-party system, a single party is regarded as a vanguard that controls the power to the extent that its machinery has become fused with the State. The existence of other parties may be allowed so long as they remain compliant with the dominant party.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The term ” politics ” is generally applied to behavior within civil governments, but politics has been observed in all human group interactions. It consists of social relations involving authority or power, the regulation of political units, and the methods used to formulate and apply social policy.</p><p>Traditionally there have been four main areas of research: the socio-political formation of the modern state; how social inequality influences politics; how social movements outside of the formal institutions affect formal politics; and power relationships within and between social groups.</p><p>There are three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory, and class analysis.</p><p>Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. It holds the view that politics and decision making are located mostly in the framework of government, but many non-governmental groups use their resources to exert influence.</p><p>Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It posits that a small minority—consisting of members of the economic elite and policy-planning networks—holds the most power and that this power is independent of a state’s democratic elections process.</p><p>Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites.</p><br />

In a one-party system, a single party is regarded as a vanguard that controls the power to the extent that its machinery has become fused with the State.
