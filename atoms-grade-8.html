Scientists never stop investigating things. The history of the study of the atomic nature of matter illustrates
the thinking process that goes on in the philosophers' and scientists' heads. Some early Greek philosophers have
played pivotal roles concerning the atomic structure.
Objectives: To construct a timeline of the development of atom
Materials: copy of PT3, books, journals, (research from internet: optional)
Procedure:
1. Research the different scientists/philosophers that contribute in the development of an atom. You can use books,
journal, or you may research from internet (optional) to gather data.
2. Write the date of the discovery, name of the scientists/philosophers and their discoveries in the development of
the atom.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dalton's Atomic Model: This model was proposed by John Dalton in the early 1800s. It suggested that atoms were solid, indivisible particles with no internal structure.</p><p></p><p>Thomson's Atomic Model: This model was proposed by J.J. Thomson in 1897. It suggested that atoms were composed of smaller subatomic particles, specifically negatively charged electrons embedded in a positively charged sphere.</p><p></p><p>Rutherford's Atomic Model: This model was proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1911. It suggested that atoms have a central, positively charged nucleus, around which negatively charged electrons orbit.</p><p></p><p>Bohr's Atomic Model: This model was proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. It suggested that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, quantized energy levels, with the energy of each level corresponding to a specific distance from the nucleus.</p><p></p><p>Quantum Mechanical Atomic Model: This model, also known as the wave-mechanical model or the electron cloud model, was developed in the 1920s and 1930s. It suggests that electrons do not orbit the nucleus in a classical sense, but rather exist as a probability distribution, or electron cloud, around the nucleus. This model is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.</p><br />

Scientists never stop investigating things. The history of the study of the atomic nature of matter illustrates
the thinking process that goes on in the philosophers' and scientists' heads. Some early Greek philosophers have
played pivotal roles concerning the atomic structure.
Objectives: To construct a timeline of the development of atom
Materials: copy of PT3, books, journals, (research from internet: optional)
Procedure:
1. Research the different scientists/philosophers that contribute in the development of an atom. You can use books,
journal, or you may research from internet (optional) to gather data.
2. Write the date of the discovery, name of the scientists/philosophers and their discoveries in the development of
the atom.

How does the discovery of the atom important to human, animals, plants, and
environment?
Pls help</h2><br />
                        <p>The discovery of the atom is crucial to our understanding of the world around us and has led to numerous technological advancements. The study of atoms helps us understand the properties of matter, including its behavior, reactivity, and physical properties. This knowledge has important applications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, energy, and environmental science.</p><p></p><p>For example, our understanding of atomic structure has allowed us to develop technologies such as nuclear power and medical imaging, which have revolutionized energy production and medical diagnosis. The study of atoms and their behavior also plays a crucial role in agriculture, as scientists use this knowledge to develop better fertilizers, pesticides, and crop varieties.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, understanding the behavior of atoms is crucial in environmental science, as it allows us to track the movement of pollutants in the environment and develop strategies to minimize their impact. This knowledge also helps us better understand climate change and its potential effects on our planet.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the discovery of the atom has led to numerous technological advancements and has applications in a wide range of fields, including medicine, agriculture, energy, and environmental science.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
