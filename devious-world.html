WHAT MAKES  SUCCESSFUL LEADER?
You are a member of the Senate in Ancient Rome,
Soon you must decide whether to support or oppose a
powerful leader who wants to become a leader. Many
consider him a military genius for having gained a vast
territory and wealth for Rome. Others point out that he
disobeyed orders and is both ruthless and devious. You
wonder whether his ambition would lead to greater
prosperity and order in the empire or to injustice and
unrest
