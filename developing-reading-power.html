                                            All children have a set of genetic instructions that influence their characteristics at birth and emerging physical features as the grow.” Some characteristics awaken during sensitive periods which are age ranges in which environmental experiences are necessary for the child’s development. Other characteristics are controlled by genetics, this is known as canalization. Skills that are canalized include motor skills such as crawling and sitting. Skills that are not canalized are those that children are taught in school such as reading and writing. The environment continues to play a huge role in the genetic expression at different times throughout development. Nature and nurture are powerful and they are concepts that not only teachers, but also parents need to be aware of, being the adults in a child’s life. Genetic predispositions may be altered by environmental factors such as schooling, social interactions, and physical experiences.
Q2: How vital are environmental factors in the total development of a child?</a>

Man's Desire to Fly Before man's dream of being able to fly like birds, is as old as mankind. First, man tried to fly with wings like birds but all his attempts failed. Then he built balloons which were partially successful. In the twentieth century, man realized this dream when two Americans, Orville and Wilbur Wright finally built the first airplane. From then on, airplane have undergone so many changes and improvements and man today can even fly faster than a bird. Developing Reading Power 5​</a>

The capacity to read orally with speed, accuracy, and vocal expression is vital to a learner. The power to read fluently is one of several critical factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, it may be difficult for him to remember what he had read, and he may not be able to relate the ideas expressed in the text to his background knowledge. This accuracy and automaticity of reading serve as a bridge between decoding and comprehension. arasww.reading orkers are article/developing fluent readers Guide Questions: 1.

The Philippines is one of the best examples of countries that utilize geothermal energy. In fact, the Philippines ranks third worldwide in generation of electricity through geothermal energy. The benefits of the geothermal energy include lesser carbon footprint, sustainability, and renewability. Lesser carbon footprint means that geothermal energy does not contribute to air pollution. This is the reason why a lot of scientists push for further development of geothermal energy in the country. 1. Why is it said that geothermal energy is a form of green energy? 2.

The paragraph must contain 50-100 words. A rubric will be used to rate your work. Do this in a separate sheet of paper. Situation: An energy generating company would like to establish a run-off-river hydroelectric power plant in the existing dams in the province of Mapayapa. This type of facility works through redirecting river water flow through canals and feeding it downhill to a power station. At present, there are two dams situated in the mountainous terrain of Mapayapa and these are Kapayapaan Dam and Kabutihan Dam. Kapayapaan Dam has a height of 85 meters above sea level (masl). While the Kabutihan Dam has a height of 125 masl. For the run-off-river power plant to produce greater electric power, engineers must consider the gravitational potential energy possess by the dams. This energy should be enough to be converted into kinetic energy that will be used to turn the turbine at the powerhouse. They have to consider the location of the dam and where to build the powerhouse. If you were to be a member of the company that handles this project, what will be your suggestions? Which of the two dams will be ideal for the project and why?

                            5. All children have a set of genetic instructions that influence their characteristics at birth and emerging physical features as the grow.” Some characteristics awaken during sensitive periods which are age ranges in which environmental experiences are necessary for the child’s development. Other characteristics are controlled by genetics, this is known as canalization. Skills that are canalized include motor skills such as crawling and sitting. Skills that are not canalized are those that children are taught in school such as reading and writing. The environment continues to play a huge role in the genetic expression at different times throughout development. Nature and nurture are powerful and they are concepts that not only teachers, but also parents need to be aware of, being the adults in a child’s life. Genetic predispositions may be altered by environmental factors such as schooling, social interactions, and physical experiences.

Geothermal energy is very common in areas that have active volcanoes, such as places within the region called the Pacific Ring of Fire. The Philippines is one of the best examples of countries that utilize geothermal energy. In fact, the Philippines ranks third worldwide in generation of electricity through geothermal energy. The benefits of the geothermal energy include lesser carbon footprint, sustainability, and renewability. Lesser carbon footprint means that geothermal energy does not contribute to air pollution. This is the reason why a lot of scientists push for further development of geothermal energy in the country. 1. Why is it said that geothermal energy is a form of green energy? 2. Why is the Philippines an ideal country for the development of geothermal power? Can utilization of geothermal power affect the atmosphere for the better? How? 3.

                            21. What I Can Do Read the situation carefully. Analyze the problem discussed in the situation and write a short paragraph containing your suggestions on the problem. Support your suggestions by facts you have learned about work, energy and power. The paragraph must contain 50-100 words. A rubric will be used to rate your work. Do this in a separate sheet of paper. Situation: An energy generating company would like to establish a run-off-river hydroelectric power plant in the existing dams in the province of Mapayapa. This type of facility works through redirecting river water flow through canals and feeding it downhill to a power station. At present, there are two dams situated in the mountainous terrain of Mapayapa and these are Kapayapaan Dam and Kabutihan Dam. Kapayapaan Dam has a height of 85 meters above sea level (masl). While the Kabutihan Dam has a height of 125 masl. For the run-off-river power plant to produce greater electric power, engineers must consider the gravitational potential energy possess by the dams. This energy should be enough to be converted into kinetic energy that will be used to turn the turbine at the powerhouse. They have to consider the location of the dam and where to build the powerhouse. If you were to be a member of the company that handles this project, what will be your suggestions? Which of the two dams will be ideal for the project and why? Rubrics for Run-Off-River Hydroelectric Power Plant Project Suggestion Criteria Suggestion Explanation and Analysis Mechanics (spelling and grammar) 5 The given suggestions are well developed with relevant details supporting it. Concise and clear explanation and analysis of the situation are evident in the paragraph. There is careful editing in the mechanics. 3 The given suggestions are developed with limited details supporting it. Explanation and analysis of the situation are somehow concise and clear in the paragraph. There are errors in the mechanics that are distracting at times. 1 The given suggestions are not developed.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Because of the heat produced by earth for millions of years. Because geothermal power does not produce greenhouse gases (GHG) that are harmful to the environment.They can have a positive effect by reducing the use of energy sources that may have negative effects on the environment. <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Because its source is the almost unlimited amount of heat generated by the Earth's core. Even in geothermal areas dependent on a reservoir of hot water, the volume taken out can be reinjected, making it a sustainable energy source.</p><p></p><p>2. It is considerably safer than most other energy sources. Unlike fossil fuel plants, geothermal power does not produce greenhouse gases (GHG) that are harmful to the environment.
